you with the data of boys and girls studying in the classroom. Study the difference if any and explain for reasons in the classroom. as stated in the Budget Documents of Union State Governments, Reserve Bank of India, the expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP has declined to 2.8% in 2020-21 (B.E.) The literacy rates have increased from 18% in 1951 to 85% in 2018. Literacy is not only a right, it is also needed if the citizens are to perform their duties and enjoy their rights properly. However, a vast difference is noticed across different sections of the population. Literacy among males is nearly 16.1% higher than females and it is about 14.2% higher in urban areas as compared to rural areas. As per 2011 census, literacy rates varied from 94% in Kerala to 62% in Bihar. The primary school system (I-V) has expanded to over 7,78,842 lakh in 2019-20. Unfortunately, this huge expansion of schools has been diluted by the poor quality of schooling and high dropout rates. Samagra Shiksha is a significant step for the school education sector extending from pre-school to Class XII, with the broader goal ofimproving school effectiveness measured in terms of equal opportunities for schooling and equitable learning outcomes. The scheme envisages the school as the continuum from pre-school, primary, middle to secondary levels and attempts to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education from pre-school to secondary stage in accordance with the Sustainable Develompent Goals. Mid-day meal scheme has been implemented to encourage attendance and retention of children and improve their nutritional status. These policies could add to the literate population of India. The Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education in the age group of 18 to 23 years is 27% in 2020-21, which would be broadly in line with world average. The strategy focuses on increasing access, quality, adoption of state-specific curriculum modification, vocationalisation and networking on the use of information technology. There is also focus on distance education, convergence of formal, non-formal, distance and IT education institutions.
