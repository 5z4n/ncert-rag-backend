just an expression of poverty, it brings about poverty. The attainment of food security therefore involves eliminating current hunger and reducing the risks of future hunger. Hunger has chronic and seasonal dimensions. Chronic hunger is a consequence of diets persistently inadequate in terms of quantity and/or The quality. Poor people suffer from chronic hunger because of their very low income and in turn inability to buy food even for survival. Seasonal hunger is related to cycles of food growing and harvesting. This is prevalent in rural areas because of the seasonal nature of agricultural activities and in urban areas because of casual labourers, e.g., there is less work for casual construction labourers during the rainy season. This type of hunger exists when a person is unable to get work for the entire year.

India is aiming at Self-sufficiency in Foodgrains since Independence. After Independence, Indian policymakers adopted all measures to achieve self-sufficiency in food grains. India adopted a new strategy in agriculture, which resulted in Green Revolution , especially in the production of wheat and rice. Indira Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of India, officially recorded the impressive strides of Green Revolution in agriculture by releasing a special stamp entitled Wheat Revolution in July 1968. The Economics Picture 4.3 A farmer from Punjab standing in a field of one of the High Yielding Varieties of wheat on which the Green Revolution is based success of wheat was later replicated in rice. The increase in foodgrains was, however, disproportionate. The highest rate of growth was achieved in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, which was 58 and 33 million tonnes in 2020-21. The total foodgrain production was 310 Million tonnes in 2020-21 and it has changed to 315 million tonnes in 2021-22. Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh recorded a significant production in field of wheat which was 36 and 18 million tonnes in 2020-21, respectively. West Bengal and UP, on the other hand, recorded significant production of rice 17 and 16 Million tonnes in 2020-21 respectively. kg ae Suggested Activity Visit some farms in a nearby village and collect the details of food crops cultivated by the farmers. Food Security in India Since the advent of the Green Revolution in the early-1970s, the country has avoided famine even during adverse weather conditions. India has become self-sufficient in foodgrains during the last 30 years because of a variety of crops grown all over the country.
