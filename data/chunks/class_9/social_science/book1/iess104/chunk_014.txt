Now find out (i) Why are Thiruvananthapuram and Shillong rainier in June than in July? (ii) Why is July rainier in Mumbai than in Thiruvananthapuram? (iii) Why are southwest monsoons less rainy in Chennai? (iv) Why is Shillong rainier than Kolkata? (v) Why is Kolkata rainier in July than in June unlike Shillong which is rainier in June than in July? (vi) Why does Delhi receive more rain than Jodhpur? Now think why Thiruvananthapuram has equable climate? Chennai has more rains only after the fury of monsoon is over in most parts of the country? Jodhpur has a hot desert type of climate? Leh has moderate precipitation almost throughut the year? while in Delhi and Jodhpur most of the rain is confined to nearly three months, in Thiruvananthapuram and Shillong it is almost nine months of the year? In spite of these facts see carefully if there are strong evidences to conclude that the monsoons still provide a very strong framework lending overall climatic unity to the whole country.
