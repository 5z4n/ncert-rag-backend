Reprint 2025-26 POPULATION India s Population Distribution by Density Population density provides a better picture of the uneven distribution. Population density is calculated as the number of persons per unit area. India is one of the most densely populated countries of the world. Only Bangladesh and Japan have |DoYou Know, higher average population densities than India. Find out the population densities of Bangladesh and Japan. Rest of the world, 82.5% Rest of the world, 97.6% The population density of India in the year 2011 was 382 persons per sq km. Densities vary from 1,102 persons per sq km in Bihar to only 17 persons per sq km in Arunachal India, 2.4% Pradesh.

Do you find any corelation between these maps? Note the States with population densities below 250 persons per square km. Rugged terrain and unfavourable climatic conditions are primarily responsible for sparse population in these areas. Which states have density below 250 persons per square km? Assam and most of the Peninsular states have moderate population densities. Hilly, dissected and rocky nature of the terrain, moderate to low rainfall, shallow and less fertile soils have influenced population densities in these areas. The Northern plains and Kerala in the south have high to very high population densities because of the flat plains with fertile soils and abundant rainfall. Identify the three states of the Northern Plains with high population densities. PopPpuLATION GROWTH AND PROCESSES
