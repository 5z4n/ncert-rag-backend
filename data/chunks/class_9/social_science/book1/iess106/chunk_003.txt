in the 1990s alone (an annual addition larger than ever before). It is essential to realise that India has a very large population. When a low annual rate is applied to a very large population, it yields a large absolute increase. When more than a billion people increase even at a lower rate, the total number being added becomes very large. India s annual increase in population is large enough to neutralise efforts to conserve the resource endowment and environment. The declining trend of the growth rate is indeed a positive indicator of the efforts of birth control. Despite that, the total additions to the population base continue to grow, and India Reprint 2025-26 Lu x 26 24.8 24.66 = 0 23.87 o 21.64 3 20 21.54 a wm 20 a oO 18 17.64 < Zz 4H 16 ing lu o 14 8 5 8 8 Ss S 7 7 + i % ay e India Fig. 6.4(a): India s Population Growth Rates during 1951-2011 1400.00 4200.00 1210.19 1000.00 800.00 600.00 400.00 POPULATION (IN MILLION) 200.00 0.00 1901 1911 1921 1931 1941 1951 1961 1971 1981 1991 2001 2011 Fig. 6.4(b): India s Population 1901-2011 has overtaken China in 2023 to become the most The natural increase of population is the populous country in the world.

The main cause of the rate of growth of the Indian population has been the rapid decline in death rates. Till 1980, high birth rates and declining death rates led to a large difference between birth rates and death rates resulting in higher rates of population growth. Since 1981, birth rates have also started declining gradually, resulting in a gradual decline in the rate of population growth. What are the reasons for this trend? The third component of population growth is migration. Migration is the movement of people across regions and territories. Migration can be internal (within the country) or international (between the countries). Internal migration does not change the size of the population, but influences the distribution of population within the nation. Migration plays a very significant role in changing the composition and distribution of population. Activity On a map, trace the migration of each of your grandparents and parents since their birth. Try and analyse the reasons for each move. In India, most migrations have been from rural to urban areas because of the push factor in rural areas. These are adverse conditions of poverty and unemployment in the rural areas and the pull of the city in terms of increased employment
