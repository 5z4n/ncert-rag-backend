points : 1. To locate the position of an object or a point in a plane, we require two perpendicular lines. One of them is horizontal, and the other is vertical. The plane is called the Cartesian, or coordinate plane and the lines are called the coordinate axes. The horizontal line is called the x -axis, and the vertical line is called the y - axis.

The distance of a point from the y - axis is called its x-coordinate, or abscissa, and the distance of the point from the x-axis is called its y-coordinate, or ordinate. If the abscissa of a point is x and the ordinate is y, then (x, y) are called the coordinates of the point. The coordinates of a point on the x-axis are of the form (x, 0) and that of the point on the y-axis are (0, y). The coordinates of the origin are (0, 0). The coordinates of a point are of the form (+ , +) in the first quadrant, ( , +) in the second quadrant, ( , ) in the third quadrant and (+, ) in the fourth quadrant, where + denotes a positive real number and denotes a negative real number. Ifx #y, then (x, y) #(v, x), and (x, y) = (v, x), ifx=y. Reprint 2025-26
