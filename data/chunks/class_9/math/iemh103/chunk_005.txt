Reprint 2025-26 50 MATHEMATICS Fig. 3.11 Solution: (i) Since the distance of the point B from the y - axis is 4 units, the x - coordinate or abscissa of the point B is 4. The distance of the point B from the x - axis is 3 units; therefore, the y - coordinate, 1.e., the ordinate, of the point B is 3. Hence, the coordinates of the point B are (4, 3). As in (i) above : (ii) The x- coordinate and the y - coordinate of the point M are 3 and 4, respectively. Hence, the coordinates of the point M are (3, 4). (iit) The x - coordinate and the y - coordinate of the point L are 5 and 4, respectively. Hence, the coordinates of the point L are ( S, 4). (iv) The x- coordinate and the y- coordinate of the point S are 3 and 4, respectively. Hence, the coordinates of the point S are (3, 4). Reprint 2025-26 COORDINATE GEOMETRY 51 Example 2 : Write the coordinates of the points marked on the axes in Fig. 3.12. Solution : You can see that : (1) The point A is at a distance of + 4 units from the y - axis and at a distance zero from the x - axis. Therefore, the x - coordinate of A is 4 and the y - coordinate is 0. Hence, the coordinates of A are (4, 0). (ii) The coordinates of B are (0, 3). Why? (it) The coordinates of C are ( 5, 0). Why? (iv) The coordinates of D are (0, 4). Why? (v) The coordinates of E are [= 0 . Why? Since every point on the x - axis has no distance (zero distance) from the x - axis, therefore, the y - coordinate of every point lying on the x - axis is always zero. Thus, the coordinates of any point on the x - axis are of the form (x, 0), where x is the distance of the point from the y - axis. Similarly, the coordinates of any point on the y - axis are of the form (0, v), where y is the distance of the point from the x - axis. Why? What are the coordinates of the origin O? It has zero distance from both the axes so that its abscissa and ordinate are both zero. Therefore, the coordinates of the origin are (0, 9). In the examples above, you may have observed the following relationship between the signs of the coordinates of a point and the quadrant of a point in which it lies. (i) Ifa point is in the 1st quadrant, then the point will
