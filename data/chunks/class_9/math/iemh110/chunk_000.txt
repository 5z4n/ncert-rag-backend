HERON S FORMULA ee 10.1 Area of a Triangle by Heron s Formula We know that the area of triangle when its height is given, is 5 x base x height. Now suppose that we know the lengths of the sides of a scalene triangle and not the height. Can you still find its area? For instance, you have a triangular park whose sides are 40 m, 32 m, and 24 m. How will you calculate its area? Definitely 1f you want to apply the formula, you will have to calculate its height. But we do not have a clue to calculate the height. Try doing so. If you are not able to get it, then go to the next section. Heron was born in about 10AD possibly in Alexandria in Egypt. He worked in applied mathematics. His works on mathematical and physical subjects are so numerous and varied that he is considered to be an encyclopedic writer in these fields. His geometrical works deal largely with problems on mensuration written in three books. Book I deals with the area of squares, rectangles, triangles, trapezoids (trapezia), various other specialised quadrilaterals, the regular polygons, circles, surfaces of cylinders, cones, spheres etc. In this book, Heron has derived the famous formula for the area of a triangle in Heron (10 C.E. 75 C.E.) terms of its three sides. Fig. 10.1 The formula given by Heron about the area of a triangle, is also known as Hero s formula. It is stated as: Area of a triangle = ./s(s a) (s b)(s c) (1) Reprint 2025-26 132 MATHEMATICS where a, b and c are the sides of the triangle, and s = semi-perimeter, i.e., half the at+b+c This formula is helpful where it is not possible to find the height of the triangle easily. Let us apply it to calculate the area of the triangular park ABC, mentioned above (see Fig. 10.2). Let us take a = 40 m, b = 24 m, c = 32 m, perimeter of the triangle = A 40 + 244+ 32 so that we have s = 5 m = 48 m. 32m 24m s a=(48 40) m=8 m, s b=(48 24)m=24m, B 40an c s c=(48 32)m= 16m. Fig, 10.2 Therefore, area of the park ABC s(s a) (s b) (s -c) = [48 x8 x 24x 16m?= 384m? We see that 32? + 24? = 1024 + 576 = 1600 = 40 . Therefore, the sides of the park make a right triangle. The largest side, i.e., BC which is 40 m will be the hypotenuse and the angle between the sides AB and AC will be 90 . We can check that the area of the park is 5 x 32 x 24 m = 384 m . We find that the area we have got is the same as we found by using Heron s formula. Now using Heron s formula, you verify this fact by finding the areas of other triangles discussed
