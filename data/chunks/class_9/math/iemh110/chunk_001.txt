side, i.e., BC which is 40 m will be the hypotenuse and the angle between the sides AB and AC will be 90 . We can check that the area of the park is 5 x 32 x 24 m = 384 m . We find that the area we have got is the same as we found by using Heron s formula. Now using Heron s formula, you verify this fact by finding the areas of other triangles discussed earlier viz., (i) equilateral triangle with side 10 cm. (ii) isosceles triangle with unequal side as 8 cm and each equal side as 5 cm. You will see that 10+10+10 For (i), we have s = 5 cm = 15 cm. Reprint 2025-26 HERON S FORMULA 133 Area of triangle = ,/15(15 10) (15 10) (15 10) cm? = /15x5x5x5 cm? = 25y3 cm? . 8+54+5 For (ii), we have s = cm =9cm Area of triangle = /9(9 8) (9 5) (9-5) em?= 9x 1x 4x 4cm?=12 cm . Let us now solve some more examples: Example 1 : Find the area of a triangle, two sides of which are 8 cm and 11 cm and the perimeter is 32 cm (see Fig. 10.3). Solution : Here we have perimeter of the triangle = 32 cm, a = 8 cm and 6 = 11 cm. Third side c = 32 cm (8 + 11) cm= 13 cm C So, 2s = 32,1.e.,5 = 16cm, lhcm 8 cm s a=(16 8)cm=8 cm, s b= (16-11)cm=S5 cm, A B s c= (16-13) cm=3 cm. Fig. 10.3 Therefore, area of the triangle = Js(s a)(s b)(s- c) = [16x 8x 5x3cm?= 8/30 cm? Example 2 : A triangular park ABC has sides 120m, 80m and 50m (see Fig. 10.4). A gardener Dhania has to put a fence all around it and also plant grass inside. How much area does she need to plant? Find the cost of fencing it with barbed wire at the rate of 20 per metre leaving a space 3m wide for a gate on one side. Solution : For finding area of the park, we have = 4 | _ A 2s = 50m+80m-+ 120 m= 250 m. 50m 80m Le., s= 125m Now, s a= (125- 120)m=5m, B C s b= (125- 80)m=45 m, < _ 120 mn s c= (125 50)m=75 m. Fig. 10.4 Reprint 2025-26 134 MATHEMATICS Therefore, area of the park = Js(s a)(s b)(s- c) = f125x5x 45x75 m = 375J/15 m Also, perimeter of the park = AB + BC +CA= 250m Therefore, length of the wire needed for fencing = 250 m 3 m (to be left for gate) = 247m And so the cost of fencing = 20 = 247 = $4940 Example 3 : The sides of a triangular plot are in the ratio of 3 : 5 : 7 and its perimeter is 300 m. Find its area. Solution : Suppose that the sides, in metres, are 3x,
