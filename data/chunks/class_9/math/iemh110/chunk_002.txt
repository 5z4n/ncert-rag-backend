perimeter of the park = AB + BC +CA= 250m Therefore, length of the wire needed for fencing = 250 m 3 m (to be left for gate) = 247m And so the cost of fencing = 20 = 247 = $4940 Example 3 : The sides of a triangular plot are in the ratio of 3 : 5 : 7 and its perimeter is 300 m. Find its area. Solution : Suppose that the sides, in metres, are 3x, 5x and 7x (see Fig. 10.5). Then, we know that 3x + 5x + 7x = 300 (perimeter of the triangle) Therefore, 15x = 300, which gives x = 20. So the sides of the triangle are 3 x 20 m, 5 x 20 m and 7 x 20m 1.e., 60m, 100 mand 140 m. 5x Can you now find the area [Using Heron s formula]? y 60 +100 + 140 * We have s = 5 m= 150m, Fig. 10.5 and area will be ,/150(150 60) (150 100) (150 140) m? 150 x 90 x50 x 10 m? = 1500.3 m? EXERCISE 10.1 1. Atraffic signal board, indicating SCHOOL AHEAD , is an equilateral triangle with side a . Find the area of the signal board, using Heron s formula. If its perimeter is 180 cm, what will be the area of the signal board? Reprint 2025-26 HERON S FORMULA 135 2. 3. The triangular side walls of a flyover have been used for advertisements. The sides of the walls are 122 m, 22 m and 120 m (see Fig. 10.6). The advertisements yield an earning of 5000 per m per year. A company hired one of its walls for 3 months. How much rent did it pay? Fig. 10.6 There is a slide in a park. One of its side walls has been painted in some colour with a message KEEP THE PARK GREEN AND CLEAN (see Fig. 10.7 ). If the sides of the wall are 15 m, 11 mand 6 m, find the area painted in colour. KEEP THE PARK GREEN AND CLEAN 15m Fig. 10.7 Find the area ofa triangle two sides of which are 18cm and 10cm and the perimeter is 42cm. Sides of a triangle are in the ratio of 12 : 17 : 25 and its perimeter is 540cm. Find its area. An isosceles triangle has perimeter 30 cm and each of the equal sides is 12 cm. Find the area of the triangle. Reprint 2025-26 136 MATHEMATICS 10.2 Summary In this chapter, you have studied the following points : 1. Area of a triangle with its sides as a, b and c is calculated by using Heron s formula, stated as Area of triangle = Js(s a) (s b) (s -c) atbt+e hi = where Ss 2 Reprint 2025-26
