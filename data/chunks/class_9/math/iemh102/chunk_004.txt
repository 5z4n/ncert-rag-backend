If we replace x by | everywhere in p(x), we get pl)=5%* Up-2x (+3 * U)-2 =5-2+3-2 =4 So, we say that the value of p(x) at x = | is 4. Similarly, p(O) = 5(0)? 2(0)? + 3(0) 2 =-2 Can you find p(-1)? Example 2 : Find the value of each of the following polynomials at the indicated value of variables: (i) p(x) =5x*-3x+7atx=1. (i) gy) = 3y 4y + VET at y=2. (ii) pt) =404+ 58 -f + 6att=a. Reprint 2025-26 30 MATHEMATICS Solution : (i) p(x) = 5x?- 3x +7 The value of the polynomial p(x) at x = | is given by pl) = 51-30) +7 =5-3+7=9 (ii) gQ) = 3 -4y + V1 The value of the polynomial g(y) at y = 2 is given by q(2) = 3(2)3 4(2) + VIl = 24-84 Vil =16+ Vil (iii) p(t) =4 + 5P-P +6 The value of the polynomial p(A) at t= a is given by P(a) = 4a4* + 5a - a? +6 Now, consider the polynomial p(x) = x- 1. What is p(1)? Note that: p11) =1-1=0. As p(1) = 0, we say that | is a zero of the polynomial p(x). Similarly, you can check that 2 is a zero of g(x), where q(x) = x 2. In general, we say that a zero of a polynomial p(x) is a number c such that p(c) = 0. You must have observed that the zero of the polynomial x 1 is obtained by equating it to 0, i.e., x 1 = 0, which gives x = 1. We say p(x) = 0 is a polynomial equation and | is the root of the polynomial equation p(x) = 0. So we say | is the zero of the polynomial x 1, or a root of the polynomial equation x 1 = 0. Now, consider the constant polynomial 5. Can you tell what its zero is? It has no zero because replacing x by any number in 5x still gives us 5. In fact, a
