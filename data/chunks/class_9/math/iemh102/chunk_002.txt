... +x?+x+ 1 isa polynomial with 151 terms. Consider the polynomials 2x, 2, 5x?, 5x , y and u*. Do you see that each of these polynomials has only one term? Polynomials having only one term are called monomials ( mono means one ). Now observe each of the following polynomials: P@)=xt1, g@=P-x r= Hl, tuys uw How many terms are there in each of these? Each of these polynomials has only two terms. Polynomials having only two terms are called binomials ( b1 means two ). Similarly, polynomials having only three terms are called trinomials ( tri means three ). Some examples of trinomials are DwX)axtxt+n, g(x) =/2 +x-x, r(u)= u+w- 2, (yy=yit+yt5. Now, look at the polynomial p(x) = 3x 4x + x + 9. What is the term with the highest power of x ? It is 3x . The exponent of x in this term is 7. Similarly, in the polynomial g(v) = 5y 4y 6, the term with the highest power of y is 5y and the exponent of y in this term is 6. We call the highest power of the variable in a polynomial as the degree of the polynomial. So, the degree of the polynomial 3x7 4x + x + 9 is 7 and the degree of the polynomial 5 4y 6 is 6. The degree of a non-zero constant polynomial is zero. Example 1 : Find the degree of each of the polynomials given below: (i) xr x4+3 (ii) 2-y y?> + 278 (iii) 2 Solution : (i) The highest power of the variable is 5. So, the degree of the polynomial is 5. (ii) The highest power of the variable is 8. So, the degree of the polynomial is 8. (iil) The only term here is 2 which can be written as 2x . So the exponent of x is 0. Therefore, the degree of the polynomial is 0. Reprint 2025-26 28 MATHEMATICS Now observe the polynomials p(x) = 4x + 5, g(y) = 2y, r(t) = t + V2 and s(u) = 3 u. Do you see anything common among all of them? The degree of each of these polynomials is one. A polynomial of degree one is called a linear polynomial. Some more linear polynomials in one variable are 2x 1, 2 y+1,2- u.Now, try and find a linear polynomial in x with 3 terms? You would not be able to find it because a linear polynomial in x can have at most two terms. So, any linear polynomial in x will be of the form ax + b, where a and 6 are constants and a # 0 (why?). Similarly, ay + bisa linear polynomial in y. Now consider the polynomials : 2x? +5, 5x? + 3x4+ 7, x? and x? + 5% Do you agree that they are all of degree two? A polynomial of degree two is called a quadratic polynomial. Some examples of a quadratic polynomial are 5 y , 4y + 5y and
