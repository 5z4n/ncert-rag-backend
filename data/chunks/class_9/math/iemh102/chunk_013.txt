A polynomial p(x) in one variable x is an algebraic expression in x of the form P(Xx)=ax"ta x"! +... aet+axta, where a,, @,,4,,...,@, are constants and a, #0. Ay, 4), ,,..., 4, are respectively the coefficients of x , x, x , ...,x , and is called the degree of the polynomial. Each ofa x", a, ,x""', ...,@,, with a, #0, is called a term of the polynomial P(x). A polynomial of one term is called a monomial. A polynomial of two terms is called a binomial. A polynomial of three terms is called a trinomial. A polynomial of degree one is called a linear polynomial. A polynomial of degree two is called a quadratic polynomial. A polynomial of degree three is called a cubic polynomial. A real number a is a zero of a polynomial p(x) if p(a) = 0. In this case, a is also called a root of the equation p(x) = 0. Every linear polynomial in one variable has a unique zero, a non-zero constant polynomial has no zero, and every real number is a zero of the zero polynomial. Factor Theorem : x a is a factor of the polynomial p(x), if p(a) = 0. Also, if x a is a factor of p(x), then p(a) = 0.
