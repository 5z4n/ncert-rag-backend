You are already familiar with the factorisation of a quadratic polynomial like x? + lx +m. You had factorised it by splitting the middle term /x as ax + bx so that ab =m. Then x + lx + m= (x + a) (x + b). We shall now try to factorise quadratic polynomials of the type ax? + bx + c, where a # 0 and a, b, c are constants. Factorisation of the polynomial ax? + bx + c by splitting the middle term is as follows: 3x7 Let its factors be (px + g) and (7x +).Then x. t qr) x + qs = 3x = first term of quotient ax? + bx +c = (px + q) (rx +s) = pr x? + (ps Comparing the coefficients of x , we get a = pr. Similarly, comparing the coefficients of x, we get b = ps + qr. And, on comparing the constant terms, we get c = qs. This shows us that b is the sum of two numbers ps and qr, whose product is (ps\(qr) = (pr)(qs) = ac. Therefore, to factorise ax? + bx + c, we have to write b as the sum of two numbers whose product is ac. This will be clear from Example 13. Example 8 : Factorise 6x? + 17x + 5 by splitting the middle term, and by using the Factor Theorem. Solution 1 : (By splitting method) : If we can find two numbers p and q such that pt+q=17 and pq=6 x 5 = 30, then we can get the factors. So, let us look for the pairs of factors of 30. Some are 1 and 30, 2 and 15, 3 and 10, 5 and 6. Of these pairs, 2 and 15 will give us p+ g =17. Reprint 2025-26 34 MATHEMATICS So, 6x + 17x +5 = 6x +(2+ 15)x+5 = 6x + 2x + 15x +5 = 2x(3x + 1) + 5(3x + 1) = (3x+ 1) (2x +5) Solution 2 : (Using the Factor Theorem) 17 5 6x7 + 17x+5= 6 + 67 + *) = 6 p(x), say. If a and b are the zeroes of p(x), then 6x? + 17x +5 = 6(x a) (x b). So, ab= 6 Let us look at some possibilities for a and b. They could be pt 42 41. Now, Pp ! 1, d A # 0. But 2 3 3 2 2) 4 6\2) 6 | 1 (=) = 0. So, [ + :) is a factor of p(x). Similarly, by trial, you can find that [ + 5) is a factor of p(x). ? (2 + [2 + *) 3 2 = (3x+ 1) (2x+5) For the example above, the use of the
