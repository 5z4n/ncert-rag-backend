It tells us that since the remainder, o(-3) = 0, (2t+ 1) is a factor of g(d, 1. ., g() = (2t + 1) g(A) for some polynomial g(t). This is a particular case of the following theorem. Factor Theorem : If p(x) is a polynomial of degree n > 1 and a is any real number, then (i) x a isa factor of p(x), if p(a) = 0, and (ii) p(a) = 0, if x a is a factor of p(x). Proof: By the Remainder Theorem, p(x)=(x a) g(x) + p(a). (i) Ifp(a)=0, then p(x) = (x a) g(x), which shows that x a is a factor of p(x). (ii) Since x a is a factor of p(x), p(x) = ( a) g(x) for same polynomial g(x). In this case, p(a) = (a a) g(a) = 0. Example 6 : Examine whether x + 2 is a factor of x3 + 3x? + 5x + 6 and of 2x + 4. Solution ; The zero of x + 2 is 2. Let p(x) =x? + 3x? + 5x + 6 and s(x) = 2x+ 4 Then, p(-2) = (2) + 3(-2) + 5(-2) + 6 =-8+12-10+6 =0 Reprint 2025-26 POLYNOMIALS 33 So, by the Factor Theorem, x + 2 is a factor of x* + 3x + 5x + 6. Again, s(-2) = 2(-2) +4=0 So, x + 2 is a factor of 2x + 4. In fact, you can check this without applying the Factor Theorem, since 2x + 4 = 2(x + 2). Example 7 : Find the value of k, if x 1 is a factor of 4x + 3x 4x + k. Solution : As x 1 is a factor of p(x) = 4x + 3x 4x + k, p(1) = 0 Now, pC) = 4(1) + 301)? 41) + & So, 4+3-4+k=0 Le., k=-3 We will now use the Factor Theorem to factorise some polynomials of degree 2 and 3. You are already familiar with the factorisation of a quadratic polynomial like x? + lx +m. You had factorised it by splitting the middle term /x as ax + bx so that ab =m. Then x + lx + m= (x
