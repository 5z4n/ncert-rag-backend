You have studied the following algebraic identities in earlier classes: Identity] :(wt+yp~paert2yt+y Identity Il :@-yP=x-2xyt+y Identity III :x -y=(x + y) -y) Identity lV :(x+a)(x+b)=x + (a+ b)x + ab You must have also used some of these algebraic identities to factorise the algebraic expressions. You can also see their utility in computations. Example 11 : Find the following products using appropriate identities: (i) @@ + 3)@ + 3) (ii) ( 3) @& +5) Solution : (1) Here we can use Identity I : (x + y)? =x? + 2xy + y*. Putting y = 3 in it, we get (ii) Using Identity IV above, i.e., (x + a) (x (x + 3) x +3) = (& + 3P =x? + 2(@)(3) + BY =x + 6x+9 b) =x? + (a+ b)x + ab, we have (x 3) @ + 5) = x + (-3 + 5)x + (-3)5) = x7+2x -15 Reprint 2025-26 POLYNOMIALS 37 Example 12 : Evaluate 105 x 106 without multiplying directly. Solution : 105 x 106 = (100 + 5) x (100 + 6) (100)? + (5 + 6) (100) + (5 x 6), using Identity IV 10000 + 1100+ 30 You have seen some uses of the identities listed above in finding the product of some given expressions. These identities are useful in factorisation of algebraic expressions also, as you can see in the following examples. Example 13 : Factorise: (i) 49a? + 70ab + 250 (ii) 2x -= Solution : (i) Here you can see that 49a? = (Ja), 25b? = (5b) , 70ab = 2(7a) (5b) Comparing the given expression with x? + 2xy + y*, we observe that x = 7a and y = 5b. Using Identity I, we get 49a? + 70ab + 25h? = (Ja + 5by = (7a + 5b) (7a + 5d) 2 2 2 (11) We have 25 vit. > x y 4 9 2 3 Now
