look at some possibilities for a and b. They could be pt 42 41. Now, Pp ! 1, d A # 0. But 2 3 3 2 2) 4 6\2) 6 | 1 (=) = 0. So, [ + :) is a factor of p(x). Similarly, by trial, you can find that [ + 5) is a factor of p(x). ? (2 + [2 + *) 3 2 = (3x+ 1) (2x+5) For the example above, the use of the splitting method appears more efficient. However, let us consider another example. Therefore, 6x7 + 17x +5= (1 + 4 Es + 5) Example 9 : Factorise y* 5y + 6 by using the Factor Theorem. Solution : Let p(y) = 5y + 6. Now, if p(v) = (v a) (v 5), you know that the constant term will be ab. So, ab = 6. So, to look for the factors of p(y), we look at the factors of 6. The factors of 6 are 1, 2 and 3. Now, p(2)=2?-(5 x 2)+6=0 So, y- 2 isa factor of p(y). Reprint 2025-26 POLYNOMIALS 35 Also, p(3)=3?-(5 x 3)+6=0 So, y 3 is also a factor of y 5y + 6. Therefore, y? 5y+6=(y 2)(y -3) Note that y? 5y + 6 can also be factorised by splitting the middle term 5y. Now, let us consider factorising cubic polynomials. Here, the splitting method will not be appropriate to start with. We need to find at least one factor first, as you will see in the following example. Example 10 : Factorise x? 23x? + 142x 120. Solution : Let p(x) = x7 23x? + 142x 120 We shall now look for all the factors of -120. Some of these are 4, +5, +6, +8, +10, +12, +15, +20, +24, +30, +60. By trial, we find that p(1) = 0. So x 1 is a factor of p(x). Now we see that x? 23x? + 142x 120 = x3 x* 22x + 22x + 120x 120 = x7(x -1) 22x(x 1) + 120(x- 1) (Why?) = (x 1) (x? 22x +120) [Taking (x 1) common] We could have also got this by dividing p(x) by x 1. N [oS) Now x? 22x + 120 can be factorised either by splitting the middle term or by using the Factor theorem. By splitting the middle term, we have: x? 22x + 120 = x? 12x 10x + 120 = x(x 12) 10(x - 12) = (x 12) (x- 10) So, x3 23x? 142x 120 = (x 1)(x 10)(x 12) EXERCISE 2.3 1.
