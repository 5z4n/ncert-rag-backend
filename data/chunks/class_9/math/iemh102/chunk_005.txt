gives x = 1. We say p(x) = 0 is a polynomial equation and | is the root of the polynomial equation p(x) = 0. So we say | is the zero of the polynomial x 1, or a root of the polynomial equation x 1 = 0. Now, consider the constant polynomial 5. Can you tell what its zero is? It has no zero because replacing x by any number in 5x still gives us 5. In fact, a non-zero constant polynomial has no zero. What about the zeroes of the zero polynomial? By convention, every real number is a zero of the zero polynomial. Example 3 : Check whether 2 and 2 are zeroes of the polynomial x + 2. Solution : Let p(x) =x + 2. Then p(2) =2+2=4, p(-2) = 2+2=0 Therefore, 2 is a zero of the polynomial x + 2, but 2 is not. Example 4: Find a zero of the polynomial p(x) = 2x + 1. Solution : Finding a zero of p(x), is the same as solving the equation P(x) = 0 Reprint 2025-26 POLYNOMIALS 31 Now, 2x + 1= 0 gives us x= ~ > So, 5 is a zero of the polynomial 2x + 1. Now, if p(x) = ax + b, a # 0, 1s a linear polynomial, how can we find a zero of p(x)? Example 4 may have given you some idea. Finding a zero of the polynomial p(x), amounts to solving the polynomial equation p(x) = 0. Now, p(x) = 0 means ax+b=0,a#0 So, ax = b . b i.e., x=-7: a b ; So, x= 738 the only zero of p(x), i.e., a inear polynomial has one and only one zero. Now we can say that | is the zero of x 1, and 2 is the zero of x + 2. Example 5: Verify whether 2 and 0 are zeroes of the polynomial x? 2x. Solution : Let P(x) =x? 2x Then p(2)=22-4=4-4=0 and p(0) =0-0=0 Hence, 2 and 0 are both zeroes of the polynomial x? 2x. Let us now list our observations: (i) A zero of a polynomial need not be 0. (ii) 0 may be a zero of a polynomial. (iti) Every linear polynomial has one and only one zero. (iv) A polynomial can have more than one zero. EXERCISE 2.2 1.
