with other algebraic expressions like 2x, x? + 2x, x3 x7 + 4x + 7. Note that, all the algebraic expressions we have considered so far have only whole numbers as the exponents of the variable. Expressions of this form are called polynomials in one variable. Inthe examples P Y Q above, the variable is x. For instance, x7> x? + 4x +7 isa polynomial in x. Similarly, 3y? + 5y is a polynomial in the variable y and + 4 is a polynomial in the variable t. Fig. 2.2 In the polynomial x* + 2x, the expressions x? and 2x are called the terms of the polynomial. Similarly, the polynomial 3y* + 5y +7 has three terms, namely, 3), 5y and 7. Can you write the terms of the polynomial =x? + 4x? + 7x 2 ? This polynomial has 4 terms, namely, x , 4x , 7x and 2. Each term of a polynomial has a coefficient. So, in x? + 4x? + 7x 2, the coefficient of x* is 1, the coefficient of x? is 4, the coefficient of x is 7 and 2 is the coefficient of x (Remember, x = 1). Do you know the coefficient of x in x? x + 7? It is 1. 2 is also a polynomial. In fact, 2,5, 7, etc. are examples of constant polynomials. The constant polynomial 0 is called the zero polynomial. This plays a very important role in the collection of all polynomials, as you will see in the higher classes. 1 2 Now, consider algebraic expressions such as x + > Vx +3and 2 y+ y. Do you x know that you can write x + =x + x!? Here, the exponent of the second term, 1.e., x x 'is 1, which is not a whole number. So, this algebraic expression is not a polynomial. 1 1 Again, Jx +3 can be written as x? +3. Here the exponent of x is 5 which is not a whole number. So, is /x +3 a polynomial? No, it is not. What about aly + y ? It is also not a polynomial (Why?). Reprint 2025-26 POLYNOMIALS 27 If the variable in a polynomial is x, we may denote the polynomial by p(x), or g(x), or r(x), etc. So, for example, we may write : D(x) = 2x? + 5x -3 q(x) = x8 -1 ryyaytytl s(u) =2- u- w + 6u A polynomial can have any (finite) number of terms. For instance, x! + x!? + ... +x?+x+ 1 isa polynomial with 151 terms. Consider the polynomials 2x, 2, 5x?, 5x , y and u*. Do you see that each of these polynomials has only one term? Polynomials having only one term are called monomials ( mono means one ). Now observe each of the following polynomials: P@)=xt1, g@=P-x r= Hl, tuys uw How many terms are there in each of these? Each of these polynomials has only two terms. Polynomials having only two terms are
