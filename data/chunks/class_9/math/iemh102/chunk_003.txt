polynomial in x will be of the form ax + b, where a and 6 are constants and a # 0 (why?). Similarly, ay + bisa linear polynomial in y. Now consider the polynomials : 2x? +5, 5x? + 3x4+ 7, x? and x? + 5% Do you agree that they are all of degree two? A polynomial of degree two is called a quadratic polynomial. Some examples of a quadratic polynomial are 5 y , 4y + 5y and 6 y y . Can you write a quadratic polynomial in one variable with four different terms? You will find that a quadratic polynomial in one variable will have at most 3 terms. If you list a few more quadratic polynomials, you will find that any quadratic polynomial in x is of the form ax? + bx + c, where a # 0 and a, b, c are constants. Similarly, quadratic polynomial in y will be of the form ay + by + c, provided a #0 and a, b, c are constants. We call a polynomial of degree three a cubic polynomial. Some examples of a cubic polynomial in x are 4x3, 2x7 + 1, 5x3 +x, 6x3 x, 6 x3, 2x7 + 49 + 6x + 7. How many terms do you think a cubic polynomial in one variable can have? It can have at most 4 terms. These may be written in the form ax? + bx? + cx + d, where a # 0 and a, b, c and d are constants. Now, that you have seen what a polynomial of degree 1, degree 2, or degree 3 looks like, can you write down a polynomial in one variable of degree n for any natural number 7? A polynomial in one variable x of degree n is an expression of the form ax'+taoxel+...+axta n n-1 1 0 where d,, d,, a,,..., @, are constants and a, # 0. In particular, ifa, = a,=a,=a,=...=a,=0 (all the constants are zero), we get the zero polynomial, which is denoted by 0. What is the degree of the zero polynomial? The degree of the zero polynomial is not defined. So far we have dealt with polynomials in one variable only. We can also have polynomials in more than one variable. For example, x + y? + xyz (where variables are x, y and z) is a polynomial in three variables. Similarly p* + qg' + r (where the variables are p, q andr), u? + v (where the variables are u and v) are polynomials in three and two variables, respectively. You will be studying such polynomials in detail later. Reprint 2025-26 POLYNOMIALS 29 EXERCISE 2.1 1. Which of the following expressions are polynomials in one variable and which are not?
