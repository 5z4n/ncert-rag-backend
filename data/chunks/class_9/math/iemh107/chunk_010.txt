to equal sides in AAPB) It is because these results give us SSA rule which is not always valid or true for congruence of triangles. Also the angle is not included between the equal pairs of sides. ] Let us take some more examples. Example 8 : P is a point equidistant from two lines / and m intersecting at point A (see Fig. 7.38). Show that the line AP bisects the angle between them. Solution : You are given that lines / and m intersect each other at A. Let PB L /, PC L m. It is given that PB = PC. You are to show that Z PAB = Z PAC. Reprint 2025-26 102 MATHEMATICS Let us consider A PAB and A PAC. In these two ] triangles, PB =PC (Given) Z PBA = Z PCA = 90 (Given) PA =PA (Common) So, A PAB = A PAC (RHS rule) Fig. 7.38 So, Z PAB = Z PAC (CPCT) Note that this result is the converse of the result proved in Q.5 of Exercise 7.1. EXERCISE 7.3 1. AABC and A DBC are two isosceles triangles on A the same base BC and vertices A and D are on the same side of BC (see Fig. 7.39). If AD is extended to intersect BC at P, show that (i) AABD=~AACD (ii) AABP=A ACP (iii) AP bisects Z Aas wellas Z D. B P c (iv) AP is the perpendicular bisector of BC. Fig. 7.39 2. AD isan altitude of an isosceles triangle ABC in which AB = AC. Show that (i) AD bisects BC (11) AD bisects Z A. 3. Two sides AB and BC and median AM A P of one triangle ABC are respectively equal to sides PQ and QR and median PN of A PQR (see Fig. 7.40). Show that: (i) AABM=APQN B ck R ii) AABC=APOR @) SW? Fig. 7.40 4. BE and CF are two equal altitudes of a triangle ABC. Using RHS congruence tule, prove that the triangle ABC is isosceles. 5. ABC is an isosceles triangle with AB = AC. Draw AP | BC to show that ZB=ZC. Reprint 2025-26 TRIANGLES 103 7.6 Summary In this chapter, you have studied the following points : 1. 3. 10. 11. 12. Two figures are congruent, if they are of the same shape and of the same size. Two circles of the same radii are congruent. Two squares of the same sides are congruent. If two triangles ABC and PQR are congruent under the correspondence A P, BoQandC oR, then symbolically, it is expressed as A ABC = A PQR. If two sides and the included angle of one triangle are equal to two sides and the included angle of the other triangle, then the two triangles are congruent (SAS Congruence Rule). If two angles and the included side of one triangle are equal to two angles and the included side of the other triangle, then the two triangles are congruent (ASA Congruence
