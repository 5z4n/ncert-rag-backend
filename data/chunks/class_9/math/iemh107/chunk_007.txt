the triangle from the sheet of paper and fold it along AD so that vertex C falls on vertex B. A What can you say about sides AC and AB? Observe that AC covers AB completely So, AC = AB Repeat this activity with some more triangles. VA /\ Each time you will observe that the sides opposite 8 D C to equal angles are equal. So we have the Fig. 7.26 following: Theorem 7.3 : The sides opposite to equal angles of a triangle are equal. This is the converse of Theorem 7.2. You can prove this theorem by ASA congruence rule. Let us take some examples to apply these results. Example 4: In A ABC, the bisector AD of Z A is perpendicular to side BC (see Fig. 7.27). Show that AB = AC and A ABC is isosceles. Solution : In AABD and AACD, ZBAD = Z CAD (Given) o AD = AD (Common) Z ADB = Z ADC = 90 (Given) So, A ABD =A ACD (ASA rule) So, AB = AC (CPCT) or, A ABC is an isosceles triangle. B D Cc Fig. 7.27 Reprint 2025-26 TRIANGLES 97 Example 5: Eand F are respectively the mid-points A of equal sides AB and AC of A ABC (see Fig. 7.28). Show that BF = CE. Solution : In A ABF and A ACE, E F AB= AC (Given) ZA=ZA (Common) AF= AE _ (Halves of equal sides) c So, A ABF = A ACE (SAS rule) Fig. 7.28 Therefore, BF = CE (CPCT) Example 6: In an isosceles triangle ABC with AB = AC, D and E are points on BC such that BE = CD (see Fig. 7.29). Show that AD = AE. Solution : In A ABD and A ACE, AB = AC (Given) (1) A ZB=ZC (Angles opposite to equal sides) (2) Also, BE = CD So, BE - DE= CD - DE Bey EB That is, BD = CE (3) Fig. 7.29 So, A ABD = A ACE (Using (1), (2), (3) and SAS rule). This gives AD=AE (CPCT) EXERCISE 7.2 1. Inan isosceles triangle ABC, with AB = AC, the bisectors of Z B and Z C intersect each other at O. Join A to O. Show that : A (i) OB=OC (11) AO bisects Z A 2. InA ABC, AD is the perpendicular bisector of BC (see Fig. 7.30). Show that A ABC is an isosceles triangle in which AB=AC.
