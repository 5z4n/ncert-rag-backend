92 MATHEMATICS Observe that the triangles may or may not be congruent to each other. So, equality of three angles is not sufficient for congruence of triangles. Therefore, for congruence of triangles out of three equal parts, one has to be a side. Let us now take some more examples. Example 3 : Line-segment AB is parallel to another line-segment CD. O is the mid-point of AD (see Fig. 7.15). Show that (i) AAOB = ADOC (ii) O is also the mid-point of BC. Solution : (@) Consider A AOB and ADOC. D Z ABO= Z DCO (Alternate angles as AB || CD O and BC is the transversal) Z AOB= Z DOC A B (Vertically opposite angles) OA = OD (Given) Fig. 7.15 Therefore, AAOB = ADOC (AAS rule) (ii) OB = OC (CPCT) So, O is the mid-point of BC.

Let us now apply these results to study some properties related to a triangle whose two sides
