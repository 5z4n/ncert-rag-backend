BOC, the other corresponding parts are also equal. So, ZOAD= Z OBC and these form a pair of alternate angles for line segments AD and BC. Therefore, AD || BC. Example 2 : AB is a line segment and line / is its perpendicular bisector. If a point P lies on /, show that P is equidistant from A and B. Solution : Line / L AB and passes through C which is the mid-point of AB (see Fig. 7.9). You have to show that PA = PB. Consider A PCA and A PCB. We have AC=BC_ (Cis the mid-point of AB) Z PCA = Z PCB = 90 (Given) A PC = PC (Common) So, A PCA =A PCB (SAS rule) and so, PA = PB, as they are corresponding sides of congruent triangles. Fig. 7.9 P Now, let us construct two triangles, whose sides are 4 cm and 5 cm and one of the angles is 50 and this angle is not included in between the equal sides (see Fig. 7.10). Are the two triangles congruent? S.cm 5cm (\ Fig. 7.10 Reprint 2025-26 TRIANGLES 89 Notice that the two triangles are not congruent. Repeat this activity with more pairs of triangles. You will observe that for triangles to be congruent, it is very important that the equal angles are included between the pairs of equal sides. So, SAS congruence rule holds but not ASS or SSA rule. Next, try to construct the two triangles in which two angles are 60 and 45 and the side included between these angles is 4 cm (see Fig. 7.11). /\6 45 \ / yor. 45 4cm 4cm Fig.7.11 Cut out these triangles and place one triangle on the other. What do you observe? See that one triangle covers the other completely; that is, the two triangles are congruent. Repeat this activity with more pairs of triangles. You will observe that equality of two angles and the included side is sufficient for congruence of triangles. This result is the Angle-Side-Angle criterion for congruence and is written as ASA criterion. You have verified this criterion in earlier classes, but let us state and prove this result. Since this result can be proved, it is called a theorem and to prove it, we use the SAS axiom for congruence. Theorem 7.1 (ASA congruence rule) : 7wo triangles are congruent if two angles and the included side of one triangle are equal to two angles and the included side of other triangle. Proof : We are given two triangles ABC and DEF in which: B= ZE,ZC=ZF and BC = EF We need to prove that A ABC = A DEF For proving the congruence of the two triangles see that three cases arise. Reprint 2025-26 Case (i) : Let AB = DE (see Fig. 7.12). Now what do you observe? You may observe that AB = DE ZB=ZE BC = EF So, A ABC = A DEF A D J\ Li Fig.7.12 MATHEMATICS (Assumed) (Given) (Given)
