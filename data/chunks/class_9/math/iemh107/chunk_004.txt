given two triangles ABC and DEF in which: B= ZE,ZC=ZF and BC = EF We need to prove that A ABC = A DEF For proving the congruence of the two triangles see that three cases arise. Reprint 2025-26 Case (i) : Let AB = DE (see Fig. 7.12). Now what do you observe? You may observe that AB = DE ZB=ZE BC = EF So, A ABC = A DEF A D J\ Li Fig.7.12 MATHEMATICS (Assumed) (Given) (Given) (By SAS rule) Case (ii) : Let if possible AB > DE. So, we can take a point P on AB such that PB = DE. Now consider A PBC and A DEF (see Fig. 7.13). A D Ba Aa; F Fig. 7.13 Observe that in A PBC and A DEF, PB = DE ZB=ZE BC = EF So, we can conclude that: A PBC = A DEF, by the SAS axiom for congruence. Reprint 2025-26 (By construction) (Given) (Given) TRIANGLES 91 Since the triangles are congruent, their corresponding parts will be equal. So, Z PCB = Z DFE But, we are given that Z ACB = Z DFE So, Z ACB= Z PCB Is this possible? This is possible only if P coincides with A. Or, BA = ED So, A ABC = A DEF (by SAS axiom) Case (iii) : If AB < DE, we can choose a point M on DE such that ME = AB and repeating the arguments as given in Case (ii), we can conclude that AB = DE and so, A ABC = A DEF. Suppose, now in two triangles two pairs of angles and one pair of corresponding sides are equal but the side is not included between the corresponding equal pairs of angles. Are the triangles still congruent? You will observe that they are congruent. Can you reason out why? You know that the sum of the three angles of a triangle is 180 . So if two pairs of angles are equal, the third pair is also equal (180 sum of equal angles). So, two triangles are congruent if any two pairs of angles and one pair of corresponding sides are equal. We may call it as the AAS Congruence Rule. Now let us perform the following activity : Draw triangles with angles 40 , 50 and 90 . How many such triangles can you draw? In fact, you can draw as many triangles as you want with different lengths of sides (see Fig. 7.14). SALA Fig. 7.14 Reprint 2025-26 92 MATHEMATICS Observe that the triangles may or may not be congruent to each other. So, equality of three angles is not sufficient for congruence of triangles. Therefore, for congruence of triangles out of three equal parts, one has to be a side. Let us now take some more examples. Example 3 : Line-segment AB is parallel to another line-segment CD. O is the mid-point of AD (see Fig. 7.15). Show that (i) AAOB = ADOC (ii) O is also
