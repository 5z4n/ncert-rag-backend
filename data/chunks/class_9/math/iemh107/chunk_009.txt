Fig. 7.36). Reprint 2025-26 100 MATHEMATICS Fig. 7.36 Cut them out and place one triangle over the other with equal side placed on each other. Turn the triangles, if necessary. What do you observe? The two triangles cover each other completely and so they are congruent. Repeat this activity with other pairs of right triangles. What do you observe? You will find that two right triangles are congruent if one pair of sides and the hypotenuse are equal. You have verified this in earlier classes. Note that, the right angle is not the included angle in this case. So, you arrive at the following congruence rule: Theorem 7.5 (RHS congruence rule) : /f in two right triangles the hypotenuse and one side of one triangle are equal to the hypotenuse and one side of the other triangle, then the two triangles are congruent. Note that RHS stands for Right angle - Hypotenuse - Side. Let us now take some examples. Example 7 : AB is a line-segment. P and Q are P points on opposite sides of AB such that each of them is equidistant from the points A and B (see Fig. 7.37). Show that the line PQ is the perpendicular bisector A B of AB. Solution ;: You are given that PA = PB and QA = QB and you are to show that PQ 1 AB and PQ bisects AB. Let PQ intersect AB at C. Can you think of two congruent triangles in this figure? Let us take A PAQ and A PBQ. Fig. 7.37 In these triangles, Reprint 2025-26 TRIANGLES 101 AP = BP (Given) AQ = BQ (Given) PQ = PQ (Common) So, A PAQ = A PBQ (SSS rule) Therefore, Z APQ = Z BPQ (CPCT). Now let us consider A PAC and A PBC. You have : AP = BP (Given) Z APC = Z BPC (Z APQ = Z BPQ proved above) PC = PC (Common) So, A PAC = A PBC (SAS rule) Therefore, AC = BC (CPCT) (1) and Z ACP = Z BCP (CPCT) Also, Z ACP + Z BCP = 180 (Linear pair) So, 2Z ACP = 180 Or, Z ACP = 90 (2) From (1) and (2), you can easily conclude that PQ is the perpendicular bisector of AB. [Note that, without showing the congruence of A PAQ and A PBQ, you cannot show that APAC = A PBC even though AP = BP (Given) PC =PC (Common) and Z PAC = Z PBC (Angles opposite to equal sides in AAPB) It is because these results give us SSA rule which is not always valid or true for congruence of triangles. Also the angle is not included between the equal pairs of sides. ] Let us take some more examples. Example 8 : P is a point equidistant from two lines / and m intersecting at point A (see Fig. 7.38). Show that the line AP bisects the angle between them. Solution : You are given
