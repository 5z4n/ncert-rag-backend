conclude that it is a rectangle? Let us examine. We have shown that Z PSR = Z PQR = 90 and Z SPQ = Z SRQ = 90 . So both pairs of opposite angles are equal. Therefore, PQRS is a parallelogram in which one angle (in fact all angles) is 90 and so, PQRS is a rectangle. EXERCISE 8.1 1. Ifthe diagonals of a parallelogram are equal, then show that it is a rectangle. 2. Show that the diagonals of a square are equal and bisect each other at right angles. Diagonal AC of a parallelogram ABCD bisects D C Z A(see Fig. 8.11). Show that (i) it bisects Z C also, (ii) ABCD is arhombus. 4. ABCDisarectangle in which diagonal AC bisects A B Z Aas wellas Z C.

In parallelogram ABCD, two points P and Q are D taken on diagonal BD such that DP = BQ NN (see Fig. 8.12).

ABCD is a parallelogram and AP and CQ are D C perpendiculars from vertices A and C on diagonal BD (see Fig. 8.13). Show that (i) AAPB=ACQD (i) AP=CQ C Fig. 8.12 7.

Now let us study yet another result which is related to the mid-point of sides ofa triangle. Perform the following activity. Draw a triangle and mark the mid-points E and F of two sides of the triangle. Join the points E and F (see Fig. 8.15). Measure EF and BC. Measure Z AEF and Z ABC. A What do you observe? You will find that : EF = > BC and 4 AEF = 2 ABC E F so, EF|| BC Repeat this activity with some more triangles. B C So, you arrive at the following theorem: Fig. 8.15 Reprint 2025-26 112 MATHEMATICS Theorem 8.8 : The line segment joining the mid-points of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side. You can prove this theorem using the following clue: Observe Fig 8.16 in which E and F are mid-points of AB and AC respectively and CD || BA. A AEF = ACDF_ (ASA Rule) So, EF=DF and BE=AE=DC_ (Why?) Therefore, BCDE is a parallelogram. (Why?) This gives EF || BC. 1 1 In this case, also note that EF = 5 ED= > BC. Can you state the converse of Theorem 8.8? Is the converse true? You will see that converse
