From this, we get AB || CD Lo Similarly, BC || AD A B Therefore ABCD is a parallelogram. Fig. 8.5 Let us now take some examples. Example 1 : Show that each angle of a rectangle is a right angle. Solution : Let us recall what a rectangle is. A rectangle is a parallelogram in which one angle is a right angle. Let ABCD be a rectangle in which 7 A = 90 . D C We have to show that Z B= 7 C= Z D=90 We have, AD || BC and AB is a transversal (see Fig. 8.6). So, 2ZA+ZB= 180 (interior angles on the same side of the transversal) Fig. 8.6 But, Z A= 90 So, Z B= 180 Z A= 180 90 = 90 Now, ZC=ZAandZD=2B (Opposite angles of the parallellogram) So, ZC=90 and Z D=90 . Therefore, each of the angles of a rectangle is a right angle. Example 2 : Show that the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular to each other. Solution : Consider the rhombus ABCD (see Fig. 8.7). D C You know that AB = BC = CD = DA (Why?) Now, in A AOD and A COD, OA = OC (Diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other) OD = OD (Common) A B AD = CD Fig. 8.7 xX Reprint 2025-26 108 MATHEMATICS Therefore, A AOD =~ A COD (SSS congruence rule) This gives, Z AOD = Z COD (CPCT) But, Z AOD + Z COD = 180 (Linear pair) So, 2Z AOD = 180 or, Z AOD = 90 So, the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular to each other. Example 3 : ABC is an isosceles triangle in which AB = AC. AD bisects exterior angle PAC and CD || AB (see Fig. 8.8). Show that (7) Z DAC = 2 BCA and_ (ii) ABCD is a parallelogram. Solution : (i) A ABC is isosceles in which AB = AC (Given) So, ZABC= Z ACB (Angles opposite to equal sides) Also, Z PAC = Z ABC+ Z ACB (Exterior angle of a triangle) or, Z PAC = 24 ACB (1) Now, AD bisects Z PAC. So, Z PAC = 24 DAC (2) Therefore, 2Z DAC = 22 ACB [From (1) and (2)] 5 Cc o, ZDAC= ZACB Fig. 8.8 (11) Now, these equal angles form a pair of alternate angles when line segments BC and AD are intersected by a transversal AC. So, BC || AD Also, BA || CD (Given) Now, both pairs of opposite sides of quadrilateral ABCD are parallel. So, ABCD is a parallelogram. Example 4 : Two parallel lines / and m are intersected by a transversal p (see Fig. 8.9). Show that the quadrilateral formed by the bisectors of interior angles is a rectangle. Reprint 2025-26 QUADRILATERALS 109 Solution : It is given that PS || QR and transversal p intersects them at points A and C respectively. The bisectors of Z PAC and 7 ACQ intersect at B and bisectors of
