|| AD and so by Theorem 8.9, E is the mid-point of DF, L.e., DE = EF. In other words, /, m and n cut off equal intercepts on g also. EXERCISE 8.2 D R 1. ABCD isa quadrilateral in which P, Q, R and S are C mid-points of the sides AB, BC, CD and DA (see Fig 8.20). AC is a diagonal. Show that : Ss 0 (i) SR||ACandSR= > AC IXY (ii) PQ=SR P (iii) PQRS isa parallelogram. Fig. 8.20 Reprint 2025-26 MATHEMATICS ABCD is arhombus and P, Q, R and S are the mid-points of the sides AB, BC, CD and DA respectively. Show that the quadrilateral PQRS is a rectangle. ABCD isa rectangle and P, Q, R and S are mid-points of the sides AB, BC, CD and DA respectively. Show that the quadrilateral PQRS is a rhombus. ABCD is a trapezium in which AB || DC, BD is a diagonal and E is the mid-point of AD. A line is drawn through E parallel to AB intersecting BC at F (see Fig. 8.21). Show that F is the mid-point of BC. Fig. 8.21 In a parallelogram ABCD, E and F are the D F Cc mid-points of sides AB and CD respectively \ 7 (see Fig. 8.22). Show that the line segments AF and EC trisect the diagonal BD. Fig. 8.22 ABC isa triangle right angled at C. A line through the mid-point M of hypotenuse AB and parallel to BC intersects AC at D.

AW FY A diagonal ofa parallelogram divides it into two congruent triangles. Ina parallelogram, (i) opposite sides are equal (ii) opposite angles are equal (111) diagonals bisect each other Diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other and are equal and vice-versa. Diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles and vice-versa. Diagonals of a square bisect each other at right angles and are equal, and vice-versa. The line-segment joining the mid-points of any two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and is half of it. A line through the mid-point of a side of a triangle parallel to another side bisects the third side. Reprint 2025-26
