of quadrilateral ABCD are parallel. So, ABCD is a parallelogram. Example 4 : Two parallel lines / and m are intersected by a transversal p (see Fig. 8.9). Show that the quadrilateral formed by the bisectors of interior angles is a rectangle. Reprint 2025-26 QUADRILATERALS 109 Solution : It is given that PS || QR and transversal p intersects them at points A and C respectively. The bisectors of Z PAC and 7 ACQ intersect at B and bisectors of Z ACR and Z SAC intersect at D. We are to show that quadrilateral ABCD is a rectangle. Now, Z PAC = Z ACR (Alternate angles as / || m and p is a transversal) 1 1 So, 74 PAC = > Z ACR i.e., Z BAC = Z ACD These form a pair of alternate angles for lines AB and DC with AC as transversal and they are equal also. Fig. 8-9 So, AB || DC Similarly, BC || AD (Considering Z ACB and Z CAD) Therefore, quadrilateral ABCD is a parallelogram. Also, Z PAC + Z CAS = 180 (Linear pair) So ty PACH ZCAS = ~ = 180 =90 2 2 2 Or, Z BAC + Z CAD = 90 or, Z BAD = 90 So, ABCD is a parallelogram in which one angle is 90 . Therefore, ABCD is a rectangle. Example 5 : Show that the bisectors of angles of a meen form a rectangle. Solution : Let P, Q, R and S be the points of intersection of the bisectors of Z Aand ZB, ZB and ZC, ZC and Z D, and 7 Dand Z A respectively of parallelogram ABCD (see Fig. 8.10). In A ASD, what do you observe? AM Since DS bisects Z D and AS bisects Z A, therefore, Reprint 2025-26 110 MATHEMATICS 1 1 ZDAS+ Z ADS= 5 ZAt 74D a (Z A+ ZD) | ae 5 x 180 (ZAand Z D are interior angles on the same side of the transversal) = 90 Also, Z DAS + Z ADS + Z DSA= 180 (Angle sum property of a triangle) or, 90 + Z DSA = 180 Or, Z DSA = 90 So, Z PSR = 90 (Being vertically opposite to Z DSA) Similarly, it can be shown that Z APB = 90 or Z SPQ = 90 (as it was shown for Z DSA). Similarly, Z PQR = 90 and Z SRQ = 90 . So, PQRS is a quadrilateral in which all angles are right angles. Can we conclude that it is a rectangle? Let us examine. We have shown that Z PSR = Z PQR = 90 and Z SPQ = Z SRQ = 90 . So both pairs of opposite angles are equal. Therefore, PQRS is a parallelogram in which one angle (in fact all angles) is 90 and so, PQRS is a rectangle. EXERCISE 8.1 1. Ifthe diagonals of a parallelogram are equal, then show that it is a rectangle. 2. Show that the diagonals
