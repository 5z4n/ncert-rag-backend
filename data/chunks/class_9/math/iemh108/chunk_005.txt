can prove this theorem using the following clue: Observe Fig 8.16 in which E and F are mid-points of AB and AC respectively and CD || BA. A AEF = ACDF_ (ASA Rule) So, EF=DF and BE=AE=DC_ (Why?) Therefore, BCDE is a parallelogram. (Why?) This gives EF || BC. 1 1 In this case, also note that EF = 5 ED= > BC. Can you state the converse of Theorem 8.8? Is the converse true? You will see that converse of the above theorem is also true which is stated as below: Theorem 8.9 : The line drawn through the mid-point of one side of a triangle, parallel to another side bisects the third side. In Fig 8.17, observe that E is the mid-point of AB, line / is passsing through E and is parallel to BC and CM || BA. Prove that AF = CF by using the congruence of A AEF and A CDF. Example 6 : In A ABC, D, E and F are respectively the mid-points of sides AB, BC and CA (see Fig. 8.18). Show that A ABC is divided into four congruent triangles by joining D, E and F. Solution : As D and E are mid-points of sides AB and BC of the triangle ABC, by Theorem 8.8, B C DE || AC Similarly, DF || BC and EF || AB Fig. 8.18 Reprint 2025-26 QUADRILATERALS 113 Therefore ADEF, BDFE and DFCE are all parallelograms. Now DE is a diagonal of the parallelogram BDFE, therefore, A BDE = A FED Similarly A DAF = A FED and A EFC = A FED So, all the four triangles are congruent. Example 7: J, m and 7 are three parallel lines intersected by transversals p and q such that /, m and n cut off equal intercepts AB and BC on p (see Fig. 8.19). Show that /, m and n cut off equal intercepts DE and EF on q also. Solution : We are given that AB = BC and have to prove that DE = EF. Let us join A to F intersecting m at G.. The trapezium ACED is divided into two triangles; Fig. 8.19 namely A ACF and A AFD. In A ACF, it is given that B is the mid-point of AC (AB = BC) and BG|| CF (since m || 7). So, Gis the mid-point of AF (by using Theorem 8.9) Now, in A AFD, we can apply the same argument as G is the mid-point of AF, GE || AD and so by Theorem 8.9, E is the mid-point of DF, L.e., DE = EF. In other words, /, m and n cut off equal intercepts on g also. EXERCISE 8.2 D R 1. ABCD isa quadrilateral in which P, Q, R and S are C mid-points of the sides AB, BC, CD and DA (see Fig 8.20).
