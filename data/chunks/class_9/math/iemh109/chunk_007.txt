find a peculiar property in such quadrilaterals. Draw several cyclic quadrilaterals of different sides and name each of these B C as ABCD. (This can be done by drawing several circles of different radii and taking four points on each of them.) Measure the opposite angles and write your observations in the following table. S.No. of Quadrilateral ZC ZA+t+ZC}]ZB+ZD What do you infer from the table? Reprint 2025-26 126 MATHEMATICS You find that ZA + ZC = 180 and 7B + ZD = 180 , neglecting the error in measurements. This verifies the following: Theorem 9.10 : The sum of either pair of opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral is 180 . In fact, the converse of this theorem, which is stated below is also true. Theorem 9.11 : If the sum of a pair of opposite angles of a quadrilateral is 180 , the quadrilateral is cyclic. You can see the truth of this theorem by following a method similar to the method adopted for Theorem 9.9. Example 2 : In Fig. 9.19, AB is a diameter of the circle, CD is a chord equal to the radius of the circle. AC and BD when extended intersect at a point E. Prove that Z AEB = 60 . 5 Solution : Join OC, OD and BC. Z\ Triangle ODC is equilateral (Why?) C Therefore, 2 COD = 60 \ 5 I Now, Z CBD = > ZCOD ~~ (Theorem 9.7) nN \ 3 This gives 2 CBD = 30 Again, Z ACB = 90 (Why ?) So, Z BCE = 180 Z ACB = 90 Which gives Z CEB = 90 30 = 60 , i.e., Z AEB = 60 Fig. 9.19 Example 3: In Fig 9.20, ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral in which AC and BD are its diagonals. If Z DBC = 55 and Z BAC = 45 , find Z BCD. D Solution : Z CAD = Z DBC = 55 (Angles in the same segment) Therefore, Z DAB= Z CAD + Z BAC = 55 + 45 = 100 But Z DAB+ Z BCD = 180 (Opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral) So, Z BCD = 180 100 = 80 es] (o) Fig. 9.20 Reprint 2025-26 CIRCLES 127 Example 4 : Two circles intersect at two points A A and B. AD and AC are diameters to the two circles (see Fig. 9.21). Prove that B lies on the line segment D C Solution : Join AB. NUK UY Z ABD = 90 (Angle ina semicircle) Z ABC = 90 (Angle ina semicircle) So, ZABD+ 2 ABC = 90 + 90 = 180 Therefore, DBC is a line. That is B lies on the line segment DC. Example 5 : Prove that the quadrilateral formed (if possible) by the internal angle bisectors of any quadrilateral is cyclic. A D Solution : In Fig. 9.22, ABCD is a quadrilateral in which the angle bisectors AH, BF, CF and DH of internal angles A, B, C and
