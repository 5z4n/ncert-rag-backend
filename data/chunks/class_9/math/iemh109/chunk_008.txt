Example 5 : Prove that the quadrilateral formed (if possible) by the internal angle bisectors of any quadrilateral is cyclic. A D Solution : In Fig. 9.22, ABCD is a quadrilateral in which the angle bisectors AH, BF, CF and DH of internal angles A, B, C and D respectively form a v quadrilateral EFGH. / i Now, Z FEH = Z AEB = 180 Z EAB - Z EBA (Why ?) C B = 180 > (ZA+ ZB) Fig. 9.22 and Z FGH = Z CGD = 180 - Z7GCD- ZGDC._ (Why 2) = 180 - 5 (40+ 2D) 1 1 Therefore, Z FEH + Z FGH = 180 5 (Z A+ ZB) + 180 5 (7C+ ZD) 1 1 = 360 5 ( A+ ZB+ZC+Z D)= 360 5 * 360 = 360 180 = 180 Therefore, by Theorem 9.11, the quadrilateral EFGH is cyclic.

If Z DBC = 70 , Z BAC is 30 , find Z BCD. Further, if AB = BC, find Z ECD. If diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral are diameters of the circle through the vertices of the quadrilateral, prove that it is a rectangle. If the non-parallel sides of a trapezium are equal, prove that it is cyclic. Reprint 2025-26 CIRCLES 129 9. Two circles intersect at two points B and C.
