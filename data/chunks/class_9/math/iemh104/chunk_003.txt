of the equation x + 2y = 6. Solution : By inspection, x = 2, y = 2 is a solution because for x = 2, y = 2 x+2y=2+4=6 Now, let us choose x = 0. With this value of x, the given equation reduces to 2y = 6 which has the unique solution y = 3. So x = 0, y =3 is also a solution of x + 2y = 6. Similarly, taking y = 0, the given equation reduces to x= 6. So, x= 6, y= 0 is a solution of x + 2y = 6 as well. Finally, let us take y = 1. The given equation now reduces to x +2 =6, whose solution is given by x = 4. Therefore, (4, 1) is also a solution of the given equation. So four of the infinitely many solutions of the given equation are: (2,2), (0, 3), (6, 0) and (4, 1). Remark : Note that an easy way of getting a solution is to take x = 0 and get the corresponding value of y. Similarly, we can put vy = 0 and obtain the corresponding value of x. Example 4 : Find two solutions for each of the following equations: (i) 4x+3y=12 (ii) 2x+5y=0 (iii) 3y+4=0 Solution : (1) Taking x = 0, we get 3y = 12, 1.e., y = 4. So, (0, 4) is a solution of the given equation. Similarly, by taking y= 0, we get x = 3. Thus, (3, 0) is also a solution.

Now, if you take y = 0, you again get (0, 0) as a solution, which is the same as the earlier one. To get another solution, take x = 1, say. Then you can check that the corresponding value of y is _ So f. - 2) is another solution of 2x + 5y=0. (111) Writing the equation 3y + 4 = 0 as 0.x + 3y + 4 = 0, you will find that y = 3 for any value of x. Thus, two solutions can be given as [o, - *) and [1 -2) . EXERCISE 4.2 1.
