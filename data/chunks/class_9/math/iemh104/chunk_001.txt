7, mu + 5v=9 and 3 = V2 x Ty. Note that you can put these equations in the form 1.25 + 3t- 5 = 0, pt+4q 7=0, mu + 5v 9=0 and J2 x Ty 3 =0, respectively. So, any equation which can be put in the form ax + by + c= 0, where a, b and c are real numbers, and a and b are not both zero, is called a /inear equation in two variables. This means that you can think of many many such equations. Example 1 : Write each of the following equations in the form ax + by + c= 0 and indicate the values of a, b and c in each case: (i) 2x+3y=4.37 (ii)x-4= /3y = (iii) 4=S5x-3y (iv) 2x = Solution : (4) 2x + 3y = 4.37 can be written as 2x + 3y 4.37 = 0. Here a= 2, b=3 and c = 4.37. (ii) The equation x 4 = /3 y can be written as x /3 y- 4 = 0. Here a= 1, b= J3 andc= 4. (iti) The equation 4 = 5x 3y can be written as 5x 3y -4 = 0. Herea=5, b=-3 and c = 4. Do you agree that it can also be written as 5x + 3y + 4 = 0 ? In this case a= 5,b=3 andc=4. Reprint 2025-26 LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES 57 (iv) The equation 2x = y can be written as 2x y + 0 = 0. Here a= 2, b =-1 and c=0. Equations of the type ax + b= 0 are also examples of linear equations in two variables because they can be expressed as ax + 0.y+b=0 For example, 4 3x = 0 can be written as -3x + 0.y+4=0. Example 2 : Write each of the following as an equation in two variables: (i) x = 5 (ii) y=2 (iii) 2x = 3 (iv) 5y=2 Solution : (4) x = 5 can be written as 1.x + 0.y = 5, or l.x+0.y+5=0. (11) y = 2 can be written as 0.x + l.y=2, or Ox+ 1l.y 2=0. (iii) 2x = 3 can be written as 2x + 0.y 3 =0. (iv) S5y = 2 can be written as 0.x + 5y 2 =0. EXERCISE 4.1 1. The cost of a notebook is twice the cost of a pen. Write a linear equation in two variables to represent this statement. (Take the cost of a notebook to be % x and that of a pen to be @ y). 2. Express the following linear equations in the form ax + by + c = 0 and indicate the values of a, b and c in each case: (i) 2x+3y= 9.35 (i) x = 10=0 (iii) 2x + 3y =6 (iv) x=3y (v) 2x= Sy (vi) 3x +2=0 (vii) y-2=0 (vii) 5=2x 4.3 Solution of a Linear Equation You have seen that every linear equation in one variable has a unique solution.
