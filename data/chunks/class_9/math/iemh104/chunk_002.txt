a pen to be @ y). 2. Express the following linear equations in the form ax + by + c = 0 and indicate the values of a, b and c in each case: (i) 2x+3y= 9.35 (i) x = 10=0 (iii) 2x + 3y =6 (iv) x=3y (v) 2x= Sy (vi) 3x +2=0 (vii) y-2=0 (vii) 5=2x 4.3 Solution of a Linear Equation You have seen that every linear equation in one variable has a unique solution. What can you say about the solution of a linear equation involving two variables? As there are two variables in the equation, a solution means a pair of values, one for x and one for y which satisfy the given equation. Let us consider the equation 2x + 3y = 12. Here, x = 3 andy = 2 is a solution because when you substitute x = 3 and y = 2 in the equation above, you find that 2x + 3y = (2 x 3)+(3 x 2)= 12 This solution is written as an ordered pair (3, 2), first writing the value for x and then the value for y. Similarly, (0, 4) is also a solution for the equation above. Reprint 2025-26 58 MATHEMATICS On the other hand, (1, 4) is not a solution of 2x + 3y = 12, because on putting x= 1 and y=4 we get 2x + 3y= 14, which is not 12. Note that (0, 4) is a solution but not (4, 0). You have seen at least two solutions for 2x + 3y = 12, 1.e., (3, 2) and (0, 4). Can you find any other solution? Do you agree that (6, 0) is another solution? Verify the same. In fact, we can get many many solutions in the following way. Pick a value of your choice for x (say x = 2) in 2x + 3y = 12. Then the equation reduces to 4 + 3y = 12, which is a linear equation in one variable. On solving this, you get y= 3 So | 2, 8 is another solution of 2x + 3y= 12. Similarly, choosing x = 5, you find that the equation becomes 10 + 3y = 12. This gives y = 3 So, | 5, 2) is another solution of 2x + 3y = 12. So there is no end to different solutions of a linear equation in two variables. That is, a linear equation in two variables has infinitely many solutions. Example 3 : Find four different solutions of the equation x + 2y = 6. Solution : By inspection, x = 2, y = 2 is a solution because for x = 2, y = 2 x+2y=2+4=6 Now, let us choose x = 0. With this value of x, the given equation reduces to 2y = 6 which has the unique solution y = 3. So x = 0, y =3 is also a solution of x + 2y = 6. Similarly, taking y = 0, the
