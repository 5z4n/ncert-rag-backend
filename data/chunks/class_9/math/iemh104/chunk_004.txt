Anequation of the form ax + by + c=0, where a, b and c are real numbers, such that a and b are not both zero, is called a linear equation in two variables. 2. A linear equation in two variables has infinitely many solutions. 3. Every point on the graph of a linear equation in two variables is a solution of the linear equation. Moreover, every solution of the linear equation is a point on the graph of the linear equation. Reprint 2025-26
