Edmund Halley 4.1 Introduction In earlier classes, you have studied linear equations in one variable. Can you write down a linear equation in one variable? You may say that x + 1=0,x+ /2 =0 and V2 yt V3 =Oare examples of linear equations in one variable. You also know that such equations have a unique (i.e., one and only one) solution. You may also remember how to represent the solution on a number line. In this chapter, the knowledge of linear equations in one variable shall be recalled and extended to that of two variables. You will be considering questions like: Does a linear equation in two variables have a solution? If yes, is it unique? What does the solution look like on the Cartesian plane? You shall also use the concepts you studied in Chapter 3 to answer these questions. 4.2 Linear Equations Let us first recall what you have studied so far. Consider the following equation: 2x+5=0 Its solution, i.e., the root of the equation, is > . This can be represented on the number line as shown below: 2 Root Fig. 4.1 Reprint 2025-26 56 MATHEMATICS While solving an equation, you must always keep the following points in mind: The solution of a linear equation is not affected when: (i) the same number is added to (or subtracted from) both the sides of the equation. (ii) you multiply or divide both the sides of the equation by the same non-zero number. Let us now consider the following situation: In a One-day International Cricket match between India and Sri Lanka played in Nagpur, two Indian batsmen together scored 176 runs. Express this information in the form of an equation. Here, you can see that the score of neither of them is known, i.e., there are two unknown quantities. Let us use x and y to denote them. So, the number of runs scored by one of the batsmen is x, and the number of runs scored by the other is y. We know that x+y= 176, which is the required equation. This is an example of a linear equation in two variables. It is customary to denote the variables in such equations by x and y, but other letters may also be used. Some examples of linear equations in two variables are: 1.2s+ 3t=5,p+4q= 7, mu + 5v=9 and 3 = V2 x Ty. Note that you can put these equations in the form 1.25 + 3t- 5 = 0, pt+4q 7=0, mu + 5v 9=0 and J2 x Ty 3 =0, respectively. So, any equation which can be put in the form ax + by + c= 0, where a, b and c are real numbers, and a and b are not both zero, is called a /inear equation in two variables. This
