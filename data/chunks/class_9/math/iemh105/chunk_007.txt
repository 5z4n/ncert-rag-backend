AC= 5 AB. Explain by drawing the figure. 5. In Question 4, point C is called a mid-point of line segment AB. Prove that every line segment has one and only one mid-point. 6. InFig.5.10,ifAC=BD, then prove that AB =CD. B D A C Fig. 5.10 7. Why is Axiom 5S, in the list of Euclid s axioms, considered a universal truth ? (Note that the question is not about the fifth postulate.) 5.3 Summary In this chapter, you have studied the following points: 1. Though Euclid defined a point, a line, and a plane, the definitions are not accepted by mathematicians. Therefore, these terms are now taken as undefined. Axioms or postulates are the assumptions which are obvious universal truths. They are not proved. Theorems are statements which are proved, using definitions, axioms, previously proved statements and deductive reasoning. Some of Euclid s axioms were : (1) Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another. (2) If equals are added to equals, the wholes are equal. (3) Ifequals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal. (4) Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another. (5) The whole is greater than the part. (6) Things which are double of the same things are equal to one another. (7) Things which are halves of the same things are equal to one another. Euclid s postulates were : Postulate 1 : A straight line may be drawn from any one point to any other point. Postulate 2 : A terminated line can be produced indefinitely. Postulate 3 : A circle can be drawn with any centre and any radius. Postulate 4: All right angles are equal to one another. Reprint 2025-26
