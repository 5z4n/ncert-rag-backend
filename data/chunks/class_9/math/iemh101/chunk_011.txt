now extend the idea of square roots to cube roots, fourth roots, and in general nth roots, where n is a positive integer. Recall your understanding of square roots and cube roots from earlier classes. What is 3/g ? Well, we know it has to be some positive number whose cube is 8, and you must have guessed 3/8 =2. Let us try $/243 . Do you know some number b such that b = 243? The answer is 3. Therefore, 3/243 = 3. From these examples, can you define %/q for a real number a > 0 and a positive integer n? Let a > 0 be a real number and 7 be a positive integer. Then 2/q = 5, if b" =a and b> 0. Note that the symbol / used in J/2, 3/8, #/a, etc. is called the radical sign. We now list some identities relating to square roots, which are useful in various ways. You are already familiar with some of these from your earlier classes. The remaining ones follow from the distributive law of multiplication over addition of real numbers, and from the identity (x + y) (x y) =x y , for any real numbers x and y. Let a and b be positive real numbers. Then (i) Jab = Jab w f= (ii) (Va + Vb) (Va =b)=a-b Gv) (a+ Vb) (a-vb)=a?-b (v) (Va + Vb) (ve + Jd) = Vac + Jad + Jbe + bd (i) (Va + Vb) =a +2Vab +0 Let us look at some particular cases of these identities. Example 15: Simplify the following expressions: (i) (5+ V7) (2+ v5) (i) (5+ V5) (5- v5) Gi) (V3 + V7) (iv) (Vit - V7) (vit + V7) Reprint 2025-26 Numer SYSTEMS 19 Solution : (i) (5+ V7) (2+ V5) =10 + S 5 + 2V7 + V35 (i) (5+ V5) (5 - V5) =5? -(V5) =25-5 =20 Git) (V3+V7) =(V3) + 2V8V7+(V7) =3+2V21+7=10+ 221 (iv) (vit - V7) (Vil + V7) = (vit) -(V7) =11-7=4 Remark : Note that simplify in the example above has been used to mean that the expression should be written as the sum of a rational and an irrational number. We end this section by considering the following problem. Look at yo Can you tell where it shows up on the number line? You know that it is irrational. May be it is easier to handle if the denominator is a rational number. Let us see, if we can rationalise the denominator, that is, to make the denominator into a rational number. To do so, we need the identities involving square roots. Let us see how. Example 16 : Rationalise the denominator of Woe Solution : We want to write Wel as an equivalent expression in which the denominator is arational number. We know that ./2 ./2 is rational. We also know that multiplying == b v2 ill giv ivalent 1 1 v2 is h , . SO, tt t 2 y a will
