Anumber ris called a rational number, if it can be written in the form 7 , where p and q are integers and g #0. 2. Anumber s is called a irrational number, if it cannot be written in the form 7 , where p and q are integers and q # 0. 3. The decimal expansion ofa rational number is either terminating or non-terminating recurring. Moreover, a number whose decimal expansion is terminating or non-terminating recurring is rational. 4. The decimal expansion of an irrational number is non-terminating non-recurring. Moreover, a number whose decimal expansion is non-terminating non-recurring is irrational. 5. All the rational and irrational numbers make up the collection of real numbers. r 6. Ifris rational and s is irrational, then +s andr s are irrational numbers, and rs and are irrational numbers, r + 0. 7. For positive real numbers a and d, the following identities hold: | laa () Jab =Javb Oe aaa (iii) (Va + Vb) (Va - Vb) =a-b (iv) (a + Vb) (a -Vb)=a -b (v) (Ja +b) =a + 2Jab +b Va -b Va -b where a and b are 8. To rationalise the denominator of > we multiply this by Ja +b integers. 9. Let a>0 bea real number and p and g be rational numbers. Then (i) a.at=ar*4 (it) (a )!= ar (ii) =a !
