The remainder never becomes zero In the examples of 3 and ze we notice that the remainders repeat after a certain stage forcing the decimal expansion to go on for ever. In other words, we have a repeating block of digits in the quotient. We say that this expansion is non-terminating 10 1 recurring. For example, 3 3.3333... and 7 0.142857142857142857... 10 The usual way of showing that 3 repeats in the quotient of 3 is to write it as 33. 1 1 Similarly, since the block of digits 142857 repeats in the quotient of 7z>we write 7 as 0.142857 , where the bar above the digits indicates the block of digits that repeats. Also 3.57272... can be written as 3.572 . So, all these examples give us non-terminating recurring (repeating) decimal expansions. Thus, we see that the decimal expansion of rational numbers have only two choices: either they are terminating or non-terminating recurring. Now suppose, on the other hand, on your walk on the number line, you come across a number like 3.142678 whose decimal expansion is terminating or a number like 1.272727... that is, 1.27 , whose decimal expansion 1s non-terminating recurring, can you conclude that it is a rational number? The answer is yes! Reprint 2025-26 NUMBER SYSTEMS 11 We will not prove it but illustrate this fact with a few examples. The terminating cases are easy. Example 6 : Show that 3.142678 is a rational number. In other words, express 3.142678 in the form a where p and q are integers and q # 0. Solution : We have 3.142678 = 3142678 > and hence is a rational number. Now, let us consider the case when the decimal expansion is non-terminating recurring. Example 7 : Show that 0.3333... = 0.3 can be expressed in the form , where p and q are integers and q # 0. Solution : Since we do not know what 03 is , let us call it x and so x = 0.3333... Now here is where the trick comes in. Look at 10x = 10 x (0.333...) = 3.333... Now, 3.3333...= 3+ x, since x = 0.3333... Therefore, 10x=3+x Solving for x, we get ; 1 9x = 3,1. .,x= 3 Example 8 : Show that 1.272727... = 1.27 can be expressed in the form a , where p and g are integers and q # 0. Solution : Let x = 1.272727... Since two digits are repeating, we multiply x by 100 to get 100 x = 127.2727... So, 100 x = 126+ 1.272727...= 126+ x Therefore, 100 x -x = 126, ie., 99x=126 Reprint 2025-26 12 MATHEMATICS 126 14 1. ., x= 09 Old 14 __ You can check the reverse that 1 = 1.27. Example 9 : Show that 0.2353535... = 0.235 can be expressed in the form a where p and q are integers and q # 0. Solution : Let x = 0.235. Over here, note that 2 does not repeat, but the block 35
