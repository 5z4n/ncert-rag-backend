rational numbers also include the natural numbers, whole numbers and integers. You also know that the rational numbers do not have a unique representation in P wh d int dg#0.F | Piz _W a ere p and q are integers and q # 0. For example, 7 4.20 50 the form = 94 and so on. These are equivalent rational numbers (or fractions). However, when we say that 2 is a rational number, or when we represent P on the number y q p q line, we assume that g # 0 and that p and q have no common factors other than 1 (that is, p and g are co-prime). So, on the number line, among the infinitely many 1 1 fractions equivalent to awe will choose 5 to represent all of them. Now, let us solve some examples about the different types of numbers, which you have studied in earlier classes. Example 1 : Are the following statements true or false? Give reasons for your answers. (i) Every whole number is a natural number. (ii) Every integer is a rational number. (iti) Every rational number is an integer. Solution : (i) False, because zero is a whole number but not a natural number. m (ii) True, because every integer m can be expressed in the form T and so it is a rational number. Reprint 2025-26 4 MATHEMATICS (itt) False, because 5 is not an integer. Example 2 : Find five rational numbers between 1 and 2. We can approach this problem in at least two ways. Solution 1 : Recall that to find a rational number between r and s, you can add r and +S r 3 s and divide the sum by 2, that is lies between r and s. So, 5 is a number between | and 2. You can proceed in this manner to find four more rational numbers 1 13 7 between | and 2. These four numbers are and 48 8 4 Solution 2 : The other option is to find all the five rational numbers in one step. Since we want five numbers, we write | and 2 as rational numbers with denominator 5 + 1, 8 9 10 11 6 66? 6 and 6 are all rational 7 43 55 1] >=> , and , 6 3 2 3 6 Remark : Notice that in Example 2, you were asked to find five rational numbers between | and 2. But, you must have realised that in fact there are infinitely many rational numbers between | and 2. In general, there are infinitely many rational numbers between any two given rational numbers. 6 12 ie., 1= 6 and 2 = 6" Then you can check that numbers between | and 2. So, the five numbers are Let us take a look at the number line again. Have you picked up all the numbers? Not, yet. The fact is that there are infinitely many more numbers left on the number line!
