As far as your eyes can see, there are numbers, numbers and numbers! 3 2 = 6 n] Fig. 1.2 Now suppose you start walking along the number line, and collecting some of the numbers. Get a bag ready to store them! Reprint 2025-26 2 MATHEMATICS You might begin with picking up only natural numbers like 1,2, 3, and so on. You know that this list goes on for ever. (Why is this true?) So, now your bag contains infinitely many natural numbers! Recall that we denote this collection by the symbol N. Now turn and walk all the way back, pick up zero and put it into the bag. You now have the collection of whole numbers which is denoted by the symbol W. Now, stretching in front of you are many, many negative integers. Put all the negative integers into your bag. What is your new collection? Recall that it is the collection of all integers, and it is denoted by the symbol Z. Z comes from the German word zahlen , which means | @~ to count . Are there some numbers still left on the line? Of course! There are numbers like 13 ~2005 24 OSV 5006 . If you put all such numbers also into the bag, it will now be the ~ 2 98 Xe G. A o OL Reprint 2025-26 NUMBER SYSTEMS 3 collection of rational numbers. The collection of rational numbers is denoted by Q. Rational comes from the word ratio , and Q comes from the word quotient . You may recall the definition of rational numbers: A number 7 is called a rational number, if it can be written in the form : where p and q are integers and gq # 0. (Why do we insist that g # 0?) Notice that all the numbers now in the bag can be written in the form a , where p . ; 25 and q are integers and q # 0. For example, 25 can be written as 7 ? here p = 25 and g = 1. Therefore, the rational numbers also include the natural numbers, whole numbers and integers. You also know that the rational numbers do not have a unique representation in P wh d int dg#0.F | Piz _W a ere p and q are integers and q # 0. For example, 7 4.20 50 the form = 94 and so on. These are equivalent rational numbers (or fractions). However, when we say that 2 is a rational number, or when we represent P on the
