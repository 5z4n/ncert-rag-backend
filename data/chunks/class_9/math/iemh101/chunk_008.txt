The history of the hunt for digits in the decimal expansion of 7 is very interesting. The Greek genius Archimedes was the first to compute digits in the decimal expansion of 7. He showed 3.140845 <m < 3.142857. Aryabhatta (476 550 C.E.), the great Indian mathematician and astronomer, found the value of x correct to four decimal places (3.1416). Using high speed computers and advanced algorithms, m has been computed to over 1.24 trillion decimal places! Archimedes (287 BCE 212 BCE) Fig. 1.10 Now, let us see how to obtain irrational numbers. 1 Example 10: Find an irrational number between 7 and 7: 1 ____ 2 a Solution : We saw that 7 0.142857 . So, you can easily calculate 5 = 0.285714. 1 2 To find an irrational number between 7 and 7 we find a number which is Reprint 2025-26 14 MATHEMATICS non-terminating non-recurring lying between them. Of course, you can find infinitely many such numbers. An example of such a number is 0.150150015000150000... EXERCISE 1.3 1. Write the following in decimal form and say what kind of decimal expansion each has : 36 i a. al (i) 100 (ii) 7 (iii) 8 2 2 , 329 5 iT ) Zo0 loo e , ; 2 3 2. You know that 77 0.142857 . Can you predict what the decimal expansions of 77> 4 5 777 7 ae, without actually doing the long division? If so, how? [Hint : Study the remainders while finding the value of 7 carefully. | 3. Express the following in the form 7 , where p and qg are integers and g #0. @) 06 (ii) 0.47 (iii) 0.001 4. Express 0.99999 .... in the form ?.. Are you surprised by your answer? With your q teacher and classmates discuss why the answer makes sense. 5. What can the maximum number of digits be in the repeating block of digits in the decimal expansion of 7 ? Perform the division to check your answer. 6. Look at several examples of rational numbers in the form P (q #0), where p and q are integers with no common factors other than | and having terminating decimal representations (expansions). Can you guess what property g must satisfy? 7. Write three numbers whose decimal expansions are non-terminating non-recurring. 5 9 8. Find three different irrational numbers between the rational numbers 7 and 1 . 9. Classify the following numbers as rational or irrational : (i) 23 (ut) 4225 (iti) 0.3796 (iv) 7.478478...

Reprint 2025-26 NUMBER SYSTEMS 15 1.4 Operations on Real Numbers You have learnt, in earlier classes, that rational numbers satisfy the commutative, associative and distributive laws for addition and multiplication. Moreover, if we add, subtract, multiply or divide (except by zero) two rational numbers, we still get a rational number (that is, rational numbers
