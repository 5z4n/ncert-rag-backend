attention to the operation of taking square roots of real numbers. Recall that, if a is a natural number, then a = b means b?= a and b > 0. The same definition can be extended for positive real numbers. Let a > 0 be a real number. Then J/g =b means b? = a and b> 0. In Section 1.2, we saw how to represent ./n for any positive integer n on the number line. We now show how to find ./x for any given positive real number x geometrically. For example, let us find it for x = 3.5, i.e., we find 3.5 geometrically. D A< 3.5 >B 1 C Fig. 1.11 Mark the distance 3.5 units from a fixed point A on a given line to obtain a point B such that AB = 3.5 units (see Fig. 1.11). From B, mark a distance of 1 unit and mark the new point as C. Find the mid-point of AC and mark that point as O. Draw a semicircle with centre O and radius OC. Draw a line perpendicular to AC passing through B and intersecting the semicircle at D. Then, BD = V3.5.

Then, as we have done for the case x = 3.5, we find BD = Vx (see Fig. 1.12). We can prove this result using the A< x >B 1 C Pythagoras Theorem. Fig. 1.12 Notice that, in Fig. 1.12, AOBD is a right-angled triangle. Also, the radius of the circle x+1 iS units. x+1l ss. Therefore, OC = OD = OA = 5 units. x+1 x-1 =x = . Now, OB 5 5 So, by the Pythagoras Theorem, we have x+1/ x-1Y 4x BD? = OD? OB? = 5 = _=x, This shows that BD = ./x . This construction gives us a visual, and geometric way of showing that ./x exists for all real numbers x > 0. If you want to know the position of ./x on the number line, then let us treat the line BC as the number line, with B as zero, C as 1, and so on. Draw an arc with centre B and radius BD, which intersects the number line in E (see Fig. 1.13). Then, E represents Vx. Reprint 2025-26 18 MATHEMATICS We would like to now extend the idea of square roots to cube roots, fourth roots, and in general nth roots, where n is a positive integer. Recall your understanding of square roots and cube roots from earlier classes. What is 3/g ? Well, we know it has to be some positive number whose cube is 8, and you must have guessed 3/8 =2. Let us try $/243 . Do you know some number b such that b = 243? The answer is 3.
