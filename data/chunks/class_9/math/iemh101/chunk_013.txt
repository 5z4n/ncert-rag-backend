Did you get these answers? They are as follows: (i) 177.177 =17' (ii) (5 ) = 5" (iii) = = 23 (iv) 73. 9 = 633 To get these answers, you would have used the following laws of exponents, which you have learnt in your earlier classes. (Here a, m and m are natural numbers. Remember, a is called the base and m and n are the exponents.) (1) a . qa" =a +n (ii) (a )" = qm (ii) ; =a""",m>n (iv) ab" = (ab) n Reprint 2025-26 22 MATHEMATICS What is (a)"? Yes, it is 1! So you have learnt that (a) = 1. So, using (iii), we can get =a". We can now extend the laws to negative exponents too. a So, for example : (i) 17 -17 =17?= 7 (ii) (5 )? =5" (ii) Sar = 23" (iv) (17-9)? = (63) Suppose we want to do the following computations: 2 1 1\4 (i) 23.23 (ii) "| 5 1 ot (iil) (iv) 13> -17 3B How would we go about it? It turns out that we can extend the laws of exponents that we have studied earlier, even when the base is a positive real number and the exponents are rational numbers. (Later you will study that it can further to be extended when the exponents are real numbers.) But before we state these laws, and to even make sense of these laws, we need to first understand what, for example 42 is. So, we have some work to do! We define #/q fora real number a> 0 as follows: Let a > 0 be a real number and 7a positive integer. Then %/q = b, if b"= a and b>0. I I In the language of exponents, we define %/q = @ . So, in particular, 3/2 = 23. There are now two ways to look at 47. Reprint 2025-26 NUMBER SYSTEMS 23 Therefore, we have the following definition: Let a> 0 be a real number. Let m and n be integers such that m and n have no common factors other than 1, and n > 0. Then, We now have the following extended laws of exponents: Let a> 0 be a real number and p and q be rational numbers. Then, we have (i) a. alt= ar (ii) (a?)! = ard a? (iii) a a -4 (iv) a b? = (aby You can now use these laws to answer the questions asked earlier. 2 1 1\4 Example 20 : Simplify (i) 23 - 23 (ii) "| 5 1 1 (iii) (iv) 135 -175 Solution : 7 2 1 (2-4) 3 iyi 4 75 iol 3-5 -2 1 1 1 1 _ Als 3 (ii) -=7 =7 5 =715 (iv) 135 -175 =(13 x 17)5 = 2215 zB EXERCISE 1.5 1 1 1 1.
