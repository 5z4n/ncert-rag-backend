We will look at the decimal expansions of real numbers and see if we can use the expansions to distinguish between rationals and irrationals. We will also explain how to visualise the representation of real numbers on the number line using their decimal expansions. Since rationals are more familiar to us, let us start with 10 7 them. Let us take three examples : 37a 7: Pay special attention to the remainders and see if you can find any pattern.

Remainders : 6, 4, 0 Remainders : 3, 2, 6,4, 5, 1, Divisor : 3 Divisor: 8 3, 2,6, 4, 5, 1... Divisor : 7 What have you noticed? You should have noticed at least three things: (i) Theremainders either become 0 after a certain stage, or start repeating themselves. (ii) The number of entries in the repeating string of remainders is less than the divisor (in 3 one number repeats itself and the divisor is 3, in 7 there are six entries 326451 in the repeating string of remainders and 7 is the divisor). (iit) Ifthe remainders repeat, then we get a repeating block of digits in the quotient 10 1 (for 3 3 repeats in the quotient and for z>we get the repeating block 142857 in the quotient). Reprint 2025-26 10 MATHEMATICS Although we have noticed this pattern using only the examples above, it is true for all rationals of the form a (q #0). On division of p by qg, two main things happen either the remainder becomes zero or never becomes zero and we get a repeating string of remainders. Let us look at each case separately. Case (i) : The remainder becomes zero In the example of gore found that the remainder becomes zero after some steps and 7 1 the decimal expansion of ra 0.875. Other examples are 5 0.5, 750 > 2.556. In all these cases, the decimal expansion terminates or ends after a finite number of steps. We call the decimal expansion of such numbers terminating. Case (ii) : The remainder never becomes zero In the examples of 3 and ze we notice that the remainders repeat after a certain stage forcing the decimal expansion to go on for ever. In other words, we have a repeating block of digits in the quotient. We say that this expansion is non-terminating 10 1 recurring. For example, 3 3.3333... and 7 0.142857142857142857... 10 The usual way of showing that 3 repeats in the quotient of 3 is to write it as
