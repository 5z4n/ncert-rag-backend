100 x = 126+ 1.272727...= 126+ x Therefore, 100 x -x = 126, ie., 99x=126 Reprint 2025-26 12 MATHEMATICS 126 14 1. ., x= 09 Old 14 __ You can check the reverse that 1 = 1.27. Example 9 : Show that 0.2353535... = 0.235 can be expressed in the form a where p and q are integers and q # 0. Solution : Let x = 0.235. Over here, note that 2 does not repeat, but the block 35 repeats. Since two digits are repeating, we multiply x by 100 to get 100 x = 23.53535... So, 100 x = 23.3 + 0.23535... = 23.3 +x Therefore, 99 x= 23.3 L.e., x= 10 which gives x = 990 233 ws You can also check the reverse that 990 = 0.235. So, every number with a non-terminating recurring decimal expansion can be expressed in the form 2 (q #0), where p and q are integers. Let us summarise our results in the q following form : The decimal expansion of a rational number is either terminating or nonterminating recurring. Moreover, a number whose decimal expansion is terminating or non-terminating recurring is rational. So, now we know what the decimal expansion of a rational number can be. What about the decimal expansion of irrational numbers? Because of the property above, we can conclude that their decimal expansions are non-terminating non-recurring. So, the property for irrational numbers, similar to the property stated above for rational numbers, is The decimal expansion of an irrational number is non-terminating non-recurring. Moreover, a number whose decimal expansion is non-terminating non-recurring is irrational. Reprint 2025-26 NUMBER SYSTEMS 13 Recall s = 0.10110111011110... from the previous section. Notice that it is nonterminating and non-recurring. Therefore, from the property above, it is irrational. Moreover, notice that you can generate infinitely many irrationals similar to s. What about the famous irrationals ./7 and x? Here are their decimal expansions up to a certain stage. J2 =1.41421356237309504880 16887242096... tT =3.14159265358979323846264338327950... (Note that, we often take 7 asan approximate value for 7, but 7 # 7 .) Over the years, mathematicians have developed various techniques to produce more and more digits in the decimal expansions of irrational numbers. For example, you might have learnt to find digits in the decimal expansion of ,/2 by the division method. Interestingly, in the Sulbasutras (rules of chord), a mathematical treatise of the Vedic period (800 BC - 500 BC), you find an approximation of ,/2 as follows: 1 1 1 1 1.1 =|]1+ +]-x x x |=1.4142156 v2 3 [ 4 3 [ 34 4 3 Notice that it is the same as the one given above for the first five decimal places. The history of the hunt for digits in the decimal expansion of 7 is very interesting. The Greek genius Archimedes was the first to compute digits in the decimal expansion of 7. He showed 3.140845 <m < 3.142857. Aryabhatta (476 550 C.E.), the great Indian mathematician and astronomer, found the value of
