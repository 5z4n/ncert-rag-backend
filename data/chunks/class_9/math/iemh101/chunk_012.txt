to make the denominator into a rational number. To do so, we need the identities involving square roots. Let us see how. Example 16 : Rationalise the denominator of Woe Solution : We want to write Wel as an equivalent expression in which the denominator is arational number. We know that ./2 ./2 is rational. We also know that multiplying == b v2 ill giv ivalent 1 1 v2 is h , . SO, tt t 2 y a will give us an equivalent expression, since 5 0, we put these two facts together to get 11 v2_ 42 V2 V2 v2 2 In this form, it is easy to locate V2 on the number line. It is half way between 0 and V2. Reprint 2025-26 20 MATHEMATICS Example 17 : Rationalise the denominator of 2+ 3 Solution : We use the Identity (iv) given earlier. Multiply and divide 2+ 3 by 2-13 to get 5 F < 3. 2-3-9 V3. Example 18 : Rationalise the denominator of 3 - Vs Solution : Here we use the Identity (iii) given earlier. 5 53+ V5 _ 5(VB +5) (5 So) B-V5 B_ Js a+J5. 3-5 =($) (3 +3) 7432. 1 [Tne Tt Example 19 : Rationalise the denominator of Solution : x x = 74+3J/2 74+3J2 |7-3V2] 49-18 31 So, when the denominator of an expression contains a term with a square root (or anumber under a radical sign), the process of converting it to an equivalent expression whose denominator is a rational number is called rationalising the denominator. EXERCISE 1.4 1. Classify the following numbers as rational or irrational: 2V7 () 2-1/5 (iy (3 + 123) - 23 (i) TF (iv) V2 (v) 2a Reprint 2025-26 NUMBER SYSTEMS 21 2. Simplify each of the following expressions: (i) (3 + V3) (2+ v2) (ii) (3 + V3) (3 - v3) (ii) (V5 + V2) tv) (V5 -v2) (V5 + V2) 3. Recall, 2 is defined as the ratio of the circumference (say c) of a circle to its diameter c (say d). That is, 7 = Zz This seems to contradict the fact that x is irrational. How will you resolve this contradiction? 4. Represent V9.3 on the number line. 5. Rationalise the denominators of the following: . 1 oe 1 OF @) 7-6 | <>.

They are as follows: (i) 177.177 =17' (ii) (5 ) = 5" (iii) = = 23 (iv) 73. 9 = 633 To get these answers, you would have used the following laws of exponents, which you have learnt in your earlier classes. (Here a, m and m are natural numbers. Remember, a is called the base and m and n are the exponents.) (1) a . qa" =a +n (ii) (a )" = qm (ii)
