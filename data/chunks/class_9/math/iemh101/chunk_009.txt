Reprint 2025-26 NUMBER SYSTEMS 15 1.4 Operations on Real Numbers You have learnt, in earlier classes, that rational numbers satisfy the commutative, associative and distributive laws for addition and multiplication. Moreover, if we add, subtract, multiply or divide (except by zero) two rational numbers, we still get a rational number (that is, rational numbers are closed with respect to addition, subtraction, multiplication and division). It turns out that irrational numbers also satisfy the commutative, associative and distributive laws for addition and multiplication. However, the sum, difference, quotients and products of irrational numbers are not always irrational. For example, (V6) + (-v6) .(V2) - (v2), (V3)-(v3) and a are rationals. Let us look at what happens when we add and multiply a rational number with an irrational number. For example, V3 is irrational. What about 2 + J3 and 2/3 ? Since V3 has a non-terminating non-recurring decimal expansion, the same is true for 2+~3 and 23. Therefore, both 2+ ./3 and 2./3 are also irrational numbers. Example 11 : Check whether 7,/5 , # V2 +21, -2 are irrational numbers or not. Solution: 5 =2.236..., 2 = 1.4142... 7= 3.1415... W575 Then 7./5 = 15.652..., Vs J5vs ~ 5 = 3.1304... V2 +21 = 22.4142... 1-2 = 1.1415... All these are non-terminating non-recurring decimals. So, all these are irrational numbers. Now, let us see what generally happens if we add, subtract, multiply, divide, take square roots and even nth roots of these irrational numbers, where 7 is any natural number. Let us look at some examples. Example 12 : Add 2/2 + 5V3 and J/2 -3V3. Solution : (2V2 + 53) +(J2 -3V3) = (2V2 + V2) + (5v3 -3N3) = (2+ 1) V2 + (5 3)V3 =3V2 + 23 Reprint 2025-26 16 MATHEMATICS Example 13 : Multiply 6/5 by 2,/5. Solution: 6J5 x 2/5 =6x2x J5 x J5 =12x5=60 Example 14 : Divide 8/15 by 2/3 . Solution : 8J15 + 2/3 = 83 x V5 = 4/5 These examples may lead you to expect the following facts, which are true: (i) The sum or difference of a rational number and an irrational number is irrational. (ii) The product or quotient of a non-zero rational number with an irrational number is irrational. (iti) If we add, subtract, multiply or divide two irrationals, the result may be rational or irrational. We now turn our attention to the operation of taking square roots of real numbers. Recall that, if a is a natural number, then a = b means b?= a and b > 0. The same definition can be extended for positive real numbers. Let a > 0 be a real number. Then J/g =b means b? = a and b> 0. In Section 1.2, we saw how to represent ./n for any positive integer n on the number line. We now show how
