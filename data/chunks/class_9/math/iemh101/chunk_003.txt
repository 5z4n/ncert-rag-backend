outside the Pythagoras (569 BCE 479 BCE) secret Pythagorean sect! Fig. 1.3 Let us formally define these numbers. A number s is called irrational, if it cannot be written in the form a where p and g are integers and q # 0. Reprint 2025-26 6 MATHEMATICS You already know that there are infinitely many rationals. It turns out that there are infinitely many irrational numbers too. Some examples are: V2, V3, 15m, 0.10110111011110... Remark : Recall that when we use the symbol ./ , we assume that it is the positive square root of the number. So ./4 = 2, though both 2 and 2 are square roots of 4. Some of the irrational numbers listed above are familiar to you. For example, you have already come across many of the square roots listed above and the number 7. The Pythagoreans proved that ./2 is irrational. Later in approximately 425 BC, Theodorus of Cyrene showed that 3, /5, /6, J7, V10, V11, V12, V13, V14, V15 and ,/17 are also irrationals. Proofs of irrationality of /7 , /3, J/5, etc., shall be discussed in Class X. As to zm, it was known to various cultures for thousands of years, it was proved to be irrational by Lambert and Legendre only in the late 1700s. In the next section, we will discuss why 0.10110111011110... and z are irrational. Let us return to the questions raised at the end of the previous section. Remember the bag of rational numbers. If we now put all irrational numbers into the bag, will there be any number left on the number line? The answer is no! It turns out that the collection of all rational numbers and irrational numbers together make up what we call the collection of real numbers, which is denoted by R. Therefore, a real number is either rational or irrational. So, we can say that every real number is represented by a unique point on the number line. Also, every point on the number line represents a unique real number. This is why we call the number line, the real number line. In the 1870s two German mathematicians, Cantor and Dedekind, showed that : Corresponding to every real number, there is a point on the real number line, and corresponding to every point on the number line, there exists a unique real number.

Example 3 : Locate V2 on the number line. Solution : It is easy to see how the Greeks might have discovered B V2 . Consider a square OABC, with each side | unit in length (see O A Fig. 1.6). Then you can see by the Pythagoras theorem that OB = ,/I? +? =/2 . How do we represent 2 onthe number line? Fig. 1.6 This is easy. Transfer Fig. 1.6 onto the number line
