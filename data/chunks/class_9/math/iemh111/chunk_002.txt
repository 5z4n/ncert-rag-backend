+ 7 , we have I= 16? +12? cm=20cm Reprint 2025-26 140 MATHEMATICS So, curved surface area = mrl = 3.14 x 12 x 20 cm? = 753.6 cm? Further, total surface area = mr] + mr? = (753.6 + 3.14 x 12 x 12) cm? = (753.6 + 452.16) cm? = 1205.76 cm? Example 3 : A corn cob (see Fig. 11.5), shaped somewhat like a cone, has the radius of its broadest end as 2.1 cm and length (height) as 20 cm. If each 1 cm? of the surface of the cob carries an average of four grains, find how many grains Fig. 11.5 you would find on the entire cob. Solution : Since the grains of corn are found only on the curved surface of the corn cob, we would need to know the curved surface area of the corn cob to find the total number of grains on it. In this question, we are given the height of the cone, so we need to find its slant height. Here, 1= Jr? +h? = J(2.1? +20? om = ./404.41 cm = 20.11 cm Therefore, the curved surface area of the corn cob = 7/1 =a * 2.1 x 20.11 cm? = 132.726 cm? = 132.73 cm? (approx.) Number of grains of corn on | cm? of the surface of the corn cob = 4 Therefore, number of grains on the entire curved surface of the cob = 132.73 x 4= 530.92 = 531 (approx.) So, there would be approximately 531 grains of corn on the cob. EXERCISE 11.1 22 . Assume 1 = - unless stated otherwise. 1. Diameter of the base ofa cone is 10.5 cm and its slant height is 10 cm.
