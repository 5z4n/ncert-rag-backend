the two cases. A hemispherical bowl made of brass has inner diameter 10.5 cm. Find the cost of tin-plating it on the inside at the rate of F 16 per 100 cm . Find the radius of a sphere whose surface area is 154 cm . The diameter of the moon is approximately one fourth of the diameter of the earth. Find the ratio of their surface areas. A hemispherical bowl is made of steel, 0.25 cm thick. The inner radius of the bowl is 5 cm. Find the outer curved surface area of the bowl. <r A right circular cylinder just encloses a sphere of radius r (see Fig. 11.10). Find * (i) surface area of the sphere, (ii) curved surface area of the cylinder, (iii) ratio of the areas obtained in (i) and (ii). Fig. 11.10 11.3 Volume of a Right Circular Cone In earlier classes we have studied the volumes of cube, cuboid and cylinder In Fig 11.11, can you see that there is a right circular h cylinder and a right circular cone of the same base radius and the same height? Fig. 11.11 Activity : Try to make a hollow cylinder and a hollow cone like this with the same base radius and the same height (see Fig. 11.11). Then, we can try out an experiment that will help us, to see practically what the volume of a right circular cone would be! r > ia > h h h (a) (b) (c) Fig. 11.12 Reprint 2025-26 146 MATHEMATICS So, let us start like this. Fill the cone up to the brim with sand once, and empty it into the cylinder. We find that it fills up only a part of the cylinder [see Fig. 11.12(a)]. When we fill up the cone again to the brim, and empty it into the cylinder, we see that the cylinder is still not full [see Fig. 11.12(b)]. When the cone is filled up for the third time, and emptied into the cylinder, it can be seen that the cylinder is also full to the brim [see Fig. 11.12(c)]. With this, we can safely come to the conclusion that three times the volume of a cone, makes up the volume of a cylinder, which has the same base radius and the same height as the cone, which means that the volume of the cone is one-third the volume of the cylinder. So, Volume of a Cone = 3th where + is the base radius and / is the height of the cone. Example 8 : The height and the slant height ofa cone are 21 cm and 28 cm respectively. Find the volume of the cone. Solution : From [ =r ? + h , we have r= JP -0 = 28 27 em = 7V7em 1 1 22 So, volume of the cone = 3 trh = 3 x 7 x W7 x 77 x 21 em: = 7546 cm?
