height of the cone which is represented by /). It looks like a part of a round cake. (ii) Ifyou now bring the sides marked A and B at the tips together, you can see that the curved portion of Fig. 11.3 (c) will form the circular base of the cone. Fig. 11.3 -_ ~s b, i B (a) (b) a ) (iit) Ifthe paper like the one in Fig. 11.3 (c) is now cut into hundreds of little pieces, along the lines drawn from the point O, each cut portion is almost a small triangle, whose height is the slant height / of the cone. (iv) Now the area of each triangle = 5 x base of each triangle ~ /. So, area of the entire piece of paper Reprint 2025-26 SURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES 139 = sum of the areas of all the triangles 1 1 1 1 = Shl + Sb + Sb te = 5 (b, +b, +b, ++) ay x 1 x length of entire curved boundary of Fig. 11.3(c) (as b, + b, + b, +... makes up the curved portion of the figure) But the curved portion of the figure makes up the perimeter of the base of the cone and the circumference of the base of the cone = 2mr, where r is the base radius of the cone. So, |Curved Surface Area of a Cone = </X 2nr=nrl a YZ | { where + is its base radius and / its slant height. ip Note that ? = 7 + /? (as can be seen from Fig. 11.4), by i applying Pythagoras Theorem. Here / is the height of the cone. Fig. 11.4 Therefore, /= fr? + 8 Now if the base of the cone is to be closed, then a circular piece of paper of radius r is also required whose area is 7 . So,| Total Surface Area of a Cone = arl + nr? = amr(J + r) Example 1 : Find the curved surface area of a right circular cone whose slant height is 10 cm and base radius is 7 cm. Solution : Curved surface area = trl 7 x 7x 10 cm? 220 cm? Example 2 : The height of a cone is 16 cm and its base radius is 12 cm. Find the curved surface area and the total surface area of the cone (Use z = 3.14). Solution : Here, A = 16 cm and r= 12 cm. So, from 7? = h? + 7 , we have I= 16? +12? cm=20cm Reprint 2025-26 140 MATHEMATICS So, curved surface area = mrl = 3.14 x 12 x 20 cm? = 753.6 cm? Further, total surface area = mr] + mr? = (753.6 + 3.14 x 12 x 12) cm? = (753.6 + 452.16) cm? = 1205.76 cm? Example 3 : A corn cob (see Fig. 11.5), shaped somewhat like a cone, has the radius of its broadest end as 2.1 cm and length
