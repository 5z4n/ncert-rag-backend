of the cone. Example 8 : The height and the slant height ofa cone are 21 cm and 28 cm respectively. Find the volume of the cone. Solution : From [ =r ? + h , we have r= JP -0 = 28 27 em = 7V7em 1 1 22 So, volume of the cone = 3 trh = 3 x 7 x W7 x 77 x 21 em: = 7546 cm? Example 9 : Monica has a piece of canvas whose area is 551 m?. She uses it to have a conical tent made, with a base radius of 7 m. Assuming that all the stitching margins and the wastage incurred while cutting, amounts to approximately 1 m7, find the volume of the tent that can be made with it. Solution : Since the area of the canvas = 551 m and area of the canvas lost in wastage is | m , therefore the area of canvas available for making the tent is (551 1) m* = 550 m . Now, the surface area of the tent = 550 m? and the required base radius of the conical tent = 7m Note that a tent has only a curved surface (the floor of a tent is not covered by canvas!!). Reprint 2025-26 SURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES 147 Therefore, curved surface area of tent = 550 m . That is, trl = 550 Or, x7x l= 550 [= 3a m=25 or, = 35 m= 25m Now, P=rt+h Therefore, h= JP -r? = 25 -7 m= [625 49 m = J576 m = 24m 1, 1 2 ; So, the volume of the conical tent = 3 h= 3 x > x 7x 7x 24 m= 1232 m .
