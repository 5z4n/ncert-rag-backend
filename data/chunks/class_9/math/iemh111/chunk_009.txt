are getting the same result, namely, the volume of a sphere is equal to 37 times the cube of its radius. This gives us the idea that Volume of a Sphere = rule where r is the radius of the sphere. Later, in higher classes it can be proved also. But at this stage, we will just take it as true. Reprint 2025-26 SURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES 149 Since a hemisphere is half of a sphere, can you guess what the volume of a .. 1.4 3 2 hemisphere will be? Yes, it is 5 of 3 tr = 3 tr. So, | Volume of a Hemisphere = 3m where r is the radius of the hemisphere. Let us take some examples to illustrate the use of these formulae. Example 10 : Find the volume of a sphere of radius 11.2 cm. Solution : Required volume = 3 mr? = sxx 11.2 11.2 x 11.2 cm? = 5887.32 cm? Example 11: A shot-putt is a metallic sphere of radius 4.9 cm. If the density of the metal is 7.8 g per cm , find the mass of the shot-putt. Solution : Since the shot-putt is a solid sphere made of metal and its mass is equal to the product of its volume and density, we need to find the volume of the sphere. Now, volume of the sphere = 3m _ 5 XX 4.9% 49x 4.9 om = 493 cm? (nearly) Further, mass of | cm? of metal is 7.8 g. Therefore, mass of the shot-putt = 7.8 x 493 g = 3845.44 g =3.85 kg (nearly) Example 12: A hemispherical bowl has a radius of 3.5 cm. What would be the volume of water it would contain? Solution : The volume of water the bowl can contain Tr 2 22 3 x > x 3.5 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm? = 89.8 cm? Reprint 2025-26 150 MATHEMATICS EXERCISE 11.4 22 ; Assume 1 = 7 unless stated otherwise. 1.
