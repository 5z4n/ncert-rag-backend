radius 7 cm would be Anr = 4 x > x 7x 7 cm? = 616 cm? Example 5 : Find (1) the curved surface area and (ii) the total surface area of a hemisphere of radius 21 cm. Solution : The curved surface area of a hemisphere of radius 21 cm would be = 2nr=2 x 7 x 21 x 21 em? = 2772 cm? Reprint 2025-26 144 MATHEMATICS (11) the total surface area of the hemisphere would be 3nr? = 3x 7 x 21 x 21 cm? = 4158 cm? Example 6 : The hollow sphere, in which the circus motorcyclist performs his stunts, has a diameter of 7 m. Find the area available to the motorcyclist for riding. Solution : Diameter of the sphere = 7 m. Therefore, radius is 3.5 m. So, the riding space available for the motorcyclist is the surface area of the sphere which is given by 4nr? = 4 x 7 x 3.5 x 3.5 m? = 154 m? Example 7 : A hemispherical dome of a building needs to be painted (see Fig. 11.9). If the circumference of the base of the dome is 17.6 m, find the cost of painting it, given the cost of painting is 5 per 100 cm . Solution : Since only the rounded surface of the dome is to be painted, we would need to find the curved surface area of the hemisphere to know the extent of painting that needs to be done. Now, circumference of the dome = 17.6 m. Therefore, 17.6 = 27r. m=2.8m So, the radius of the dome = 17.6 x u 2x22 The curved surface area of the dome = 27 =2*x ze x 2.8 x 2.8 m? = 49.28 m? Now, cost of painting 100 cm? is & 5. So, cost of painting 1 m? == 500 Therefore, cost of painting the whole dome Fig. 11.9 = 500 x 49.28 = 24640 EXERCISE 11.2 22 .
