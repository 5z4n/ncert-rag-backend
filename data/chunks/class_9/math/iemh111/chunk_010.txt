litres of milk can a hemispherical bowl of diameter 10.5 cm hold? 6. A hemispherical tank is made up of an iron sheet 1 cm thick. If the inner radius is 1 m, then find the volume of the iron used to make the tank. 7. Find the volume of a sphere whose surface area is 154 cm?. 8. Adome ofa building is in the form of a hemisphere. From inside, it was white-washed at the cost of = 4989.60. If the cost of white-washing is = 20 per square metre, find the (i) inside surface area of the dome, (ii) volume of the air inside the dome. 9. Twenty seven solid iron spheres, each of radius r and surface area S are melted to form a sphere with surface area S . Find the (i) radius r of the new sphere, (ii) ratio of S and S . 10. A capsule of medicine is in the shape of a sphere of diameter 3.5 mm. How much medicine (in mm*) is needed to fill this capsule? 11.5 Summary In this chapter, you have studied the following points: 1. Curved surface area of a cone = rl 2. Total surface area of a right circular cone = 171+ mr , i.e., ar (+r) 3. Surface area ofa sphere of radius r=4 7? 4. Curved surface area of a hemisphere = 27 5. Total surface area of a hemisphere = 317" 6. Volume ofa cone= 3 th 7. Volume of a sphere of radius r= 37 r 8. Volume of a hemisphere = 3 Tr [Here, letters /, b, h, a, r, etc. have been used in their usual meaning, depending on the context. ] Reprint 2025-26
