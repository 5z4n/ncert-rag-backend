y and z. Solution: y+55 = 180 (Interior angles on the same side of the transversal ED) Therefore, y = 180 55 = 125 Again x=y (AB || CD, Corresponding angles axiom) Therefore x = 125 Fig. 6.22 Now, since AB || CD and CD || EF, therefore, AB || EF. So, Z EAB+ Z FEA = 180 (Interior angles on the same side of the transversal EA) Therefore, 90 + z+ 55 = 180 Which gives z= 35 EXERCISE 6.2 1. InFig. 6.23, if AB || CD, CD || EF andy :z=3:7, find x.

An incident ray AB strikes the mirror PQ at B, the reflected ray moves along the path BC and strikes the mirror RS at C and again reflects back along CD. Prove that AB||CD.

Ifaray stands ona line, then the sum of the two adjacent angles so formed is 180 and viceversa. This property is called as the Linear pair axiom. 2. Iftwo lines intersect each other, then the vertically opposite angles are equal. 3. Lines which are parallel to a given line are parallel to each other. Reprint 2025-26
