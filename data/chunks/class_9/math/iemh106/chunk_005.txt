Z SOR + Z POS = 360 . Solution : In Fig. 6.11, you need to produce any of the rays OP, OQ, OR or OS backwards to a point. Let us produce ray OQ backwards to a point T so that TOQ is a line (see Fig. 6.12). Now, ray OP stands on line TOQ. Therefore, Z TOP + Z POQ = 180 (1) (Linear pair axiom) Similarly, ray OS stands on line TOQ. Therefore, Z TOS + Z SOQ = 180 (2) But Z SOQ = Z SOR + Z QOR So, (2) becomes Z TOS + Z SOR + Z QOR = 180 Now, adding (1) and (3), you get Z TOP + Z POQ+ Z TOS + Z SOR + Z QOR = 360 (4) But Z TOP + Z TOS = Z POS Therefore, (4) becomes Z POQ+ Z QOR + Z SOR + Z POS = 360 EXERCISE 6.1 1.

Reprint 2025-26 78 MATHEMATICS 6.5 Lines Parallel to the Same Line If two lines are parallel to the same line, will they be parallel to each other? Let us check it. See Fig. 6.18 in which line m || line / and line 7 || line /. Let us draw a line transversal for the lines, /, m and n. It is given that line m || line / and line 7 || line /. t Therefore, Z1= 22 and Z1=23 (Corresponding angles axiom) 1 So, Z2=Z3 (Why?) 7 But 2 2 and 7 3 are corresponding angles and they are equal. Therefore, you can say that n . Line m || Line n (Converse of corresponding angles axiom) Fig. 6.18 This result can be stated in the form of the following theorem: Theorem 6.6 : Lines which are parallel to the same line are parallel to each other. Note : The property above can be extended to more than two lines also. Now, let us solve some examples related to parallel lines. Example 4 : In Fig. 6.19, if PQ || RS, ZMXQ = 135 and
