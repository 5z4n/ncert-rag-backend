n . Line m || Line n (Converse of corresponding angles axiom) Fig. 6.18 This result can be stated in the form of the following theorem: Theorem 6.6 : Lines which are parallel to the same line are parallel to each other. Note : The property above can be extended to more than two lines also. Now, let us solve some examples related to parallel lines. Example 4 : In Fig. 6.19, if PQ || RS, ZMXQ = 135 and Z MYR = 40 , find Z XMY. P x Q 40 Fig. 6.19 Fig. 6.20 Solution : Here, we need to draw a line AB parallel to line PQ, through point M as shown in Fig. 6.20. Now, AB || PQ and PQ || RS. Reprint 2025-26 LINES AND ANGLES 719 Therefore, AB || RS (Why?) Now, ZQXM + Z XMB = 180 (AB || PQ, Interior angles on the same side of the transversal XM) But Z QXM = 135 So, 135 + Z XMB = 180 Therefore, Z XMB = 45 (1) Now, Z BMY = Z MYR (AB || RS, Alternate angles) Therefore, Z BMY = 40 (2) Adding (1) and (2), you get Z XMB + Z BMY = 45 + 40 That is, Z XMY = 85 Example 5 : If a transversal intersects two lines such that the bisectors of a pair of corresponding angles are parallel, then prove that the two lines are parallel. Solution : In Fig. 6.21, a transversal AD intersects two lines PQ and RS at points B and C respectively. Ray BE is the bisector of Z ABQ and ray CG is the bisector of Z BCS; and BE || CG. We are to prove that PQ || RS. It is given that ray BE is the bisector of Z ABQ. Therefore, Z ABE= 5 Z ABQ (1) Similarly, ray CG is the bisector of Z BCS. Therefore, 2BCG= 5 Z BCS (2) But BE || CG and AD is the transversal. Therefore, Z ABE= Z BCG (Corresponding angles axiom) (3) Substituting (1) and (2) in (3), you get 1 1 7 <ABQ= 7 < BCS That is, Z ABQ= ZBCS Reprint 2025-26 80 MATHEMATICS But, they are the corresponding angles formed by transversal AD with PQ and RS; and are equal. Therefore, PQ || RS (Converse of corresponding angles axiom) Example 6: In Fig. 6.22, AB || CD and CD || EF. Also EA 1 AB. If 7 BEF = 55 , find the values of x, y and z. Solution: y+55 = 180 (Interior angles on the same side of the transversal ED) Therefore, y = 180 55 = 125 Again x=y (AB || CD, Corresponding angles axiom) Therefore x = 125 Fig. 6.22 Now, since AB || CD and CD || EF, therefore, AB || EF. So, Z EAB+ Z FEA = 180 (Interior angles on the same side of the transversal EA) Therefore, 90 + z+ 55 = 180 Which gives z= 35 EXERCISE
