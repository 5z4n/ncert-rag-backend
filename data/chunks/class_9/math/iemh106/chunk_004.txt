the proof given below. Theorem 6.1 : If two lines intersect each other, then the vertically opposite angles are equal. Proof : In the statement above, it is given that two lines intersect each other . So, let AB and CD be two lines intersecting at O as shown in Fig. 6.8. They lead to two pairs of vertically opposite angles, namely, (i) Z AOC and Z BOD (ii) Z AOD and Z BOC. Fig. 6.8 : Vertically opposite angles We need to prove that Z AOC = Z BOD and Z AOD = Z BOC. Now, ray OA stands on line CD. Therefore, Z AOC + Z AOD = 180 (Linear pair axiom) (1) Can we write Z AOD + Z BOD = 180 ? Yes! (Why?) (2) From (1) and (2), we can write Z AOC + Z AOD = Z AOD + Z BOD This implies that 7 AOC = Z BOD (Refer Section 5.2, Axiom 3) Similarly, it can be proved that ZAOD = ZBOC Now, let us do some examples based on Linear Pair Axiom and Theorem 6.1. Reprint 2025-26 LINES AND ANGLES Example 1 : In Fig. 6.9, lines PQ and RS intersect each other at point O. If P Z POR: Z ROQ=5: 7, find all the angles. Solution: Z POR +Z ROQ = 180 (Linear pair of angles) But Z POR: ZROQ=5:7 R (Given) Therefore, Z POR = D x 180 = 75 _. 7 Similarly, Z ROQ= D x 180 = 105 Now, Z POS = ZROQ = 105 and Z SOQ = ZPOR = 75 (Vertically opposite angles) (Vertically opposite angles) Example 2 : In Fig. 6.10, ray OS stands on a line POQ. Ray OR and ray OT are angle bisectors of Z POS and Z SOQ, respectively. If Z POS =x, find Z ROT. Solution : Ray OS stands on the line POQ. Therefore, Z POS + Z SOQ = 180 But, Z POS =x Therefore, x + Z SOQ = 180 So, Z SOQ = 180 x Now, ray OR bisects Z POS, therefore, Z ROS = > x Z POS 1 x = -xyo 2 " 9 Similarly, Z SOT = > x Z SOQ = x o_ 5 * (180 =) = 99 -= Reprint 2025-26 76 MATHEMATICS Now, Z ROT = ZROS + Z SOT ~~ +90 -~ 2 2 = 90 Example 3 : In Fig. 6.11, OP, OQ, OR and OS are four rays. Prove that 7 POQ + Z QOR + Z SOR + Z POS = 360 . Solution : In Fig. 6.11, you need to produce any of the rays OP, OQ, OR or OS backwards to a point. Let us produce ray OQ backwards to a point T so that TOQ is a line (see Fig. 6.12). Now, ray OP stands on line TOQ. Therefore, Z TOP + Z POQ = 180 (1) (Linear pair axiom) Similarly, ray OS stands on line TOQ. Therefore, Z TOS + Z
