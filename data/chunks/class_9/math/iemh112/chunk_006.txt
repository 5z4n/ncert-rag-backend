The following table gives the distribution of students of two sections according to the marks obtained by them: Section A Section B Marks Frequency Marks Frequency 0-10 3 0-10 5 10-20 9 10-20 19 20-30 17 20 - 30 15 30-40 12 30-40 10 40-50 9 40 -50 1 Represent the marks of the students of both the sections on the same graph by two frequency polygons. From the two polygons compare the performance of the two sections.
