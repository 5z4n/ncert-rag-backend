widths for all bars and maintain equal gaps in between. Let one Head be represented by one unit. 2. We represent the expenditure (value) on the vertical axis. Since the maximum expenditure is 5000, we can choose the scale as | unit = 71000. 3. To represent our first Head, i.e., grocery, we draw a rectangular bar with width 1 unit and height 4 units. 4. Similarly, other Heads are represented leaving a gap of | unit in between two consecutive bars. The bar graph is drawn in Fig. 12.2.

Therefore, in some ways it serves as a better representation of data than the tabular form. Activity 1 : Continuing with the same four groups of Activity 1, represent the data by suitable bar graphs. Let us now see how a frequency distribution table for continuous class intervals can be represented graphically. Reprint 2025-26 154 MATHEMATICS (B) Histogram This is a form of representation like the bar graph, but it is used for continuous class intervals. For instance, consider the frequency distribution Table 12.2, representing the weights of 36 students of a class: Table 12.2 Let us represent the data given above graphically as follows: (1) We represent the weights on the horizontal axis ona suitable scale. We can choose the scale as | cm = 5 kg. Also, since the first class interval is starting from 30.5 and not zero, we show it on the graph by marking a kink or a break on the axis. (ii) We represent the number of students (frequency) on the vertical axis on a suitable scale. Since the maximum frequency is 15, we need to choose the scale to accomodate this maximum frequency. (iit) We now draw rectangles (or rectangular bars) of width equal to the class-size and lengths according to the frequencies of the corresponding class intervals. For example, the rectangle for the class interval 30.5 - 35.5 will be of width 1 cm and length 4.5 cm. (iv) In this way, we obtain the graph as shown in Fig. 12.3: Reprint 2025-26 STATISTICS 155 14 10 Number of Students > yo Fk DW e) 30.5 35.5 40.5 45.5 50.5 55.5 60.5. 65.5 Weights (in kg) > Fig, 12.3 Observe that since there are no gaps in between consecutive rectangles, the resultant graph appears like a solid figure. This is called a histogram, which is a graphical representation of a grouped frequency distribution with continuous classes. Also, unlike a bar graph, the width of the bar plays a significant role in its construction. Here, in fact, areas of the rectangles erected are proportional to the corresponding frequencies. However, since the widths of the rectangles
