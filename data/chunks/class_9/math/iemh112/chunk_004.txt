in Table 12.5. Table 12.5 Draw a frequency polygon corresponding to this frequency distribution table. Solution : Let us first draw a histogram for this data and mark the mid-points of the tops of the rectangles as B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, respectively. Here, the first class is 0-10. So, to find the class preceeding 0-10, we extend the horizontal axis in the negative direction and find the mid-point of the imaginary class-interval ( 10) - 0. The first end point, 1.e., B is joined to this mid-point with zero frequency on the negative direction of the horizontal axis. The point where this line segment meets the vertical axis is marked as A. Let L be the mid-point of the class succeeding the last class of the given data. Then OABCDEFGHIJKL is the frequency polygon, which is shown in Fig. 12.7. ee ee o N Number of Students -10 O 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Marks = _ _> Fig. 12.7 Reprint 2025-26 STATISTICS 161 Frequency polygons can also be drawn independently without drawing histograms. For this, we require the mid-points of the class-intervals used in the data. These mid-points of the class-intervals are called class-marks. To find the class-mark of a class interval, we find the sum of the upper limit and lower limit of a class and divide it by 2. Thus, Upper limit + Lower limit Class-mark = Let us consider an example. Example 5: Ina city, the weekly observations made in a study on the cost of living index are given in the following table: Table 12.6 Draw a frequency polygon for the data above (without constructing a histogram). Solution : Since we want to draw a frequency polygon without a histogram, let us find the class-marks of the classes given above, that is of 140 - 150, 150 - 160..... For 140 - 150, the upper limit = 150, and the lower limit = 140 150+140 290 2 7) Continuing in the same manner, we find the class-marks of the other classes as well. So, the new table obtained is as shown in the following table: So, the class-mark = = 145, Reprint 2025-26 162 MATHEMATICS Table 12.7 We can now draw a frequency polygon by plotting the class-marks along the horizontal axis, the frequencies along the vertical-axis, and then plotting and joining the points B(145, 5), C(155, 10), D(165, 20), E(175, 9), F185, 6) and G(195, 2) by line segments. We should not forget to plot the point corresponding to the class-mark of the class 130 - 140 Gust before the lowest class 140 - 150) with zero frequency, that is, A(135, 0), and the point H (205, 0) occurs immediately after G(195, 2). So, the resultant frequency polygon will be ABCDEFGH (see Fig. 12.8).
