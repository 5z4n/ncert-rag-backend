to plot the point corresponding to the class-mark of the class 130 - 140 Gust before the lowest class 140 - 150) with zero frequency, that is, A(135, 0), and the point H (205, 0) occurs immediately after G(195, 2). So, the resultant frequency polygon will be ABCDEFGH (see Fig. 12.8). Number of Weeks O 135 145 155 165 175 185 195 205 215 Cost of Living Index > Fig. 12.8 Reprint 2025-26 Frequency polygons are used when the data is continuous and very large. It is very useful for comparing two different sets of data of the same nature, for example, comparing the performance of two different sections of the same class. 1. A survey conducted by an organisation for the cause of illness and death among the women between the ages 15 - 44 (in years) worldwide, found the following figures (in %): S.No. | Causes Female fatality rate ( %) 1. Reproductive health conditions 31.8 2. Neuropsychiatric conditions 25.4 3. Injuries 124 4. Cardiovascular conditions 43 5. Respiratory conditions 4.1 6. Other causes 22.0 (i) Represent the information given above graphically. (ii) Which condition is the major cause of women s ill health and death worldwide? (ii) Try to find out, with the help of your teacher, any two factors which play a major role in the cause in (ii) above being the major cause. 2. The following data on the number of girls (to the nearest ten) per thousand boys in different sections of Indian society is given below. Section Number of girls per thousand boys Scheduled Caste (SC) 940 Scheduled Tribe (ST) 970 Non SC/ST 920 Backward districts 950 Non-backward districts 920 Rural 930 Urban 910 Reprint 2025-26 164 MATHEMATICS (i) Represent the information above by a bar graph. (i) In the classroom discuss what conclusions can be arrived at from the graph. 3. Given below are the seats won by different political parties in the polling outcome of a state assembly elections: (i) Draw a bar graph to represent the polling results. (i) Which political party won the maximum number of seats? 4. The length of 40 leaves of a plant are measured correct to one millimetre, and the obtained data is represented in the following table: (i) Draw a histogram to represent the given data. [Hint: First make the class intervals continuous] (ii) Is there any other suitable graphical representation for the same data? (iil) Is it correct to conclude that the maximum number of leaves are 153 mm long? Why? 5. The following table gives the life times of 400 neon lamps: Reprint 2025-26 (i) Represent the given information with the help of a histogram. (it) How many lamps havea life time of more than 700 hours? The following table gives the distribution of students of two sections according to the marks obtained by them: Section A Section B Marks Frequency Marks Frequency 0-10 3 0-10 5 10-20 9 10-20 19 20-30 17 20 - 30 15 30-40 12 30-40 10 40-50
