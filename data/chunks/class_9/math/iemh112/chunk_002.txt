(in kg) > Fig, 12.3 Observe that since there are no gaps in between consecutive rectangles, the resultant graph appears like a solid figure. This is called a histogram, which is a graphical representation of a grouped frequency distribution with continuous classes. Also, unlike a bar graph, the width of the bar plays a significant role in its construction. Here, in fact, areas of the rectangles erected are proportional to the corresponding frequencies. However, since the widths of the rectangles are all equal, the lengths of the rectangles are proportional to the frequencies. That is why, we draw the lengths according to (iti) above. Now, consider a situation different from the one above. Example 3 : A teacher wanted to analyse the performance of two sections of students in a mathematics test of 100 marks. Looking at their performances, she found that a few students got under 20 marks and a few got 70 marks or above. So she decided to group them into intervals of varying sizes as follows: 0 - 20, 20 - 30, .. ., 60 - 70, 70 - 100. Then she formed the following table: Reprint 2025-26 156 MATHEMATICS Table 12.3 A histogram for this table was prepared by a student as shown in Fig. 12.4. Number of Students NBD co ie) 10.20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Marks > Fig. 12.4 Carefully examine this graphical representation. Do you think that it correctly represents the data? No, the graph is giving us a misleading picture. As we have mentioned earlier, the areas of the rectangles are proportional to the frequencies in a histogram. Earlier this problem did not arise, because the widths of all the rectangles were equal. But here, since the widths of the rectangles are varying, the histogram above does not Reprint 2025-26 give a correct picture. For example, it shows a greater frequency in the interval 70 - 100, than in 60 - 70, which is not the case. So, we need to make certain modifications in the lengths of the rectangles so that the areas are again proportional to the frequencies. The steps to be followed are as given below: 1. Selecta class interval with the minimum class size. In the example above, the minimum class-size is 10. 2. The lengths of the rectangles are then modified to be proportionate to the class-size 10. For instance, when the class-size is 20, the length of the rectangle is 7. So when the class-size is 10, the length of the rectangle will be 30 x 10=3.5. Similarly, proceeding in this manner, we get the following table: Marks Frequency Width of Length of the rectangle the class 0 - 20 7 20 ] 10=3.5 = xX = 20 : 20 - 30 10 10 10=10 - = = 30 - 40 10 10 0 10=10 - = = 20 40 - 50 20 10 10 x 10=20 50 - 60 20 10 10 x 10=20 60 - 70 15 10 =
