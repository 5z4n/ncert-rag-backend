rectangle will be 30 x 10=3.5. Similarly, proceeding in this manner, we get the following table: Marks Frequency Width of Length of the rectangle the class 0 - 20 7 20 ] 10=3.5 = xX = 20 : 20 - 30 10 10 10=10 - = = 30 - 40 10 10 0 10=10 - = = 20 40 - 50 20 10 10 x 10=20 50 - 60 20 10 10 x 10=20 60 - 70 15 10 = 10=15 4 = = 8 70 - 100 8 30 30 x 10= 2.67 Reprint 2025-26 MATHEMATICS Since we have calculated these lengths for an interval of 10 marks in each case, we may call these lengths as proportion of students per 10 marks interval . So, the correct histogram with varying width is given in Fig. 12.5. Propotion of students per 10 marks interval > ie) 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 =100 Marks > Fig. 12.5 (C) Frequency Polygon There is yet another visual way of representing quantitative data and its frequencies. This is a polygon. To see what we mean, consider the histogram represented by Fig. 12.3. Let us join the mid-points of the upper sides of the adjacent rectangles of this histogram by means of line segments. Let us call these mid-points B, C, D, E, F and G. When joined by line segments, we obtain the figure BCDEFG (see Fig. 12.6). To complete the polygon, we assume that there is a class interval with frequency zero Reprint 2025-26 STATISTICS 159 before 30.5 - 35.5, and one after 55.5 - 60.5, and their mid-points are A and H, respectively. ABCDEFGH is the frequency polygon corresponding to the data shown in Fig. 12.3. We have shown this in Fig. 12.6. Number of Students > O- 25.5305 35.5 40.5 45.5 50.5 55.5 60.5 H 65.5 Weights (in kg) _> Fig. 12.6 Although, there exists no class preceding the lowest class and no class succeeding the highest class, addition of the two class intervals with zero frequency enables us to make the area of the frequency polygon the same as the area of the histogram. Why is this so? (Hint : Use the properties of congruent triangles.) Now, the question arises: how do we complete the polygon when there is no class preceding the first class? Let us consider such a situation. Reprint 2025-26 160 MATHEMATICS Example 4 : Consider the marks, out of 100, obtained by 51 students of a class in a test, given in Table 12.5. Table 12.5 Draw a frequency polygon corresponding to this frequency distribution table. Solution : Let us first draw a histogram for this data and mark the mid-points of the tops of the rectangles as B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, respectively. Here, the first class is 0-10. So, to find the class preceeding 0-10, we extend the horizontal axis in the negative direction and find the mid-point of the imaginary class-interval ( 10)
