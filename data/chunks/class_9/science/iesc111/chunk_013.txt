rod. One strikes the end of the rod with a stone. Find the ratio of times taken by the sound wave in air and in aluminium to reach the second child. 8. The frequency of a source of sound is 100 Hz. How many times does it vibrate in a minute? 9. Does sound follow the same laws of reflection as light does? Explain. 10. When a sound is reflected from a distant object, an echo is produced. Let the distance between the reflecting surface and the source of sound production remains the same. Do you hear echo sound on a hotter day? 11. Give two practical applications of reflection of sound waves. 12. A stone is dropped from the top of a tower 500 m high into a pond of water at the base of the tower. When is the splash heard at the top? Given, g = 10 m s and speed of sound = 340 m st. SCIENCE Reprint 2025-26 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. SOUND A sound wave travels at a speed of 339 m st. If its wavelength is 1.5 cm, what is the frequency of the wave? Will it be audible? What is reverberation? How can it be reduced? What is loudness of sound? What factors does it depend on? How is ultrasound used for cleaning? Explain how defects in a metal block can be detected using ultrasound. Reprint 2025-26
