to note that the work done by gravity depends on the difference in vertical heights of the initial and final positions of the object and not on the path along which the object is moved. Fig. 10.8 shows a case where a block is raised from position A to B by taking two different paths. Let the height AB = h. In both the situations the work done on the object is mgh. Path 1 h Path 2 Fig. 10.8 Example 10.5 Find the energy possessed by an object of mass 10 kg when it is at a height of 6 m above the ground. Given, g=9.8ms . Solution: Mass of the object, m = 10 kg, displacement (height), h = 6 m, and acceleration due to gravity, g=9.8ms . From Eq. (10.6), Potential energy = mgh = 10kgx9.8ms?x6m = 588J. The potential energy is 588 J. SCIENCE Reprint 2025-26 Example 10.6 An object of mass 12 kg is at a certain height above the ground. If the potential energy of the object is 480 J, find the height at which the object is with respect to the ground. Given, g=10ms7 . Solution: Mass of the object, m= 12 kg, potential energy, E, = 480 J. E = mgh Pp 480 J = 12kgx10ms?xh 480 J The object is at the height of 4 m. 10.2.5 ARE VARIOUS ENERGY FORMS INTERCONVERTIBLE? Can we convert energy from one form to another? We find in nature a number of instances of conversion of energy from one form to another. Activity s 10.13 Sit in small groups. Discuss the various ways of energy conversion in nature. e Discuss following questions in your group: (a) How do green plants produce food? (b) Where do they get their energy from? (c) Why does the air move from place to place? (d) How are fuels, such as coal and petroleum formed? (e) What kinds of energy conversions sustain the water cycle? Activity e Many of the human activities and the gadgets we use involve conversion of energy from one form to another. Make a list of such activities and gadgets. e Identify in each activity/gadget the kind of energy conversion that takes place. Work AND ENERGY 10.2.6 LAW OF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY In activities 10.13 and 10.14, we learnt that the form of energy can be changed from one form to another. What happens to the total energy of a system during or after the process? Whenever energy gets transformed, the total energy remains unchanged. This is the law of conservation of energy. According to this law, energy can only be converted from one form to another; it can neither be created or destroyed. The total energy before and after the transformation remains the same. The law of conservation of energy is valid in all situations and for all kinds of transformations. Consider a simple example. Let an object of mass, mbe made to fall freely froma _ height, h. At the start, the potential energy
