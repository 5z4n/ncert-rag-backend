of mass 40 kg is raised to a height of 5 m above the ground. What is its potential energy? If the object is allowed to fall, find its kinetic energy when it is half-way down. What is the work done by the force of gravity on a satellite moving round the earth? Justify your answer. Can there be displacement of an object in the absence of any force acting on it? Think. Discuss this question with your friends and teacher. A person holds a bundle of hay over his head for 30 minutes and gets tired. Has he done some work or not? Justify your answer. An electric heater is rated 1500 W. How much energy does it use in 10 hours? Illustrate the law of conservation of energy by discussing the energy changes which occur when we draw a pendulum bob to one side and allow it to oscillate. Why does the bob Reprint 2025-26 16. 17. 18. 19. 20. 21. eventually come to rest? What happens to its energy eventually? Is it a violation of the law of conservation of energy? An object of mass, m is moving with a constant velocity, v. How much work should be done on the object in order to bring the object to rest? Calculate the work required to be done to stop a car of 1500 kg moving at a velocity of 60 km/h? In each of the following a force, F is acting on an object of mass, m. The direction of displacement is from west to east shown by the longer arrow. Observe the diagrams carefully and state whether the work done by the force is negative, positive or zero. F F F a - i -a Soni says that the acceleration in an object could be zero even when several forces are acting on it. Do you agree with her? Why? Find the energy in joules consumed in 10 hours by four devices of power 500 W each. A freely falling object eventually stops on reaching the ground. What happenes to its kinetic energy?
