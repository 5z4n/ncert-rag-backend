athlete etc. possess kinetic energy. In short, kinetic energy is the energy possessed by an object due to its motion. The kinetic energy of an object increases with its speed. How much energy is possessed by a moving body by virtue of its motion? By definition, we say that the kinetic energy ofa body moving with a certain velocity is equal to the work done on it to make it acquire that velocity. Reprint 2025-26 Let us now express the kinetic energy of an object in the form of an equation. Consider an object of mass, m moving with a uniform velocity, u. Let it now be displaced through a distance s when a constant force, Facts on it in the direction of its displacement. From Eq. (10.1), the work done, Wis F's. The work done on the object will cause a change in its velocity. Let its velocity change from u to v. Let a be the acceleration produced. We studied three equations of motion. The relation connecting the initial velocity (u) and final velocity (v) of an object moving with a uniform acceleration a, and the displacement, sis V-u ?=2as This gives 2a (10.2) From section 9.4, we know F = m a. Thus, using (Eq. 10.2) in Eq. (10.1), we can write the work done by the force, Fas _ (v? -u?) wemax| Ba }) or W = >m(v? -u?) (10.3) If the object is starting from its stationary position, that is, u = 0, then W= m v (10.4) It is clear that the work done is equal to the change in the kinetic energy of an object. If uw = 0, the work done will be 3 v Thus, the kinetic energy possessed by an object of mass, mand moving with a uniform velocity, vis EB, 55 mv (10.5) Example 10.3 An object of mass 15 kg is moving with a uniform velocity of 4 m s-'. What is the kinetic energy possessed by the object? Solution: Mass of the object, m= 15 kg, velocity of the object, v=4ms". From Eq. (10.5), E,,= mv?* 1 2 x 15kgx4ms'x4ms'! = 120J The kinetic energy of the object is 120 J. Example 10.4 What is the work to be done to increase the velocity of a car from 30 km h"! to 60 km h ! if the mass of the car is 1500 kg? Solution: Mass of the car, m7=1500 kg, initial velocity of car, u = 30 kmh" 30 x 1000m ~ 60x 60s 25/3ms". Similarly, the final velocity of the car, v= 60 km h'! =50/3ms. Therefore, the initial kinetic energy of the car, = 9% 1500 kg x (25/3 m s1)? = 156250/3 J. The final kinetic energy of the car, kf E,. = 5 * 1500 kg x (50/3 m s !)? = 625000/3 J. Thus, the work done = Change in kinetic energy = Ey Ey = 156250 J. SCIENCE Reprint 2025-26 uestions 1. What is the kinetic energy of an
