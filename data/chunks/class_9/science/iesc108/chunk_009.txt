From Eq. (8.4), we have F = ma. Here we have m, = 2 kg; a, = 5m s and m,=4kg;a,=2ms . Thus, F,=m,a,=2kgx5ms =10N; and F, = ma, =4kgx2ms *=8N. => F, > F,. Thus, accelerating a 2 kg mass at 5 m s? would require a greater force. Example 8.3 A motorcar is moving with a velocity of 108 km/h and it takes 4 s to stop after the brakes are applied. Calculate the force exerted by the brakes on the motorcar ifits mass along with the passengers is 1000 kg. Solution: The initial velocity of the motorcar u= 108 km/h = 108 x 1000 m/(60 x 60 s) =30ms! and the final velocity of the motorcar v=Oms'". The total mass of the motorcar along with its passengers = 1000 kg and the time taken to stop the motorcar, t= 4s. From Eq. (8.5) we have the magnitude of the force (F) applied by the brakes as m(v w/t. On substituting the values, we get F = 1000 kg x (0- 30) ms'/4s = 7500 kg m s or 7500 N. The negative sign tells us that the force exerted by the brakes is opposite to the direction of motion of the motorcar. Example 8.4 A force of 5 N gives a mass m,, an acceleration of 10 m s? anda mass m,,an acceleration of 20 m s . What acceleration would it give if both the masses were tied together? Solution: From Eq. (8.4) we have m, = F/a,; and m, = F/a,. Here, a, = 10 ms ; a,=20ms and F=5N. Thus, m,=5N/10ms =0.50 kg; and m, =5 N/20 m s = 0.25 kg. If the two masses were tied together, the total mass, m would be m=0.50 kg + 0.25 kg = 0.75 kg. The acceleration, a produced in the combined mass by the 5 N force would be, a= F/m=5N/0.75 kg = 6.67 ms . Example 8.5 The velocity-time graph of a ball of mass 20 g moving along a straight line on a long table is given in Fig. 8.9. - Fe NY DN oa oOo wo Velocity (cm/s) > ol 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 time (s) > Fig. 8.9 How much force does the table exert on the ball to bring it to rest? Solution: The initial velocity of the ball is 20 cms . Due to the frictional force exerted by the table, the velocity of the ball decreases down to zero in 10s. Thus, u=20cms'; v= 0Ocm s! and t= 10s. Since the velocity-time graph is a straight line, it is clear that the ball moves with a constant acceleration. The acceleration a is v-Uu t =(Ocms!-20cms'})/10s =-2cms?=-0.02 ms . a= SCIENCE Reprint 2025-26 The force exerted on the ball Fis, F= ma= (20/1000) kg x (- 0.02 m s ) = 0.0004 N. The negative sign implies that the frictional force exerted by the table is opposite to the direction of motion
