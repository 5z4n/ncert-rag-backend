with the moving ball? In doing so, the fielder increases the time during which the high velocity of the moving ball decreases to zero. Thus, the acceleration of the ball is decreased and therefore the impact of catching the fast moving ball (Fig. 8.8) is also reduced. If the ball is stopped suddenly then its high velocity decreases to zero ina very short interval of time. Thus, the rate of change of momentum of the ball will be large. Therefore, a large force would have to be applied for holding the catch that may hurt the palm of the fielder. In a high jump athletic event, the athletes are made to fall either on a cushioned bed or on a sand bed. This is to increase the time of the athlete fall to stop after making the jump. This decreases the rate of change of momentum and hence the force.

FORCE AND Laws OF Motion The first law of motion can be mathematically stated from the mathematical expression for the second law of motion. Eq. (8.4) is F=ma m(v wu) or F = 7. or Ft =mvu-mu (8.5) That is, when F= 0, v = u for whatever time, tis taken. This means that the object will continue moving with uniform velocity, u throughout the time, . If wis zero then vwill also be zero. That is, the object will remain at rest. Example 8.1 A constant force acts on an object of mass 5 kg for a duration of 2 s. It increases the objects velocity from 3 ms!to 7 ms. Find the magnitude of the applied force. Now, if the force was applied for a duration of 5 s, what would be the final velocity of the object? Solution: We have been given that u=3ms! andv=7ms!,t=2sandm =5kg. From Eq. (8.5) we have, m(v u) t Substitution of values in this relation gives F=5kg(7ms'!-3ms")/2s=l10N. Now, if this force is applied for a duration of 5s (t= 5s), then the final velocity can be calculated by rewriting Eq. (8.5) as Ft v=ut+ m On substituting the values of u, F, mand t, we get the final velocity, v=13ms". Reprint 2025-26 Example 8.2 Which would require a greater force accelerating a 2 kg mass at5ms *ora4kg mass at2ms?? Solution: From Eq. (8.4), we have F = ma. Here we have m, = 2 kg; a, = 5m s and m,=4kg;a,=2ms . Thus, F,=m,a,=2kgx5ms =10N; and F, = ma, =4kgx2ms *=8N. => F, > F,. Thus, accelerating a 2 kg mass at 5 m s? would require a greater force. Example 8.3 A motorcar is moving with a velocity of 108 km/h and it takes 4 s to stop after the brakes are applied. Calculate the force exerted by the
