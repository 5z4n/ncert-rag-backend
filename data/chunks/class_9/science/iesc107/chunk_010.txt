object? 2. What can you say about the motion ofvan object whose distance-time graph is a straight line parallel to the time axis? 3. What can you say about the motion of an object if its speedtime graph is a straight line parallel to the time axis? Motion 4. What is the quantity which is measured by the area occupied below the velocity-time graph? 7.5 Equations of Motion When an object moves along a straight line with uniform acceleration, it is possible to relate its velocity, acceleration during motion and the distance covered by it in a certain time interval by a set of equations known as the equations of motion. For convenience, a set of three such equations are given below: v =utat (7.5) s =ut+% at? (7.6) 2as =v -wu? (7.7) where uis the initial velocity of the object which moves with uniform acceleration a for time t, v is the final velocity, and s is the distance travelled by the object in time t. Eq. (7.5) describes the velocity-time relation and Eq. (7.6) represents the position-time relation. Eq. (7.7), which represents the relation between the position and the velocity, can be obtained from Eqs. (7.5) and (7.6) by eliminating t. These three equations can be derived by graphical method. Example 7.5 A train starting from rest attains a velocity of 72 km h? in 5 minutes. Assuming that the acceleration is uniform, find (i) the acceleration and (ii) the distance travelled by the train for attaining this velocity. Solution: We have been given u=0;v=72kmh'!=20ms'and t=5 minutes = 300 s. (i) From Eq. (7.5) we know that (y-u) a= Reprint 2025-26 (ii) From Eq. (7.7) we have 2as=v?-uw =v -0 Thus, 5) Ss = ___ 2a (20 ms y 2x(1/15)ms~ = 3000 m =3km The acceleration of the train is 15 ms? and the distance travelled is 3 km. Example 7.6 A car accelerates uniformly from 18 km h_ to 36 kmh in 5s. Calculate (i) the acceleration and (ii) the distance covered by the car in that time. Solution: We are given that u = 18kmh!=5ms'! v = 36kmh!=10ms'and t = 5s. (i) From Eq. (7.5) we have _v-u t 10ms'-5ms' ~ 5s =lms? (ii) From Eq. (7.6) we have s=ut+ at? 1 =5ms'!x5st g*ims*x(5s) =25m+12.5m = 37.5m 5 The acceleration of the caris 1 ms and the distance covered is 37.5 m. Example 7.7 The brakes applied to a car produce an acceleration of 6m s?in the opposite direction to the motion. If the car takes 2 s to stop after the application of brakes, calculate the distance it travels during this time. Solution: We have been given a=-6ms? ;t=2sandv=Oms1. From Eq. (7.5) we know that v=utat O=u+(-6ms%x25s or u=12ms'!. From Eq. (7.6) we get s=utt 2 at? =(12ms!)x(2s)+ 2 (-6 m s7) (2 s)? =24m-12m =12m Thus, the car will move 12 m before it stops after the application of brakes. Can you now appreciate why drivers are cautioned to maintain some distance between vehicles
