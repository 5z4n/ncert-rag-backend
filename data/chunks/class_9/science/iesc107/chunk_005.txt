She covers 180 m in one minute by swimming from one end to the other and back along the same straight path. Find the average speed and average velocity of Usha. Solution: Total distance covered by Usha in 1 min is 180 m. Displacement of Usha in 1 min = 0m Total distance covered Average speed = Totaltime taken 180m _ 180m x 1 min 60s ~ min lmin =3ms! Displacement Totaltimetaken Average velocity = Om 60s =Oms' The average speed of Usha is 3 ms" and her average velocity isO ms". 7.3 Rate of Change of Velocity During uniform motion of an object along a straight line, the velocity remains constant with time. In this case, the change in velocity of the object for any time interval is zero. However, in non-uniform motion, velocity varies with time. It has different values at different instants and at different points of the path. Thus, the change in velocity of the object during any time interval is not zero. Can we now express the change in velocity of an object? SCIENCE Reprint 2025-26 To answer such a question, we have to introduce another physical quantity called acceleration, which is a measure of the change in the velocity of an object per unit time. That is, change in velocity acceleration = ; time taken If the velocity of an object changes from an initial value u to the final value vin time t, the acceleration ais, a= : (7.3) This kind of motion is known as accelerated motion. The acceleration is taken to be positive if it is in the direction of velocity and negative when it is opposite to the direction of velocity. The SI unit of acceleration is ms~*. If an object travels in a straight line and its velocity increases or decreases by equal amounts in equal intervals of time, then the acceleration of the object is said to be uniform. The motion of a freely falling body is an example of uniformly accelerated motion. On the other hand, an object can travel with non-uniform acceleration if its velocity changes at a non-uniform rate. For example, if a car travelling along a straight road increases its speed by unequal amounts in equal intervals of time, then the car is said to be moving with non-uniform acceleration.
