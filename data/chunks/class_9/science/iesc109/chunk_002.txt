F Mxm (9.1) And the force between two objects is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, that is, a (9.2) Combining Eqs. (10.1) and (10.2), we get Mm F 2 (9.3) Mxm or, F=G - (9.4) where G is the constant of proportionality and is called the universal gravitation constant. By multiplying crosswise, Eq. (9.4) gives Fxd?=GMxm Reprint 2025-26 Fd or G= Mm The SI unit of G can be obtained by substituting the units of force, distance and mass in Eq. (9.5) as N m? kg . The value of G was found out by Henry Cavendish (1731 1810) by using a sensitive balance. The accepted value of G is 6.673 x 107"! N m ? kg . We know that there exists a force of attraction between any two objects. Compute the value of this force between you and your friend sitting closeby. Conclude how you do not experience this force! (9.5) The law is universal in the sense that it is applicable to all bodies, whether the bodies are big or small, whether they are celestial or terrestrial. Inverse-square Saying that F is inversely proportional to the square of d means, for example, that if d gets bigger by a factor of 6, F becomes ea io) S aN = 0) ow = 36 times smaller. Example 9.1 The mass of the earth is 6 x 1074 kg and that of the moon is 7.4x 10 kg. If the distance between the earth and the moon is 3.84x10 km, calculate the force exerted by the earth on the moon. (Take G = 6.7 x 10 !! N m? kg?) Solution: The mass of the earth, M=6 x 10% kg The mass of the moon, m=7.4 x 10 kg The distance between the earth and the moon, d= 3.84x10 km = 3.84~x 10 x 1000 m = 3.84~x 10%&m G= 6.7x10'Nm kg? From Eq. (9.4), the force exerted by the earth on the moon is Mxm F=G , _ 6.7 10''Nm*kg* 6 10%kg 7.4 10 kg (3.84 10 m)* = 2.02 x 10 N. Thus, the force exerted by the earth on the moon is 2.02 x 107 N. uestions 1. State the universal law of gravitation. 2. Write the formula to-find the magnitude of the gravitational force between the earth and an object on the surface of the earth. 9.1.2 IMPORTANCE OF THE UNIVERSAL LAW OF GRAVITATION The universal law of gravitation successfully explained several phenomena which were believed to be unconnected: (i) the force that binds us to the earth; (ii) the motion of the moon around the earth; (iii) the motion of planets around the Sun; and (iv) the tides due to the moon and the Sun. 9.2 Free Fall Let us try to understand the meaning of free fall by performing this activity. Activity 9.2 e Take a stone. e Throw it upwards. e It reaches a certain height and then it starts falling down. We have learnt that the
