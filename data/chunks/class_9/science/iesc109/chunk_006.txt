with which it is attracted towards the earth, the SI unit of weight is the same as that of force, that is, newton (N). The weight is a force acting vertically downwards; it has both magnitude and direction. We have learnt that the value of g is constant at a given place. Therefore at a given place, the weight of an object is directly proportional to the mass, say m, of the object, thatis, W mm. Itis due to this reason that at a given place, we can use the weight of an object as a measure of its mass. The mass of an object remains the same everywhere, that is, on the earth and on any planet whereas its weight depends on its location because g depends on location. 9.4.1 WEIGHT OF AN OBJECT ON THE MOON We have learnt that the weight of an object on the earth is the force with which the earth GRAVITATION attracts the object. In the same way, the weight of an object on the moon is the force with which the moon attracts that object. The mass of the moon is less than that of the earth. Due to this the moon exerts lesser force of attraction on objects. Let the mass of an object be m. Let its weight on the moon be W,,. Let the mass of the moon be M,, and its radius be R,. By applying the universal law of gravitation, the weight of the object on the moon will be M, m R? (9.16) Let the weight of the same object on the earth be W,. The mass of the earth is Mand its radius is R. Radius (m) 6.37 X 10 1.74 x 10 W,, =G Table 9.1 Celestial body 5.98 x 1074 7.36 X 1072 From Egs. (9.9) and (9.15) we have, Mm R?

(9.18a) by Eq. (9.18b), we get W,, _ 2.431 10 m W, 1.474 10" W,, 1 or Wo 0.165 = S (9.19) Weight of the objectonthemoon _ 1 Weight of theobjectontheearth 6 Weight of the object on the moon = (1/6) x its weight on the earth. Reprint 2025-26 Example 9.4 Mass of an object is 10 kg. What is its weight on the earth? Solution: Mass, m= 10 kg Acceleration due to gravity, g= 9.8 ms? W=mxg W=10kgx9.8ms?=98N Thus, the weight of the object is 98 N. Example 9.5 An object weighs 10 N when measured on the surface of the earth. What would be its weight when measured on the surface of the moon? Solution: We know, Weight of object on the moon = (1/6) x its weight on the earth. That is, W, _10 m6 6 = 1.67N. Thus, the weight of object on the surface of the moon would be 1.67 N. uestions
