force acts on an area equal to the contact area of your whole body, which is larger than the area of your feet. Thus, the effects of forces of the same magnitude on different areas are different. In the above cases, thrust is the same. But effects are different. Therefore the effect of thrust depends on the area on which it acts. The effect of thrust on sand is larger while standing than while lying. The thrust on unit area is called pressure. Thus, thrust area Substituting the SI unit of thrust and area in Eq. (9.20), we get the SI unit of pressure as N/ m? or Nm . In honour of scientist Blaise Pascal, the SI unit of pressure is called pascal, denoted as Pa. Let us consider a numerical example to understand the effects of thrust acting on different areas. Pressure = (9.20) Example 9.6 A block of wood is kept ona tabletop. The mass of wooden block is 5 kg and its dimensions are 40 cm x 20 cm x 10 cm. Find the pressure exerted Fig. 9.4 GRAVITATION by the wooden block on the table top if it is made to lie on the table top with its sides of dimensions (a) 20 cm x 10 cm and (b) 40 cm x 20 cm. Solution: The mass of the wooden block = 5 kg The dimensions = 40 cm x 20 cm x 10 cm Here, the weight of the wooden block applies a thrust on the table top. That is, Thrust=F = mxg = 5kgx9.8ms? = 49N Area of a side = length x breadth = 20cm x 10cm = 200 cm? = 0.02 m? From Eq. (9.20), 4ON Pressure = 0.02 m2 = 2450 N m . When the block lies on its side of dimensions 40 cm x 20 cm, it exerts the same thrust. Area= length x breadth = 40cm~x 20cm = 800 cm? = 0.08 m? From Eq. (9.20), 49N = 0.08 m? = 612.5 N m? The pressure exerted by the side 20 cm x 10 cm is 2450 N m ? and by the side 40 cm x 20 cm is 612.5 N m . Pressure Thus, the same force acting on a smaller area exerts a larger pressure, and a smaller pressure on a larger area. This is the reason why a nail has a pointed tip, knives have sharp edges and buildings have wide foundations. 9.5.1 PRESSURE IN FLUIDS All liquids and gases are fluids. A solid exerts pressure on a surface due to its weight. Similarly, fluids have weight, and they also Reprint 2025-26 exert pressure on the base and walls of the container in which they are enclosed. Pressure exerted in any confined mass of fluid is transmitted undiminished in all directions. 9.5.2 BUOYANCY Have you ever had a swim in a pool and felt lighter? Have you ever drawn water from a well and felt that the bucket of water is heavier when
