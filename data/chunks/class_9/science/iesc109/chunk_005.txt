and drops to the ground in 0.5 s. Let g = 10 m s* (for simplifying the calculations). (i) What is its speed on striking the ground? (ii) What is its average speed during the 0.5 s? (iii) How high is the ledge from the ground? Solution: Time, t= 4% second Initial velocity, u=Oms" Acceleration due to gravity, g=10ms? Acceleration of the car, a=+ 10ms2 (downward) (i) speed v = at v = 10ms?x0.5s = 5ms! ut+v (ii) average speed= 5 = (Oms?!?+5ms1)/2 = 2.5ms! (iii) distance travelled, s= %a?t? = %x10ms -x (0.5 8)? %x10ms? x 0.25 s? = 1.25m Thus, (i) its speed on striking the ground =5ms'! (ii) its average speed during the 0.5 s =2.5ms! (iii) height of the ledge from the ground = 1.25 m. Example 9.3 An object is thrown vertically upwards and rises to a height of 10 m. Calculate (i) the velocity with which the object was thrown upwards and (ii) the time taken by the object to reach the highest point. Solution: Distance travelled, s= 10m Final velocity, v>=Oms" Acceleration due to gravity, g = 9.8 ms? Acceleration of the object, a= -9.8 ms? (upward motion) (i) v?=w+2as O= u2+2x(-9.8ms )x 10m u?=-2x 9.8x 10 m s? u= 196 ms? u=14ms1 (ii) v=utat 0=14ms!-9.8ms?xt t=1.43 s. Thus, (i) Initial velocity, u= 14 ms", and (ii) Time taken, t= 1.43 s. uestions 1. What do you mean by free fall? 2. What do you mean by acceleration due to gravity? SCIENCE Reprint 2025-26 9.3. Mass We have learnt in the previous chapter that the mass of an object is the measure of its inertia . We have also learnt that greater the mass, the greater is the inertia. It remains the same whether the object is on the earth, the moon or even in outer space. Thus, the mass of an object is constant and does not change from place to place. 9.4 Weight We know that the earth attracts every object with a certain force and this force depends on the mass (zm) of the object and the acceleration due to the gravity (g). The weight of an object is the force with which it is attracted towards the earth. We know that F=mxa, (9.13) that is, F=mxg. (9.14) The force of attraction of the earth on an object is known as the weight of the object. It is denoted by W. Substituting the same in Eq. (9.14), we have W=mxg (9.15) As the weight of an object is the force with which it is attracted towards the earth, the SI unit of weight is the same as that of force, that is, newton (N). The weight is a force acting vertically downwards; it has both magnitude and direction. We have learnt that the value of g is constant at a given place. Therefore at a given place, the weight of an object is directly proportional to the mass, say m, of the object, thatis, W mm. Itis due to this
