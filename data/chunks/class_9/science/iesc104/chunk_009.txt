Explain with examples (i) Atomic number, (ii) Mass number, (iii) Isotopes and iv) Isobars. Give any two uses of isotopes. Na* has completely filled K and L shells. Explain. If bromine atom is available in the form of, say, two isotopes Br (49.7%) and &' Br (50.3%), calculate the average atomic mass of bromine atom. The average atomic mass of a sample of an element X is 16.2 u. What are the percentages of isotopes $X and '$X in the sample? If Z = 3, what would be the valency of the element? Also, name the element. Composition of the nuclei of two atomic species X and Y are given as under x Y Protons = 6 6 Neutrons = 6 8 Give the mass numbers of X and Y. What is the relation between the two species? For the following statements, write T for True and F for False. (a) J.J. Thomson proposed that the nucleus of an atom contains only nucleons. (b) A neutron is formed by an electron and a proton combining together. Therefore, it is neutral. (c) The mass ofan electron is about 2000 times that of proton. (d) An isotope of iodine is used for making tincture iodine, which is used as a medicine. Put tick ( ) against correct choice and cross (x) against wrong choice in questions 15, 16 and 17 Rutherford s alpha-particle scattering experiment was responsible for the discovery of (a) Atomic Nucleus (b) Electron (c) Proton (d) Neutron Isotopes of an element have (a) the same physical properties (b) different chemical properties (c) different number of neutrons (d) different atomic numbers.
