Helium atom has an atomic mass of 4 u and two protons in its nucleus. How many neutrons does it have? 4.3 Howare Electrons Distributed in Different Orbits (Shells)? The distribution of electrons into different orbits of an atom was suggested by Bohr and Bury. The following rules are followed for writing the number of electrons in different energy levels or shells: (i) The maximum number of electrons present in a shell is given by the Reprint 2025-26 formula 2n?, where n is the orbit number or energy level index, 1,2,3,.... Hence the maximum number of electrons in different shells are as follows: first orbit or K-shell will be = 2 x 17 = 2, second orbit or L-shell will be = 2 x 2?= 8, third orbit or M-shell will be = 2 x 37= 18, fourth orbit or N-shell will be = 2 x 4? = 32, and so on. (ii) The maximum number of electrons that can be accommodated in the outermost orbit is 8. (ii) Electrons are not accommodated in a given shell, unless the inner shells are filled. That is, the shells are filled in a step-wise manner. Atomic structure of the first eighteen elements is shown schematically in Fig. 4.4. ) H e The composition of atoms of the first eighteen elements is given in Table 4.1. uestions 1. Write the distribution of electrons in carbon and sodium atoms. 2. If K and L shells of an atom are full, then what would be the total number of electrons in the atom? 4.4 Valency We have learnt how the electrons in an atom are arranged in different shells/orbits. The electrons present in the outermost shell of an atom are known as the valence electrons. From the Bohr-Bury scheme, we also know that the outermost shell of an atom can () He 2H Fig.4.4: Schematic atomic structure of the first eighteen elements Activity e Make a static atomic model displaying electronic configuration of the first eighteen elements. accommodate a maximum of 8 electrons. It was observed that the atoms of elements, completely filled with 8 electrons in the outermost shell show little chemical activity. In other words, their combining capacity or valency is zero.
