What is meant by the term chemical formula? 4, Howmany atoms are present in a @ H,Smolecule and ii) PO, ion? 3.5 Molecular Mass In section 3.2.2 we discussed the concept of atomic mass. This concept can be extended to calculate molecular masses. The molecular mass of a substance is the sum of the atomic masses of all the atoms in a molecule of the substance. It is therefore the relative mass of a molecule expressed in atomic mass units (u). Example 3.1 (a) Calculate the relative molecular mass of water (H,O). (b) Calculate the molecular mass of HNO,. Solution: (a) Atomic mass of hydrogen = lu, oxygen = 16u So the molecular mass of water, which contains two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen is = 2x 1+1x16 = 18u (b) The molecular mass of HNO, = the atomic mass of H + the atomic mass of N+ 3 x the atomic mass of O =14+14+48=63u 3.5.1 FORMULA UNIT MASS The formula unit mass of a substance is a sum of the atomic masses of all atoms in a formula unit of a compound. Formula unit mass is calculated in the same manner as we calculate the molecular mass. The only difference is that SCIENCE Reprint 2025-26 we use the word formula unit for those uestions substances whose constituent particles are ions. For example, sodium chloride as 1. Calculate the molecular masses discussed above, has a formula unit NaCl. Its of H,, O, Cl, CO, CH, C,H, formula unit mass can be calculated as- C,H, NH,, CH,OH. 1x234+1x35.5=58.5u 2. Calculate the formula unit masses of ZnO, Na,O, K,CO,, Example 3.2 Calculate the formula unit given atomic masses of Zn = 65 u, mass of CaCl,. Na =23u, K=39u, C=12u, Solution: and O= 16 u. Atomic mass of Ca + (2 x atomic mass of Cl) =404+2x35.5=40+71=lllu you have learnt e During a chemical reaction, the sum of the masses of the reactants and products remains unchanged. This is known as the Law of Conservation of Mass. e In a pure chemical compound, elements are always present in a definite proportion by mass. This is known as the Law of Definite Proportions. e An atom is the smallest particle of the element that cannot usually exist independently and retain all its chemical properties. e A molecule is the smallest particle of an element or a compound capable of independent existence under ordinary conditions. It shows all the properties of the substance. e A chemical formula of
