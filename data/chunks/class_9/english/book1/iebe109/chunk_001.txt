you crawl. I want to know a few things, see. Youll soon stop being smart. I'll make you crawl. & 110 / Beehive Reprint 2025-26 vb # * GerraRD : Anything you like. I know all the answers. But before we begin I should like to change my position; you may be comfortable, but I am not. INTRUDER : Sit down there, and no funny business. (Motions to a chair, and seats himself on the divan by the bag.) Now then, we'll have a nice little talk about yourself! GerrarD : At last a sympathetic audience! I'll tell you the story of my life. How as a child I was stolen by the gypsies, and why at the age of thirty-two, I find myself in my lonely Essex cottage, how... InrRUDER : Keep it to yourself, and just answer my questions. You live here alone? Well, do you? GERRARD : I m sorry. I thought you were telling me, not asking me. A question of inflection; your voice is unfamiliar.

There s the baker and the greengrocer, of course; and then there s the milkman quite charming, but no one so interesting as yourself. INTRUDER : I happen to know that you never see tradespeople.
