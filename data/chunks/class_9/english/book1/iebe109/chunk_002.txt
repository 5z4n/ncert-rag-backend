Since you know so much about me, won t you say something about yourself? You have been so modest. I could tell you plenty. You think you re smart, but I m the top of the class round here. I ve got brains and I use them. That s how I ve got where I have. And where precisely have you got? It didn t require a great brain to break into my little cottage. When you know why I ve broken into your little cottage, you'll be surprised, and it won t be a pleasant surprise. With you figuring so largely in it, that is understandable. By the way, what particular line of crime do you embrace, or aren t you a specialist? My speciality s jewel robbery. Your car will do me a treat. It s certainly a dandy bus. I'm afraid jewels are few and far between in the wilds of Essex. So are the cops. I can retire here nicely for a little while. You mean to live with me? A trifle sudden isn t it; you ve not been invited. You won't be here long; so I didn t trouble to ask. What do you mean? This is your big surprise. I m going to kill you. A little harsh, isn t it? (with heavy sarcasm) Yeah, I'll be sorry to do it. I've taken a fancy to you, but it s just got to be done. Why add murder to your other crimes? It s a grave step you're taking. I'm not taking it for fun. I've been hunted long enough. I'm wanted for murder already, and they can t hang me twice. You're planning a gratuitous double, so to speak. Admitted you've nothing to lose, but what have you to gain? I've got freedom to gain. As for myself, I m a poor hunted rat. As Vincent Charles Gerrard I m free to go places and do nothing. I can eat well and sleep and without having to be ready to beat it at the sight of a cop. In most melodramas the villain is foolish enough to delay his killing long enough to be frustrated. You are much luckier.

I ve got a reason for everything. I m going to be Vincent Charles Gerrard, see. I ve got to know what he talks like. Now I know. That posh stuff comes easy. This is Mr V.C. Gerrard speaking. (Pantomime of phoning, in imitation cultured voice.) And that s not all. (He stands up.) Get up a minute (Gerrard stands.) Now take a look at me. You're not particularly decorative. No! Well, that goes for you,
