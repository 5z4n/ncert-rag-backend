these words create in your mind? Look at these words; ... peace comes dropping slow Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings What do these words mean to you? What do you think comes dropping slow...from the veils of the morning ? What does to where the cricket sings mean? Health is the greatest gift, contentment the greatest wealth, faithfulness the best relationship. GAUTAMA BUDDHA & The Lake Isle of Innisfree / 55 # Reprint 2025-26
