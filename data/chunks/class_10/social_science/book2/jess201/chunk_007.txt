1.3 gives the per capita income of Haryana, Kerala and Bihar. Actually, these figures are of Per Capita Net State Domestic Product at Current Prices for 2021-22. Let us ignore what this complicated term exactly means. Roughly, we can take it to be the per capita income of the state. We find that of the three, Haryana has the highest per capita INCOME AND OTHER CRITERIA TABLE 1.3 PER CAPITA INCOME OF SELECT STATES Per Capita Income for 2021-22 (in Rs) Source : Economic Survey 2020-21, P.A 29. income and Bihar is at the bottom. This means that, on an average, a person in Haryana earned Rs 2,64,729 in one year whereas, on an average, a person in Bihar earned only around Rs 47,500. So, if per capita income were to be used as the measure of development, Haryana will be considered the most developed and Bihar the least developed state of the three. Now, let us look at certain other data pertaining to these states given in Table 1.4. SOME COMPARATIVE DATA ON HARYANA, KERALA AND BIHAR Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births (2020) 2017-18 Literacy Rate % Net Attendance Ratio (per 100 persons) secondary stage (aged 15-17 years) 2017-18 Sources : Economic Survey 2023-24, National Sample Survey Organisation (Report No. 585), National Statistical Office, Government of India; National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) 2019-21 IIPS, Mumbai. Explanation of some of the terms used in this table: Infant Mortality Rate (or IMR) indicates the number of children that die before the age of one year as a proportion of 1000 live children born in that particular year. Literacy Rate measures the proportion of literate population in the 7-and-above age group.

The first column of the table shows that in Kerala, out of 1000 children born, 6 died before completing one year of age but in Haryana the proportion of children dying within one year of birth was 28, which is nearly three times more than that of Kerala. On the other hand, the per capita income of Haryana is more than that of Kerala as shown in Table 1.3. Just think of how dear you are to your parents, think of how every one is so happy when a child is born. Now, try to think of parents whose children die before they even celebrate their first birthday. How painful it must be to these parents? Next, note the year to which this data pertains. This was during 2018. So we are not talking of old times; it is 70 years after independence when our metro cities are full of high rise buildings and shopping malls! How is it that the average person in Haryana has more income than the average person in Kerala but
