can be built Reprint 2025-26 and maintained. The growing importance of road transport vis-a-vis rail transport is rooted in the following reasons; (a) construction cost of roads is much lower than that of railway lines, (b) roads can traverse comparatively more dissected and undulating topography, (c) roads can negotiate higher gradients of slopes and as such can traverse mountains such as the Himalayas, (d) road transport is economical in transportation of few persons and relatively smaller amount of goods over short distances, (e) it also provides doorto-door service, thus the cost of loading and unloading is much lower, (f) road transport is also used as a feeder to other modes of transport such as they provide a link between railway stations, air and sea ports. In India, roads are classified in the following six classes according to their capacity. Look at the map of the National Highways and find out about the significant role played by these roads. Golden Quadrilateral Super Highways: The government has launched a major road development project linking DelhiKolkata-Chennai-Mumbai and Delhi by six-lane Super Highways. The NorthSouth corridors linking Srinagar (Jammu & Kashmir) and Kanniyakumari (Tamil Nadu), and East-West Corridor connecting Silchar (Assam) and Porbander (Gujarat) are part of this project. The major objective of these Super Highways is to reduce the time and distance between the mega cities of India. These highway projects are being implemented by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI). e National Highways: National Highways link extreme parts of the country. These are the primary road systems. A number of major National Highways run in NorthSouth and East-West directions. e State Highways: Roads linking a state capital with different district headquarters are known as State Highways.

Under this scheme special provisions are made so that every village in the country is linked to a major town in the country by an all season motorable road. Border Roads: Apart from these, Border Roads Organisation a Government of India undertaking constructs and maintains roads in the bordering areas of the country. This organisation was established in 1960 for the development of the roads of strategic importance in the northern and north-eastern border areas. These roads have improved accessibility in areas of difficult terrain and have helped in the economic development of these area. a LE SL 68 E 72 76 80 84 88 92 96 E AFGHANISTAN , yey INDIA kal ] NATIONAL HIGHWAYS aa [Leh \Srnagar Fe de i Uri < Jami bale atnan Kull < ance id Sumdo wre
