This experiment suggests that hydrogen ions in HCl are produced in the presence of water. The separation of H* ion from HCl molecules cannot occur in the absence of water. HCl + H,O > H,O* + Cr Hydrogen ions cannot exist alone, but they exist after combining with water molecules. Thus hydrogen ions must always be shown as H*(aq) or hydronium ion (H,O*). H* +H,O ~H,O* We have seen that acids give H,O* or H*(aq) ion in water. Let us see what happens when a base is dissolved in water.

Figure 2.5 KOH(s) _H,0 _, K* (aq) + OH" (aq) Mg(OH),(s) _4#2 _, Mg?*(aq)+2O0H (aq) Bases generate hydroxide (OH) ions in water. Bases which are soluble in water are called alkalis. All bases do not dissolve in water. An alkali is a base that dissolves in water. They are soapy to touch, bitter and corrosive. Never taste or touch them as they may cause harm. Which of the bases in the Table 2.1 are alkalis? Now as we have identified that all acids generate H*(aq) and all bases generate OH (aq), we can view the neutralisation reaction as follows Acid + Base > Salt + Water H OH > MX + HOH H*(aq) + OH (aq) H,O()) Let us see what is involved when water is mixed with an acid or a base. Activity 2.10 = Take 10 mL water in a beaker. Add a few drops of concentrated H,SO, to it and swirl the beaker slowly. Touch the base of the beaker. Is there a change in temperature? Is this an exothermic or endothermic process? Repeat the above Activity with sodium hydroxide pellets and record your observations. Warning sign displayed on containers containing concentrated acids and bases The process of dissolving an acid or a base in water is a highly exothermic one. Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric acid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly to water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid, the heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns. The glass container
