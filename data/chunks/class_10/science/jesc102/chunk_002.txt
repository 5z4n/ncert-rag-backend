bubble filled Zinc granules with hydrogen [eXe) [o) Soap solution Figure 2.1 Reaction of zinc granules with dilute sulphuric acid and testing hydrogen gas by burning Acids, Bases and Salts 19 Reprint 2025-26 Note that the metal in the above reactions displaces hydrogen atoms from the acids as hydrogen gas and forms a compound called a salt. Thus, the reaction of a metal with an acid can be summarised as Acid + Metal > Salt + Hydrogen gas Can you now write the equations for the reactions you have observed? = Place a few pieces of granulated zinc metal in a test tube. = Add 2 mL of sodium hydroxide solution and warm the contents of the test tube. = Repeat the rest of the steps as in Activity 2.3 and record your observations. The reaction that takes place can be written as follows. 2NaOH{(aq) + Zn(s) > Na,ZnO,(s) + H,(g) (Sodium zincate) You find again that hydrogen is formed in the reaction. However, such reactions are not possible with all metals. 2.1.3 How do Metal Carbonates and Metal Hydrogencarbonates React with Acids? Thistle funnel Stand co = Take two test tubes, label them as A ork Delivery tube and B. Test tube = Take about 0.5 g of sodium carbonate (Na,CO,) in test tube A and about 0.5 g of sodium hydrogencarbonate Carbon dioxide gas (NaHCO,) in test tube B. Dilute Test tube = Add about 2 mL of dilute HCl to both hydrochloric Sglcigm the test tubes. acid , hydroxide What d bserve? Bul sodium solution at do you observe carbonate = Pass the gas produced in each case through lime water (calcium ee Figure 2.2 hydroxide solution) as shown in Passing carbon dioxide gas Fig. 2.2 and record your observations. through calcium hydroxide solution The reactions occurring in the above Activity are written as Test tube A: Na,CO,(s) + 2HCl(aq) ~ 2NaCl(aq) + H,O()) + CO, (g) Test tube B: NaHCO, (s) + HCl(aq) NaCl(aq) + H,O(l) + CO,(g) On passing the carbon dioxide gas evolved through lime water, Ca(OH), (aq) + CO,(g) ~ CaCO,(s) + H,O() (Lime water) (White precipitate) 20 Science Reprint 2025-26 On passing excess carbon dioxide the following reaction takes place: CaCO, (s)+ H,O() + CO,(g) Ca(HCO,), (aq) (Soluble in water) Limestone, chalk and marble are different forms of calcium carbonate. All metal carbonates and hydrogencarbonates react with acids to givea corresponding salt, carbon dioxide and water. Thus, the reaction can be summarised as Metal carbonate/Metal hydrogencarbonate + Acid Salt + Carbon dioxide + Water 2.1.4 How do Acids and Bases React with each other? = Take about 2 mL of dilute NaOH solution in a test tube and add two drops of phenolphthalein solution. What is the colour of the solution? Add dilute HCl solution to the above solution drop by drop. Is there any colour change for the reaction mixture? Why did the colour of phenolphthalein change after the addition of an acid? Now add a few drops of NaOH to
