The distance of the image from Direction of the pole of the mirror is called the image A incident light distance (uv). You already know that the distance of the principal focus from the pole Height as |, Distance towards is called the focal length (f). There is a (ive) the left (-ve) relationship between these three quantities __ P given by the mirror formula which is B expressed as Distance towards the right (+ve) Height 1 1 1 downwards ( ve) t= (9.1) vou =f M This formula is valid in all situations for all Mirror "] spherical mirrors for all positions of the N object. You must use the New Cartesian Sign Figure 9.9 Convention while substituting numerical The New Cartesian Sign Convention for spherical mirrors values for u, v, f, and Rin the mirror formula for solving problems. Magnification Magnification produced by a spherical mirror gives the relative extent to which the image of an object is magnified with respect to the object size. It is expressed as the ratio of the height of the image to the height of the object. It is usually represented by the letter m. If his the height of the object and h is the height of the image, then the magnification m produced by a spherical mirror is given by Height of the image (h ) ms Height of the object (h) h h m= (9.2) The magnification m is also related to the object distance (u) and image distance (vu). It can be expressed as: h D Magnification (m) = h =- 7 (9.3) You may note that the height of the object is taken to be positive as the object is usually placed above the principal axis. The height of the image should be taken as positive for virtual images. However, it is to be taken as negative for real images. A negative sign in the value of the magnification indicates that the image is real. A positive sign in the value of the magnification indicates that the image is virtual.
