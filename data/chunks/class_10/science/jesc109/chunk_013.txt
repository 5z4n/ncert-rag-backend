refractive index can be linked to an important physical quantity, the relative speed of propagation of light in different media. It turns out that light propagates with different speeds in different media. Light travels fastest in vacuum with speed of 3x10 ms". In air, the speed of light is only marginally less, compared to that in vacuum. It reduces considerably in glass or water. The value of the refractive index for a given pair of media depends upon the speed of light in the two media, as given below. Consider a ray of light travelling from medium 1 into medium 2, as shown in Fig.9.11. Let v, be the speed of light in medium 1 and v, be the speed of light in medium 2. The refractive index of medium 2 with respect to medium 1 is given by the ratio of the speed of light in medium 1 and the speed of light in medium 2. This is usually represented by the symbol n,,- This can be expressed in an equation form as ea 1 _ Speed of light in medium 1 _ v, (9.5) oe 21 Speed of light in medium 2 v, : (Glae By the same argument, the refractive index of medium 1 with respect to medium 2 is represented as n.,,. It is given by n= Speed of light in medium 2 _ v, (9.6) Figure 9.11 2 Speed of light in medium 1 u, : If medium 1 is vacuum or air, then the refractive index of medium 2 is considered with respect to vacuum. This is called the absolute refractive index of the medium. It is simply represented as n,. If c is the speed of 148 Science Reprint 2025-26 light in air and vis the speed of light in the medium, then, the refractive index of the medium n,, is given by Speed of light in air Cc n,, = a = (9.7) Speed of light in the medium vv The absolute refractive index of a medium is simply called its refractive index. The refractive index of several media is given in Table 9.3. From the Table you can know that the refractive index of water, n,, = 1.33. This means that the ratio of the speed of light in air and the speed of light in water is equal to 1.33. Similarly, the refractive index of crown glass, n, =1.52. Such data are helpful in many places. However, you need not memorise the data.

For example, kerosene having higher refractive index, is optically denser than water, although its mass density
