focal length (f). The lens formula is expressed as =A (9.8) The lens formula given above is general and is valid in all situations for any spherical lens. Take proper care of the signs of different quantities, while putting numerical values for solving problems relating to lenses. Light Reflection and Refraction 155 Reprint 2025-26 Magnification The magnification produced by a lens, similar to that for spherical mirrors, is defined as the ratio of the height of the image and the height of the object. Magnification is represented by the letter m. If h is the height of the object and h is the height of the image given by a lens, then the magnification produced by the lens is given by, _ Height of the Image _h = 9.9 Height of the object h (9.9) Magnification produced by a lens is also related to the object-distance u, and the image-distance v. This relationship is given by Magnification (m) = h /h=v/u (9.10) Example 9.3 A concave lens has focal length of 15 cm. At what distance should the object from the lens be placed so that it forms an image at 10 cm from the lens? Also, find the magnification produced by the lens. Solution Aconcave lens always forms a virtual, erect image on the same side of the object. Image-distance v = - 10cm; Focal length f = -15cm; Object-distance u ? 1 1 1 Since - => vou t lige uv f 1 1 1 1 1 + u -10 (-15) 10 15 1 -3+2 1 u 30 -30 or, u= 30cm Thus, the object-distance is 30 cm. Magnification m= v/u -10cm_ 1 M= = 35 - 30cm 3 The positive sign shows that the image is erect and virtual. The image is one-third of the size of the object. + 0.33 Example 9.4 A2.0 cm tall object is placed perpendicular to the principal axis ofa convex lens of focal length 10 cm. The distance of the object from the lens is 15 cm. Find the nature, position and size of the image. Also find its magnification. Science Reprint 2025-26 Solution Height of the objecth = +2.0cm; Focal length f = +10cm; object-distance u = -15cm; =? Image-distance v Height of the image h = ? 2 tid Since 7, uf or, = + u cle SIH 1 1 1 1 1 v (-15) 10 15 10 1 -2+3 = 1 v 30 30 or, v=+ 30cm The positive sign of vu shows that the image is formed at a distance of 30 cm on the other side of the optical centre. The image is real and inverted. Magnification m= rie gnificati hu or, h =h(v/u) Height of the image, h = (2.0) (+30/-15) =- 4.0 cm Magnification m= v/u +30cm or, m= _ =-2 -15cm The negative signs of m and h show that the image is inverted and real. It is formed below the principal axis. Thus, a real, inverted image, 4 cm tall, is formed
