They displace copper from its compounds. 1.2.4 Double Displacement Reaction = Take about 3 mL of sodium sulphate solution in a test tube. = In another test tube, take about 3 mL of barium chloride solution. = Mix the two solutions (Fig. 1.9). = What do you observe? Test tube containing solution of sodium sulphate Test tube containing solution You will observe that a white substance, which is of barium chloride insoluble in water, is formed. This insoluble substance formed is known as a precipitate. Any reaction that Figure 1.9 produces a precipitate can be called a precipitation reaction. Formation of barium sulphate and sodium Na,SO, (aq) + BaCl,(aq) - BaSO,(s) + 2NaCl(aq) (1.27) chloride (Sodium (Barium (Barium (Sodium sulphate) chloride) sulphate) chloride) Chemical Reactions and Equations 11 Reprint 2025-26 What causes this? The white precipitate of BaSO, is formed by the reaction of SO? and Ba *. The other product formed is sodium chloride which remains in the solution. Such reactions in which there is an exchange of ions between the reactants are called double displacement reactions. Recall Activity 1.2, where you have mixed the solutions of lead(II) nitrate and potassium iodide. (i) What was the colour of the precipitate formed? Can you name the compound precipitated? (ii) Write the balanced chemical equation for this reaction. (iii) Is this also a double displacement reaction? 1.2.5 Oxidation and Reduction China dish tivit 1.11] containing copper power Wire gauze = Heat a china dish containing about 1 g copper powder (Fig. 1.10). Tripod stand = What do you observe? Burner The surface of copper powder becomes coated with black copper(II) oxide. Why has this black substance formed? This is because oxygen is added to copper and copper oxide is formed. Figure 1.10 Oxidation of copper to 2Cu + O, _ Heat, 2CuO (1.28) copper oxide If hydrogen gas is passed over this heated material (CuO), the black coating on the surface turns brown as the reverse reaction takes place and copper is obtained. CuO +H, He@t 5 cu+H,O (1.29) If a substance gains oxygen during a reaction, it is said to be oxidised. If a substance loses oxygen during a reaction, it is said to be reduced. During this reaction (1.29), the copper(II) oxide is losing oxygen and is being reduced. The hydrogen is gaining oxygen and is being oxidised. In other words, one reactant gets oxidised while the other gets reduced during a reaction. Such reactions are called oxidation-reduction reactions or redox reactions.
