final ane in the name of the carbon chain is substituted by ene or yne as given in Table 4.4. For example, a three-carbon chain with a double bond would be called propene and if it has a triple bond, it would be called propyne.

Since most of the fuels we use are either carbon or its compounds, we shall first study combustion. 4.3.1 Combustion Carbon, in all its allotropic forms, burns in oxygen to give carbon dioxide along with the release of heat and light. Most carbon compounds also release a large amount of heat and light on burning. These are the oxidation reactions that you learnt about in the first Chapter (J) C+0O, >CO, + heat andlight (ii) CH, +O, CO, + H,O + heat and light (iii) CH,CH,OH + O, > CO, + H,O + heat and light Balance the latter two reactions like you learnt in the first Chapter. CAUTION: This Activity needs the teacher s assistance. = Light a bunsen burner and = Take some carbon compounds (naphthalene, adjust the air hole at the camphor, alcohol) one by one on a spatula and burn base to get different types of them. flames/presence of smoke. = Observe the nature of the flame and note whether = When do you get a yellow, smoke is produced. sooty flame? = Place a metal plate above the flame. Is there a deposition flame? on the plate in case of any of the compounds? : Saturated hydrocarbons will generally give a clean flame while unsaturated carbon compounds will give a yellow flame with lots of black smoke. This results in a
