Equation (11.21) gives the rate at which electric energy is dissipated or consumed in an electric circuit. This is also termed as electric power. The power P is given by P = VI Or P = PR=V /R (11.22) The SI unit of electric power is watt (W). It is the power consumed by a device that carries 1 A of current when operated at a potential difference of 1 V. Thus, 1W = lvoltx 1 ampere=1VA (11.23) The unit watt is very small. Therefore, in actual practice we use a much larger unit called kilowatt . It is equal to 1000 watts. Since electrical energy is the product of power and time, the unit of electric energy is, therefore, watt hour (W h). One watt hour is the energy consumed when 1 watt of power is used for 1 hour. The commercial unit of electric energy is kilowatt hour (kW h), commonly known as unit . 1kWh = 1000 watt x 3600 second = 3.6 10 watt second = 3.6X 10 joule (J) More to Know! Example 11.12 An electric bulb is connected to a 220 V generator. The current is 0.50 A. What is the power of the bulb? Solution P = VI = 220Vx0.50A = 110J/s = 110W. Example 11.13 An electric refrigerator rated 400 W operates 8 hour/day. What is the cost of the energy to operate it for 30 days at Rs 3.00 per kW h? Electricity Reprint 2025-26 Solution The total energy consumed by the refrigerator in 30 days would be 400 W x 8.0 hour/day x 30 days = 96000 W h =96kWh Thus the cost of energy to operate the refrigerator for 30 days is 96 kW h x Rs 3.00 per kW h = Rs 288.00 Q U ES TION S What determines the rate at which energy is delivered by a current? An electric motor takes 5 A from a 220 V line. Determine the power of the motor and the energy consumed in 2 h. What you have learnt A stream of electrons moving through a conductor constitutes an electric current. Conventionally, the direction of current is taken opposite to the direction of flow of electrons. The SI unit of electric current is ampere. To set the electrons in motion in an electric circuit, we use a cell or a battery. A cell generates a potential difference across its terminals. It is measured in volts (V). Resistance is a property that resists the flow of electrons in a conductor. It controls the magnitude of the current. The SI unit of resistance is ohm (Q). Ohm s law: The potential difference across the ends of a resistor is directly proportional to the current through it, provided its temperature remains the same. The resistance of a
