current I flowing through a resistor of resistance R. Let the potential difference across it be V (Fig. 11.13). Let tbe the time during which a charge @Q flows across. The work done in moving the charge Q through a potential difference Vis VQ. Therefore, the source must supply energy equal to VQ in time t. Hence the power input to the circuit by the source is paveevi (11.19) Or the energy supplied to the circuit by the source in time tis Px t, that is, Vit. What happens to this energy expended by the source? This energy gets dissipated in the resistor as heat. Thus for a steady current I, the amount of heat H produced in time tis H=VIt (11.20) 188 Science Reprint 2025-26 Applying Ohm s law [Eq. (11.5)], we get H=F Rt (11.21) This is known as Joule s law of heating. The law implies that heat produced in a resistor is (i) directly proportional to the square of current for a given resistance, (ii) directly proportional to resistance for a given current, and (iii) directly proportional to the time for which the current flows through the resistor. In practical situations, when an electric appliance is connected to a known voltage source, Eq. (11.21) is used after calculating the current through it, using the Figure 11.13 relation [= V/R. A steady current in a purely resistive electric circuit Example 11.10 An electric iron consumes energy at a rate of 840 W when heating is at the maximum rate and 360 W when the heating is at the minimum. The voltage is 220 V. What are the current and the resistance in each case? Solution From Eq. (11.19), we know that the power input is P=VI Thus the current I = P/V (a) When heating is at the maximum rate, I= 840 W/220 V = 3.82 A; and the resistance of the electric iron is R=V/I=220 V/3.82 A= 57.60 Q. (b) When heating is at the minimum rate, I= 360 W/220 V = 1.644; and the resistance of the electric iron is R=V/I=220 V/1.64 A= 134.15 Q. Example 11.11 100 J of heat is produced each second in a 4 Q resistance. Find the potential difference across the resistor. Solution H=100J, R=4Q0,t=1s, V=? From Eq. (11.21) we have the current through the resistor as I = \(H/Rd = v[1l00J/(4Qx1s)] = 5A Thus the potential difference across the resistor, V [from Eq. (11.5)] is V = IR = 5Ax4Q = 20V.
