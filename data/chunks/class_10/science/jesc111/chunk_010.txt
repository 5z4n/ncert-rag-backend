total resistance of the series circuit; it is equal to the sum of the two resistances. Q U ES TIO NS Draw a schematic diagram of a circuit consisting of a battery of three cells of 2 V each, a 5 Q resistor, an 8 Q resistor, and a 12 Q resistor, and a plug key, all connected in series. Redraw the circuit of Question 1, putting in an ammeter to measure the current through the resistors and a voltmeter,to measure the potential difference across the 12,Q,resistor. What would be the readings in the ammeter and the voltmeter? 11.6.2 Resistors in Parallel Now, let us consider the arrangement of three resistors joined in parallel with a combination of cells (or a battery), as shown in Fig.11.7. = Make a parallel combination, XY, of three resistors having resistances R,, R,, and R,, respectively. Connect it with a battery, a plug key and an ammeter, as shown in Fig. 11.10. Also connect a voltmeter in parallel with the combination of resistors. = Plug the key and note the ammeter reading. Let the current be I. Also take the voltmeter 1 reading. It gives the potential difference V, across the combination. The potential difference across each resistor is also V. This can be checked by connecting the voltmeter - K HHH- across each individual resistor (see . Fig. 11.11). Figure 11.10 Electricity 185 Reprint 2025-26 = Take out the plug from the key. Remove the ammeter and voltmeter from the circuit. Insert the ammeter in series with the resistor R,, as shown in Fig. 11.11. Note the ammeter reading, I,. Figure 11.11 = Similarly, measure the currents through R, and R,. Let these be I, and I,, respectively. What is the relationship between I, I,, I, and I,? 4) It is observed that the total current I, is equal to the sum of the separate currents through each branch of the combination. I=1, +L +1, (11.15) Let R, be the equivalent resistance of the parallel combination of resistors. By applying Ohm s law to the parallel combination of resistors, we have I=V/R, (11.16) On applying Ohm s law to each resistor, we have I=V/R; 1,=V/R,; and 1,=V/R, (11.17) From Eggs. (11.15) to (11.17), we have V/R, = V/R, # V/R, + V/R, or 1/R, =1/R,+1/R, + 1/R, (11.18) Thus, we may conclude that the reciprocal of the equivalent resistance of a group of resistances joined in parallel is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistances. Example 11.8 In the circuit diagram given in Fig. 11.10, suppose the resistors R,, R, and R, have the values 5 Q, 10 Q, 30 Q, respectively, which have been connected to a battery of 12 V. Calculate (a) the current through each resistor, (b) the total current in the circuit, and (c) the total circuit resistance. Solution R,=5 , R,= 10Q, and R, = 30 Q. Potential difference across the battery, V= 12 V. This is also the potential difference across each of
