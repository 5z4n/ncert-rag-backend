have shown that resistance of a uniform metallic conductor is directly proportional to its length (l) and inversely proportional to the area of cross-section (A). That is, Re l (11.8) and R 1l/A (11.9) Combining Eqs. (11.8) and (11.9) we get l eA l or, R=p7 (11.10) where p (rho) is a constant of proportionality and is called the electrical resistivity of the material of the conductor. The SI unit of resistivity is Qm. It is a characteristic property of the material. The metals and alloys Science Reprint 2025-26 have very low resistivity in the range of 1O Qmto 10 Qm. They are good conductors of electricity. Insulators like rubber and glass have resistivity of the order of 10? to 10'7 Q m. Both the resistance and resistivity of a material vary with temperature. Table 11.2 reveals that the resistivity of an alloy is generally higher than that of its constituent metals. Alloys do not oxidise (burn) readily at high temperatures. For this reason, they are commonly used in electrical heating devices, like electric iron, toasters etc. Tungsten is used almost exclusively for filaments of electric bulbs, whereas copper and aluminium are generally used for electrical transmission lines. Table 11.2 Electrical resistivity* of some substances at 20 C Material Resistivity (Q m) * You need not memorise these values. You can use these values for solving numerical problems. Example 11.3 (a) How much current will an electric bulb draw from a 220 V source, if the resistance of the bulb filament is 1200 Q? (b) How much current will an electric heater coil draw from a 220 V source, if the resistance of the heater coil is 100 Q? Solution (a) We are given V= 220 V; R= 1200 Q. From Eq. (12.6), we have the current I= 220 V/1200 0 =0.18A. (b) We are given, V= 220 V, R= 100 Q. From Eq. (11.6), we have the current I = 220 V/100 9 = 2.2 A. Note the difference of current drawn by an electric bulb and electric heater from the same 220 V source! Electricity 179 Reprint 2025-26 Example 11.4 The potential difference between the terminals of an electric heater is 60 V when it draws a current of 4 A from the source. What current will the heater draw if the potential difference is increased to 120 V? Solution We are given, potential difference V= 60 V, current I=4 A. According to Ohm s law, R = = oe =15Q, When the potential difference is increased to 120 V the current is given by < 120V og a. t=s= curren R 15Q The current through the heater becomes 8 A. Example 11.5 Resistance of a metal wire of length 1 m is 26 Q at 20 C. If the diameter of the wire is 0.3 mm, what will be the resistivity of the metal at that temperature? Using Table 11.2, predict the material of the wire. Solution We are given the resistance R of the wire =
