120 V the current is given by < 120V og a. t=s= curren R 15Q The current through the heater becomes 8 A. Example 11.5 Resistance of a metal wire of length 1 m is 26 Q at 20 C. If the diameter of the wire is 0.3 mm, what will be the resistivity of the metal at that temperature? Using Table 11.2, predict the material of the wire. Solution We are given the resistance R of the wire = 26 Q, the diameter d=0.3 mm =3 x 107m, and the length | of the wire = 1 m. Therefore, from Eq. (11.10), the resistivity of the given metallic wire is p = (RA/I) = (Rad?/4l) Substitution of values in this gives p = 184x10 Qm The resistivity of the metal at 20 C is 1.84 x 10 Q m. From Table 11.2, we see that this is the resistivity of manganese. Example 11.6 A wire of given material having length | and area of cross-section A has a resistance of 4 Q. What would be the resistance of another wire of the same material having length I/2 and area of cross-section 2A? Solution For first wire l R, =p =40 1 A Now for second wire _,l/2 1 l ay a P A R, = ~ R, R= 1 The resistance of the new wire is 10. Science Reprint 2025-26 Q U ES TION S$ On what factors does the resistance of a conductor depend? Will current flow more easily through a thick wire or a thin wire of the same material, when connected to the same source? Why? Let the resistance of an electrical component remains constant while the potential difference across the two ends of the component decreases to half of its former value. What change will occur in the current through it? Why are coils of electric toasters and electric irons made of an alloy rather than a pure metal? Use the data in Table 11.2 to answer the following (a) Which among iron and mercury is a better conductor? (b) Which material is the best conductor? 11.6 RESISTANCE OF A SYSTEM OF RESISTORS In preceding sections, we learnt about some simple electric circuits. We have noticed how the current through a conductor depends upon its resistance and the potential difference across its ends. In various electrical gadgets, we often use resistors in various combinations. We now therefore intend to see how Ohm s law can be applied to combinations of resistors. There are two methods of joining the resistors together. Figure 11.6 shows an electric circuit in which three resistors having resistances R_, R, and R,, respectively, are joined end to end. Here the resistors are said to be connected in series.

Here, the resistors are said to be connected in parallel. Figure 11.7 Resistors
