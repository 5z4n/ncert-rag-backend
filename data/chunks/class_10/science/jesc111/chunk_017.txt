V across the resistor are given below I(amperes) 0.5 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 V (volts) 1.6 3.4 6.7 10.2 PSr2 Plot a graph between V and I and calculate the resistance of that resistor. When a 12 V battery is connected across an unknown resistor, there is a current of 2.5 mA in the circuit. Find the value of the resistance of the resistor. A battery of 9 V is connected in series with resistors of 0.2 Q, 0.3 Q, 0.42 , 0.5 Q and 12 Q, respectively. How much current would flow through the 12 Q resistor? . How many 176 Q resistors (in parallel) are required to carry 5 A on a 220 V line? . Show how you would connect three resistors, each of resistance 6 , so that the combination has a resistance of (i) 9 Q, (ii) 4 .Q. Several electric bulbs designed to be used on a 220 V electric supply line, are rated 10 W. How many lamps can be connected in parallel with each other across the two wires of 220 V line if the maximum allowable current is 5 A? . Ahot plate of an electric oven connected to a 220 V line has two resistance coils A and B, each of 24 resistance, which may be used separately, in series, or in parallel. What are the currents in the three cases? Compare the power used in the 2 Q resistor in each of the following circuits: (i) a6 V battery in series with 1 Q and 2 Q resistors, and (ii) a 4 V battery in parallel with 12 Q and 2 Q resistors. Electricity 193 Reprint 2025-26 . Two lamps, one rated 100 W at 220 V, and the other 60 W at 220 V, are connected in parallel to electric mains supply. What current is drawn from the line if the supply voltage is 220 V? . Which uses more energy, a 250 WTV set in 1 hr, or a 1200 W toaster in 10 minutes? . An electric heater of resistance 44 draws 5 A from the service mains for 2 hours. Calculate the rate at which heat is developed in the heater. Explain the following. (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) Why is the tungsten used almost exclusively for filament of electric lamps? Why are the conductors of electric heating devices, such as bread-toasters and electric irons, made of an alloy rather than a pure metal? Why is the series arrangement not used for domestic circuits? How does the resistance of a wire vary with its area of cross-section? Why are copper and aluminium wires usually employed for electricity transmission? Science Reprint 2025-26
