and produces an electric current. In order to maintain the current in a given electric circuit, the cell has to expend its chemical energy stored in it. We define the electric potential difference between two points in an electric circuit carrying some current as the work done to move a unit charge from one point to the other Potential difference (V) between two points = Work done (W)/Charge (Q) Vv = wW/Q (11.2) The SI unit of electric potential difference is volt (V), named after Alessandro Volta (1745-1827), an Italian physicist. One volt is the potential difference between two points in a current carrying conductor when 1 joule of work is done to move a charge of 1 coulomb from one point to the other. 1 joule Therefore, | volt = _ 1 coulomb (11.3) 1V =lJC'! The potential difference is measured by means of an instrument called the voltmeter. The voltmeter is always connected in parallel across the points between which the potential difference is to be measured. Example 11.2 How much work is done in moving a charge of 2 C across two points having a potential difference 12 V? Solution The amount of charge Q, that flows between two points at potential difference V (= 12 V) is 2 C. Thus, the amount of work W, done in moving the charge [from Eq. (11.2)] is Electricity Reprint 2025-26 W = va 12Vx2C 24 J. Name a device that helps to maintain a potential difference across a conductor. What is meant by saying that the potential difference between two points is 1 V? How much energy is given to each coulomb of charge passing through a 6 V battery? 11.3 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM We know that an electric circuit, as shown in Fig. 11.1, comprises a cell (or a battery), a plug key, electrical component(s), and connecting wires. It is often convenient to draw a schematic diagram, in which different components of the circuit are represented by the symbols conveniently used. Conventional symbols used to represent some of the most commonly used electrical components are given in Table 11.1.
