we use a cell or a battery. A cell generates a potential difference across its terminals. It is measured in volts (V). Resistance is a property that resists the flow of electrons in a conductor. It controls the magnitude of the current. The SI unit of resistance is ohm (Q). Ohm s law: The potential difference across the ends of a resistor is directly proportional to the current through it, provided its temperature remains the same. The resistance of a conductor depends directly on its length, inversely on its area of cross-section, and also on the material of the conductor. The equivalent resistance of several resistors in series is equal to the sum of their individual resistances. A set of resistors connected in parallel has an equivalent resistance R, given by 1 1 1 1 R, R, R, Rs The electrical energy dissipated in a resistor is given by W=VxIxt The unit of power is watt (W). One watt of power is consumed when 1 A of current flows at a potential difference of 1 V. The commercial unit of electrical energy is kilowatt hour (kWh). 1 kW h = 8,600,000 J = 3.6 x 108 J. 192 Science Reprint 2025-26 A piece of wire of resistance R is cut into five equal parts. These parts are then connected in parallel. If the equivalent resistance of this combination is R% then the ratio R/R is (a) 1/25 (b) 1/5 (c) 5 (d) 25 Which of the following terms does not represent electrical power in a circuit?

A copper wire has diameter 0.5 mm and resistivity of 1.6 x 10 m. What will be the length of this wire to make its resistance 10 Q? How much does the resistance change if the diameter is doubled?
