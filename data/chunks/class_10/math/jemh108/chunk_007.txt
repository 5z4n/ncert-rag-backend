As Z A gets smaller and smaller, the length of the side BC decreases.The point C gets closer to point B, and finally when Z A becomes very close A ; B to 0 , AC becomes almost the same as AB (see Fig. 8.17).

Also, when Z A is very close to 0 , AC is nearly the AB same as AB and so the value of cos A= AC is very close to 1. This helps us to see how we can define the values of sin A and cos A when A= 0 . We define : sin 0 = 0 and cos 0 = 1. Using these, we have : sin 0 1 tan 0 = = 0, cot 0 = cos 0 tan 0 which is not defined. (Why?) sec 0 = = | and cosec 0 = e which is again not defined.(Why?) cos 0 sin Now, let us see what happens to the trigonometric ratios of Z A, when it is made larger and larger in A ABC till it becomes 90 . As Z A gets larger and larger, 7 C gets smaller and smaller. Therefore, as in the case above, the length of the side AB goes on decreasing. The point A gets closer to point B. Finally when Z A is very close to 90 , Z C becomes very close to 0 and the side AC almost coincides with side BC (see Fig. 8.18).
