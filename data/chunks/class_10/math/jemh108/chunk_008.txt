C becomes very close to 0 and the side AC almost coincides with side BC (see Fig. 8.18). Cc Cc c A B nar aed Sones ab Fig. 8.18 When Z C is very close to 0 , Z A is very close to 90 , side AC is nearly the same as side BC, and so sin A is very close to 1. Also when Z A is very close to 90 , Z Cis very close to 0 , and the side AB is nearly zero, so cos A is very close to 0. So, we define : sin 90 = 1 and cos 90 = 0. Now, why don t you find the other trigonometric ratios of 90 ? We shall now give the values of all the trigonometric ratios of 0 , 30 , 45 , 60 and 90 in Table 8.1, for ready reference. Reprint 2025-26 Not defined cosec A | Not defined Not defined Not defined From the table above you can observe that as Z A increases from 0 to 90 , sin A increases from 0 to 1 and cos A decreases from | to 0. Let us illustrate the use of the values in the table above through some examples. In A ABC, right-angled at B, A AB = 5 cm and Z ACB = 30 (see Fig. 8.19). Determine the lengths of the sides BC and AC. To find the length of the side BC, we will m choose the trigonometric ratio involving BC and the 30 given side AB. Since BC is the side adjacent to angle B c C and AB is the side opposite to angle C, therefore Bc. fn ; 5 5 1. ., BC tan 30 = B which gives BC = 5/3 cm Reprint 2025-26 126 MATHEMATICS To find the length of the side AC, we consider in 30 = AB Why? sin 30 = 4G (Why?) ,; PS i.e., 7 AC Le., AC = 10cm Note that alternatively we could have used Pythagoras theorem to determine the third side in the example above, 1. ., AC = ,/AB*+ BC? =/5 + (53) cm = 10cm. Example 7 : In A PQR, right-angled at Q (see Fig. 8.20), PQ= 3 cm and PR = 6 cm. P Determine Z QPR and Z PRQ. Solution : Given PQ = 3 cm and PR = 6 cm. em 6cm PQ, Therefore, PR sin R Q R Fig. 8.20 areal or sin 62 So, Z PRQ = 30 and therefore, Z QPR = 60 . (Why?) You may note that if one of the sides and any other part (either an acute angle or any side) of a right triangle is known, the remaining sides and angles of the triangle can be determined. 1 1 Example 8 : If sin (A- B) = 7 00s (A +B)= > 0 <A+B< 90 , A>B, findA and B. Solution : Since, sin (A B) = >? therefore, A B
