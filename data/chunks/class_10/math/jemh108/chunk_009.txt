30 and therefore, Z QPR = 60 . (Why?) You may note that if one of the sides and any other part (either an acute angle or any side) of a right triangle is known, the remaining sides and angles of the triangle can be determined. 1 1 Example 8 : If sin (A- B) = 7 00s (A +B)= > 0 <A+B< 90 , A>B, findA and B. Solution : Since, sin (A B) = >? therefore, A B =30 (Why?) (1) Also, since cos (A + B) = >? therefore, A+ B= 60 (Why?) (2) Solving (1) and (2), we get: A= 45 and B= 15 .

Similarly, an equation involving trigonometric ratios of an angle is called a trigonometric identity, if it is true for all values of the angle(s) involved. In this section, we will prove one trigonometric identity, and use it further to prove other useful Cc B trigonometric identities. Or, Le., Fig. 8.21 In A ABC, right-angled at B (see Fig. 8.21), we have: AB? + BC? = AC? (1) Dividing each term of (1) by AC , we get AB? BC? AC? + = AC* AC? AC? AB - BC) ( acy AC AC) (AC (cos A) + (sin A)? = 1 cos? A + sin? A = 1 (2) This is true for all A such that 0 < A < 90 . So, this is a trigonometric identity. Let us now divide (1) by AB . We get AB? BC? AC? + = AB*
