So, this is a trigonometric identity. Let us now divide (1) by AB . We get AB? BC? AC? + = AB* AB* ~~ AB? AB) (BC (Ac) AB AB) \AB 1+ tan A= sec? A (3) Is this equation true for A = 0 ? Yes, it is. What about A = 90 ? Well, tan A and sec A are not defined for A = 90 . So, (3) is true for all A such that 0 < A < 90 . Let us see what we get on dividing (1) by BC . We get AB? BC? = AC? 2 + 2 2 BC?

Therefore (4) is true for all A such that 0 <A< 90 . Using these identities, we can express each trigonometric ratio in terms of other trigonometric ratios, i.e., if any one of the ratios is known, we can also determine the values of other trigonometric ratios. Let us see how we can do this using these identities. Suppose we know that tan A= Be Then, cot A= /3. Since, sec? A= 1 + tan? A= 1+ ! 4 sec A= =, and cosA= 3 3 V3 Again, sin A= ,/I cos A =,/1- : = > Therefore, cosec A = 2. Example 9 : Express the ratios cos A, tan A and sec A in terms of sin A. Solution : Since cos? A + sin? A= 1, therefore, cos? A= 1 sin? A, i.e., cosA= +1 -sin?A This gives cosA= /l sin?A (Why?) sin A sin A 1 1 Hence, tan A = = and sec A = = cos A Hl sin? A cosA of] sin?
