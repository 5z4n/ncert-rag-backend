respect to its acute angles, called trigonometric ratios of the angle. We will restrict our discussion to acute angles only. However, these ratios can be extended to other angles also. We will also define the trigonometric ratios for angles of measure 0 and 90 . We will calculate trigonometric ratios for some specific angles and establish some identities involving these ratios, called trigonometric identities. 8.2 Trigonometric Ratios C In Section 8.1, you have seen some right triangles < imagined to be formed in different situations. oP Ss Let us take a right triangle ABC as shown oo: Hypotenuse ms in Fig. 8.4. = Here, Z CAB (or, in brief, angle A) is an 5 acute angle. Note the position of the side BC with respect to angle A. It faces Z A. We call it A B = the side opposite to angle A. AC is the Side adjacent to hypotenuse of the right triangle and the side AB angle A is a part of Z A. So, we call it the side adjacent to angle A.

We now define certain ratios ZU involving the sides of a right triangle, and call 7 E them trigonometric ratios. as The trigonometric ratios of the angle A A B in right triangle ABC (see Fig. 8.4) are defined Side opposite to as follows : angle C ; side opposite to angle A = BC Fig. 8.5 sine of ZA= = hypotenuse AC ; side adjacent to angle A AB cosine of Z A= = hypotenuse AC side opposite toangle A = BC tangent of Z A= : = side adjacent to angle A AB 1 hypotenuse AC cosecant of Z A= = - = sine of ZA side opposite to angle A BC 1 _ hypotenuse _ AC cosine of Z A side adjacent to angle A AB secant of Z A= 1 _ side adjacent to angle A AB cotangent of Z A= = : = tangent of Z A side opposite to angle A = BC The ratios defined above are abbreviated as sin A, cos A, tan A, cosec A, sec A and cot A respectively. Note that the ratios cosec A, sec A and cot A are respectively, the reciprocals of the ratios sin A, cos A and tan A. BC BC ac _ sinA cosA Also, observe that tan A = AB. AB cos A and cot A= sinA . AC So, the trigonometric ratios of an acute angle in a right triangle express the relationship between the angle and the length of its sides.
