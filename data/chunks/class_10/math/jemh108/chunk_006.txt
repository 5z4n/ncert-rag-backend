whether the following are true or false. Justify your answer. (i) The value of tan A is always less than 1. (ii) sec A= > for some value of angle A. (ii) cos A is the abbreviation used for the cosecant of angle A. (iv) cot A is the product of cot and A. (v) sin@= 3 for some angle 0. 8.3 Trigonometric Ratios of Some Specific Angles From geometry, you are already familiar with the construction of angles of 30 , 45 , 60 and 90 . In this section, we will find the values of the trigonometric ratios for these angles and, of course, for 0 . Reprint 2025-26 122 MATHEMATICS Trigonometric Ratios of 45 C InA ABC, right-angled at B, if one angle is 45 , then the other angle is also 45 , 1.e., Z A= Z C = 45 (see Fig. 8.14). So, BC =AB_ (Why?) Now, Suppose BC = AB = a. Then by Pythagoras Theorem, AC? = AB? + BC? = a? + a? = 2a , A B Fig. 8.14 and, therefore, AC = aV2 Using the definitions of the trigonometric ratios, we have : side opposite to angle 45 BC a _ 1 hypotenuse AC avy2 V2 sin 45 = side adjacent toangle 45 _ AB a 1 hypotenuse ~ AC ~ av2 V2 cos 45 = side opposite to angle 45 BC a tan 45 = - = = =]1 side adjacent to angle 45 AB a =~2, sec 45 = = 2 , cot 45 = =1 Al 45 = so, cosec 45 sin 45 cos 45 tan 45 Trigonometric Ratios of 30 and 60 Let us now calculate the trigonometric ratios of 30 [ and 60 . Consider an equilateral triangle ABC. Since each angle in an equilateral triangle is 60 , therefore, 30 ZA=ZB=2ZC=60 . Draw the perpendicular AD from A to the side BC phs0* Cc (see Fig. 8.15). D Now A ABD = AACD (Why?) Fig. 8.15 Therefore, BD = DC and Z BAD = Z CAD (CPCT) Now observe that: A ABD is aright triangle, right- angled at D with Z BAD = 30 and Z ABD = 60 (see Fig. 8.15). Reprint 2025-26 INTRODUCTION TO TRIGONOMETRY 123 As you know, for finding the trigonometric ratios, we need to know the lengths of the sides of the triangle. So, let us suppose that AB = 2a. Then, BD = a =a and AD? = AB? BD? = (2a) (a)? = 3a , Therefore, AD= ay3 Now, we have : sin 30 = BD c =! cos 30 = AD _ V3 _ v3 AB 2a 2 AB 2a 2 ,.
