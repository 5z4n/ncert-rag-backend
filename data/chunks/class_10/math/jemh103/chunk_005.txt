solution. Therefore, we cannot obtain a specific value of x. This situation has arisen because both the given equations are the same. Therefore, Equations (1) and (2) have infinitely many solutions. We cannot find a unique cost of a pencil and an eraser, because there are many common solutions, to the given situation. Example 7 : Two rails are represented by the equations x+2y -4=0Oand 2x+4y -12=0. Will the rails cross each other? Solution : The pair of linear equations formed were: x+2y-4=0 (1) 2x+4y-12= 0 (2) We express x in terms of y from Equation (1) to get x=4-2y Now, we substitute this value of x in Equation (2) to get 2(4 2y)+4y-12= 0 Reprint 2025-26 Pair OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWo VARIABLES 33 Le., 8 12=0 L.e., -4=0 which is a false statement. Therefore, the equations do not have a common solution. So, the two rails will not cross each other. EXERCISE 3.2 1. Solve the following pair of linear equations by the substitution method.

(i) The difference between two numbers is 26 and one number is three times the other. Find them. (ii we The larger of two supplementary angles exceeds the smaller by 18 degrees. Find them. we The coach of a cricket team buys 7 bats and 6 balls for 3800. Later, she buys 3 bats and 5 balls for = 1750. Find the cost of each bat and each ball. (iv) The taxi charges ina city consist ofa fixed charge together with the charge for the distance covered. For a distance of 10 km, the charge paid is = 105 and for a journey of 15 km, the charge paid is 155. What are the fixed charges and the charge per km? How much does a person have to pay for travelling a distance of 25 km? 9 A fraction becomes , if 2 is added to both the numerator and the denominator. (v a If, 3 is added to both the numerator and the denominator it becomes > . Find the fraction.

What are their present ages? 3.3.2 Elimination Method Now let us consider another method of eliminating (i.e., removing) one variable. This is sometimes more convenient than the substitution method. Let us see how this method works. Example 8 : The ratio of incomes of two persons
