an equation in one variable, i.e., in terms of x, which can be solved. Sometimes, as in Examples 9 and 10 below, you can get statements with no variable. If this statement is true, you can conclude that the pair of linear equations has infinitely many solutions. If the statement is false, then the pair of linear equations is inconsistent. Step 3: Substitute the value of x (or y) obtained in Step 2 in the equation used in Step 1 to obtain the value of the other variable. Remark : We have substituted the value of one variable by expressing it in terms of the other variable to solve the pair of linear equations. That is why the method is known as the substitution method. Example 5 : Solve the following question Aftab tells his daughter, Seven years ago, I was seven times as old as you were then. Also, three years from now, I shall be three times as old as you will be. (Isn t this interesting?) Represent this situation algebraically and graphically by the method of substitution. Solution : Let s and be the ages (in years) of Aftab and his daughter, respectively. Then, the pair of linear equations that represent the situation is s-7=7(t-7), Le. s 7t+42=0 (1) and s+3=3( +3), Le. s 3f=6 (2) Using Equation (2), we get s = 3t+ 6. Putting this value of s in Equation (1), we get (3t+ 6) - 7t+42= 0, 1.e., 4t= 48, which gives t= 12. Putting this value of in Equation (2), we get s= 3(12)+6=42 Reprint 2025-26 32 MATHEMATICS So, Aftab and his daughter are 42 and 12 years old, respectively. Verify this answer by checking if it satisfies the conditions of the given problems. Example 6: In a shop the cost of 2 pencils and 3 erasers is 9 and the cost of 4 pencils and 6 erasers is 18. Find the cost of each pencil and each eraser. Solution : The pair of linear equations formed were: 2x +3y=9 (1) 4x + 6y = 18 (2) We first express the value of x in terms of y from the equation 2x + 3y = 9, to get 9- 3y x= TG (3) Now we substitute this value of x in Equation (2), to get 49-3 a + 6y= 18 1. ., 18 - 6y + 6y = 18 Le., 18= 18 This statement is true for all values of y. However, we do not get a specific value of y as a solution. Therefore, we cannot obtain a specific value of x. This situation has arisen because both the given equations are the same. Therefore, Equations (1) and (2) have infinitely many solutions. We cannot find a unique cost of a pencil and an eraser, because there are many common solutions, to the given situation. Example 7 : Two rails are represented by the equations x+2y -4=0Oand 2x+4y -12=0. Will the rails cross each other? Solution : The pair of linear equations
