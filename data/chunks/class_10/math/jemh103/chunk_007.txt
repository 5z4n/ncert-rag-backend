numerically equal. Step 2 : Then add or subtract one equation from the other so that one variable gets eliminated. If you get an equation in one variable, go to Step 3. If in Step 2, we obtain a true statement involving no variable, then the original pair of equations has infinitely many solutions. If in Step 2, we obtain a false statement involving no variable, then the original pair of equations has no solution, i.e., it is inconsistent. Step 3 : Solve the equation in one variable (x or y) so obtained to get its value. Step 4 : Substitute this value of x (or y) in either of the original equations to get the value of the other variable. Now to illustrate it, we shall solve few more examples. Example 9 : Use elimination method to find all possible solutions of the following pair of linear equations : 2x + 3y = 8 (1) 4x+ 6y= 7 (2) Solution : Step 1 : Multiply Equation (1) by 2 and Equation (2) by 1 to make the coefficients of x equal. Then we get the equations as : 4x + 6y = 16 (3) 4x+ 6y= 7 (4) Step 2 : Subtracting Equation (4) from Equation (3), (4x 4x) + (6y 6y) = 16-7 1. ., 0 = 9, which is a false statement. Therefore, the pair of equations has no solution. Example 10 : The sum of a two-digit number and the number obtained by reversing the digits is 66. If the digits of the number differ by 2, find the number. How many such numbers are there? Reprint 2025-26 36 MATHEMATICS Solution : Let the ten s and the unit s digits in the first number be x and y, respectively. So, the first number may be written as 10x + y in the expanded form (for example, 56 = 10(5) + 6). When the digits are reversed, x becomes the unit s digit and y becomes the ten s digit. This number, in the expanded notation is 10y + x (for example, when 56 is reversed, we get 65 = 10(6) + 5). According to the given condition. (10x + y) + (10y + x) = 66 L.e., ll +y) = 66 L.e., x+y=6 (1) We are also given that the digits differ by 2, therefore, either x-y=2 (2) or y-x=2 (3) If x y = 2, then solving (1) and (2) by elimination, we get x =4 and y =2. In this case, we get the number 42. If y x = 2, then solving (1) and (3) by elimination, we getx =2 and y=4. In this case, we get the number 24. Thus, there are two such numbers 42 and 24. Verification : Here 42 + 24 = 66 and 4 2 = 2. Also 24 + 42 = 66 and 4-2 =2. EXERCISE 3.3 1. Solve the following pair of linear equations by the elimination method and the substitution method : (i) x+y=5
