solutions [dependent (consistent) pair of equations]. Consider the following three pairs of equations. (i) x - 2y =0 and 3x + 4y -20=0 (The lines intersect) (ii) 2x + 3y 9=O0 and 4x +6y 18=0 (The lines coincide) (it) x +2y 4=0 and 2x+4y 12=0 (The lines are parallel) ay b 2) and & in all the Let us now write down, and compare, the values of a a 2 2 2 three examples. Here, a,, b,, c, and a,, b,, c, denote the coefficents of equations given in the general form in Section 3.2. Reprint 2025-26 26 MATHEMATICS Table 3.1 From the table above, you can observe that if the lines represented by the equation axt+tby+c,=90 and ax+by+c,=0 are (i) intersecting, then A zl. a 5 wy ab (ii) coincident, then - = = . a, db Cy bh oc (ii) parallel, then AeA # . G4, O Cy In fact, the converse is also true for any pair of lines. You can verify them by considering some more examples by yourself. Let us now consider some more examples to illustrate it. Example 1 : Check graphically whether the pair of equations x+3y=6 (1) and 2x 3y = 12 (2) is consistent. If so, solve them graphically. Solution : Let us draw the graphs of the Equations (1) and (2). For this, we find two solutions of each of the equations, which are given in Table 3.2 Reprint 2025-26 Pair OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES 27 Table 3.2 Plot the points A(O, 2), B(6, 0), P(O, 4) and Q(3, 2) on graph A (0, paper, and join the points to form the lines AB and PQ as shown in Fig. 3.1. 1 We observe that there is a point B (6, 0) common to both the lines Erinn te ees Ee esaceosee eat aseeteeea aseaaeee tea AB and PQ. So, the solution of the ; pair of linear equations is x = 6 and y=0,i.e., the given pair of equations is consistent. Fig. 3.1 Example 2 : Graphically, find whether the following pair of equations has no solution, unique solution or infinitely many solutions: 5x-8y+1=0 (1) 3 24 P 0 2 Solution : Multiplying Equation (2) by 3 we get Sx-8y+1=0 But, this is the same as Equation (1). Hence the lines represented by Equations (1) and (2) are coincident. Therefore, Equations (1) and (2) have infinitely many solutions. Plot few points on the graph and verify it yourself. Example 3 : Champa went to a Sale to purchase some pants and skirts. When her friends asked her how many of each she had bought, she answered, The number of skirts is two less than twice the number of pants purchased. Also, the number of skirts is four less than four times the number of pants purchased . Help her friends to find how many pants and skirts Champa bought.
