The graphical method is not convenient in cases when the point representing the solution of the linear equations has non-integral coordinates like (V3, 27), 4] (-1.75, 3.3), fs 4) , etc. There is every possibility of making mistakes while reading such coordinates. Is there any alternative method of finding the solution? There are several algebraic methods, which we shall now discuss. 3.3.1 Substitution Method : We shall explain the method of substitution by taking some examples. Example 4 : Solve the following pair of equations by substitution method: 7x 15y = 2 (1) x+2y= 3 (2) Solution : Step 1 : We pick either of the equations and write one variable in terms of the other. Let us consider the Equation (2) : x+2y=3 and write it as x= 3-2y (3) Step 2 : Substitute the value of x in Equation (1). We get 73 2y)- 15y = 2 Le., 21-14y- 15y= 2 Le., 29y = -19 Therefore, y= 39 Step 3 : Substituting this value of y in Equation (3), we get 19 49 = 2} |= x= 3 (2 29 49 19 Therefore, the solution is x = 39 y= 39 . Reprint 2025-26 Pair OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES 31 49 19 Verification : Substituting x= 39 and y= 39 Youcan verify that both the Equations (1) and (2) are satisfied. To understand the substitution method more clearly, let us consider it stepwise: Step 1 : Find the value of one variable, say y in terms of the other variable, i.e., x from either equation, whichever is convenient. Step 2 : Substitute this value of y in the other equation, and reduce it to an equation in one variable, i.e., in terms of x, which can be solved. Sometimes, as in Examples 9 and 10 below, you can get statements with no variable. If this statement is true, you can conclude that the pair of linear equations has infinitely many solutions. If the statement is false, then the pair of linear equations is inconsistent. Step 3: Substitute the value of x (or y) obtained in Step 2 in the equation used in Step 1
