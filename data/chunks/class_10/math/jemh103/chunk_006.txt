What are their present ages? 3.3.2 Elimination Method Now let us consider another method of eliminating (i.e., removing) one variable. This is sometimes more convenient than the substitution method. Let us see how this method works. Example 8 : The ratio of incomes of two persons is 9 : 7 and the ratio of their expenditures is 4 : 3. If each of them manages to save % 2000 per month, find their monthly incomes. Solution : Let us denote the incomes of the two person by % 9x and % 7x and their expenditures by % 4y and & 3y respectively. Then the equations formed in the situation is given by: 9x 4y = 2000 (1) and 7x 3y = 2000 (2) Step 1 : Multiply Equation (1) by 3 and Equation (2) by 4 to make the coefficients of y equal. Then we get the equations: 27x 12y = 6000 (3) 28x 12y = 8000 (4) Step 2 : Subtract Equation (3) from Equation (4) to eliminate y, because the coefficients of y are the same. So, we get (28x 27x) (12y = 12v) = 8000-6000 i.e., x = 2000 Step 3 : Substituting this value of x in (1), we get 9(2000) 4v = 2000 i.e., y = 4000 So, the solution of the equations is x = 2000, y = 4000. Therefore, the monthly incomes of the persons are = 18,000 and % 14,000, respectively. Verification : 18000 : 14000 = 9 : 7. Also, the ratio of their expenditures = 18000 2000 : 14000 2000 = 16000 : 12000 = 4: 3 Remarks : 1. The method used in solving the example above is called the elimination method, because we eliminate one variable first, to get a linear equation in one variable. Reprint 2025-26 Pair OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES 35 In the example above, we eliminated y. We could also have eliminated x. Try doing it that way. 2. You could also have used the substitution, or graphical method, to solve this problem. Try doing so, and see which method is more convenient. Let us now note down these steps in the elimination method : Step 1 : First multiply both the equations by some suitable non-zero constants to make the coefficients of one variable (either x or y) numerically equal. Step 2 : Then add or subtract one equation from the other so that one variable gets eliminated. If you get an equation in one variable, go to Step 3. If in Step 2, we obtain a true statement involving no variable, then the original pair of equations has infinitely many solutions. If in Step 2, we obtain a false statement involving no variable, then the original pair of equations has no solution, i.e., it is inconsistent. Step
