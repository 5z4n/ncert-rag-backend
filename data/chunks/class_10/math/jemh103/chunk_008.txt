the number 42. If y x = 2, then solving (1) and (3) by elimination, we getx =2 and y=4. In this case, we get the number 24. Thus, there are two such numbers 42 and 24. Verification : Here 42 + 24 = 66 and 4 2 = 2. Also 24 + 42 = 66 and 4-2 =2. EXERCISE 3.3 1. Solve the following pair of linear equations by the elimination method and the substitution method : (i) x+y=5 and 2x-3y=4 (ii) 3x+4y=10 and 2x 2y=2 x 2 (ii) 3x-Sy 4=0 and 9x=2y+7 (iv) stp aclands-2=3 2. Form the pair of linear equations in the following problems, and find their solutions (if they exist) by the elimination method : (i) Ifwe add | to the numerator and subtract | from the denominator, a fraction reduces to 1. It becomes 5 if we only add | to the denominator. What is the fraction? (ii) Five years ago, Nuri was thrice as old as Sonu. Ten years later, Nuri will be twice as old as Sonu. How old are Nuri and Sonu? (iii) The sum of the digits of a two-digit number is 9. Also, nine times this number is twice the number obtained by reversing the order of the digits. Find the number.

Find how many notes of = 50 and 100 she received. (v) A lending library has a fixed charge for the first three days and an additional charge for each day thereafter. Saritha paid 27 for a book kept for seven days, while Susy paid % 21 for the book she kept for five days. Find the fixed charge and the charge for each extra day. 3.4 Summary In this chapter, you have studied the following points: 1. A pair of linear equations in two variables can be represented, and solved, by the: (i) graphical method (ii) algebraic method 2. Graphical Method : The graph of a pair of linear equations in two variables is represented by two lines. (i) If the lines intersect at a point, then that point gives the unique solution of the two equations. In this case, the pair of equations is consistent. (ii) Ifthe lines coincide, then there are infinitely many solutions each point on the line being a solution. In this case, the pair of equations is dependent (consistent). (ii) Ifthe lines are parallel, then the pair of equations has no solution. In this case, the pair of equations is inconsistent. 3. Algebraic Methods : We have discussed the following methods for finding the solution(s) of a pair of linear equations : (i) Substitution Method (ii) Elimination Method 4. Ifa pair of linear equations is given bya,x+by+c,=Oanda,x+b,y+c,=0, then the following situations can arise : , a 5 . . . oo.
