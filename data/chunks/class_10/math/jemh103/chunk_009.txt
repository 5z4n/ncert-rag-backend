case, the pair of equations is dependent (consistent). (ii) Ifthe lines are parallel, then the pair of equations has no solution. In this case, the pair of equations is inconsistent. 3. Algebraic Methods : We have discussed the following methods for finding the solution(s) of a pair of linear equations : (i) Substitution Method (ii) Elimination Method 4. Ifa pair of linear equations is given bya,x+by+c,=Oanda,x+b,y+c,=0, then the following situations can arise : , a 5 . . . oo. . (i) + #= : In this case, the pair of linear equations is consistent. ay l ~ GAL . . . . oo, . (ii) = _ # : In this case, the pair of linear equations is inconsistent. b a 9% & (ii) 1= += : In this case, the pair of linear equations is dependent and consistent. a, by, 5. There are several situations which can be mathematically represented by two equations that are not linear to start with. But we alter them so that they are reduced to a pair of linear equations.
