ratio). What about the converse of this statement? Is the converse true? In other words, if the sides of a triangle are respectively proportional to the sides of another triangle, is it true that their corresponding angles are equal? Let us examine it through an activity : Activity 5 : Draw two triangles ABC and DEF such that AB = 3 cm, BC = 6 cm, CA = 8 cm, DE = 4.5 cm, EF = 9 cm and FD = 12 cm (see Fig. 6.25). D A 8 cm 4.5 cm 12m 3cm B 6cm E 9cm F Fig. 6.25 g h AB _ BC _ CA h It 2 0, you have : DE EF. FD (each equal to 3 ) Now measure Z A, ZB, Z C, Z D, Z E and Z F. You will observe that ZA=Z2D,2ZB=ZEand 7C=ZF,ie., the corresponding angles of the two triangles are equal. You can repeat this activity by drawing several such triangles (having their sides in the same ratio). Everytime you shall see that their corresponding angles are equal. Itis due to the following criterion of similarity of two triangles: Theorem 6.4 : [f in two triangles, sides of one triangle are proportional to (i.e., in the same ratio of ) the sides of the other triangle, then their corresponding angles are equal and hence the two triangles are similiar. This criterion is referred to as the SSS (Side Side Side) similarity criterion for two triangles. This theorem can be proved by taking two triangles ABC and DEF such that AB BC_CA DE EF FD (< 1) (See Fig. 6.26): Reprint 2025-26 TRIANGLES 89 B C E F Fig. 6.26 Cut DP = AB and DQ = AC and join PQ. It b that pr = BR dP EF (How? can be seen tha PE QF and PQ || (How?) So, ZP=ZE and ZQ=ZF. DP DQ PQ Therefore, DE DF EF s DP DQ BC Why? DE DF EF Y ) So, BC = PQ (Why?) Thus, A ABC = A DPQ (Why ?) So, ZA=ZD, ZB=ZE and ZC=ZF_ (How ?) Remark : You may recall that either of the two conditions namely, (i) corresponding angles are equal and (11) corresponding sides are in the same ratio is not sufficient for two polygons to be similar. However, on the basis of Theorems 6.3 and 6.4, you can now Say that in case of similarity of the two triangles, it is not necessary to check both the conditions as one condition implies the other. Let us now recall the various criteria for congruency of two triangles learnt in Class IX. You may observe that SSS similarity criterion can be compared with the SSS congruency criterion. This suggests us to look for a similarity criterion comparable to SAS congruency criterion of triangles. For this, let us perform an activity. Activity 6 : Draw two triangles ABC and DEF such that AB = 2 cm, Z A = 50 , AC =4cm, DE=3
