You can repeat this activity by drawing any angle XAY of different measure and taking any number of equal parts on arms AX and AY . Each time, you will arrive at the same result. Thus, we obtain the following theorem, which is the converse of Theorem 6.1: Reprint 2025-26 82 MATHEMATICS Theorem 6.2 : Ifa line divides any two sides of a triangle in the same ratio, then the line is parallel to the third side. This theorem can be proved by taking a line DE such h AD _ AE d that DEi t llel that DB EC C an assuming a 1s not paralle to BC (see Fig. 6.12). If DE is not parallel to BC, draw a line DE parallel to BC. Fig. 6.12 S AD _ AE Why ? pB. EC (Why ) Theret AP AE why? erefore, EC EC (Why ?) Adding 1| to both sides of above, you can see that E and E must coincide. (Why ) Let us take some examples to illustrate the use of the above theorems. Example 1 : Ifa line intersects sides AB and AC of a AABC at D and E respectively di llel to BC, h AD _& Fig. 6.13 and 1s parallel to prove that _> AB ~ AC (see Fig. ).
