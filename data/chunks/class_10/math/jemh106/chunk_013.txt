Two figures having the same shape but not necessarily the same size are called similar figures. . All the congruent figures are similar but the converse is not true. . Two polygons of the same number of sides are similar, if (i) their corresponding angles are equal and (i1) their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (i.e., proportion). . Ifa line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle to intersect the other two sides in distinct points, then the other two sides are divided in the same ratio. . Ifaline divides any two sides of a triangle in the same ratio, then the line is parallel to the third side. . Ifintwo triangles, corresponding angles are equal, then their corresponding sides are in the same ratio and hence the two triangles are similar (AAA similarity criterion). . Ifintwo triangles, two angles of one triangle are respectively equal to the two angles of the other triangle, then the two triangles are similar (AA similarity criterion).

If in two triangles, corresponding sides are in the same ratio, then their corresponding angles are equal and hence the triangles are similar (SSS similarity criterion). 9.
