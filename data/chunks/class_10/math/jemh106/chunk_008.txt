TRIANGLES 87 Let rays BP and CQ intersect each other at A and rays ER and FS intersect each other at D. In the two triangles ABC and DEF, you can see that ZB=ZE,2ZC=ZF and Z A= Z D. That is, corresponding angles of these two triangles are equal. What can you say about their corresponding sides ? Note that BC 3 AB CA =~=06. <' 9 EF 5 What about DE and ED - On measuring AB, DE, CA and FD, you . AB CA . . will find that DE and Ep ae also equal to 0.6 (or nearly equal to 0.6, if there is some AB_BC_ CA in th t). Thus, - = = - You can repeat this activity b error in the measurement). Thus, DE EF FD p y by constructing several pairs of triangles having their corresponding angles equal. Every time, you will find that their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion). This activity leads us to the following criterion for similarity of two triangles. Theorem 6.3 : [fin two triangles, corresponding angles are equal, then their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion) and hence the two triangles are similar. D This criterion is referred to as the AAA (Angle Angle Angle) criterion of A similarity of two triangles. This theorem can be proved by taking two P Q triangles ABC and DEF such that F ZA=ZD,ZB=ZEandZC=ZF B cr (see Fig. 6.24) Fig. 6.24 Cut DP = AB and DQ = AC and join PQ. So, A ABC = A DPQ (Why ?) This gives ZB=ZP =ZE and PQ|| EF (How?) herefi DP PQ hy? Therefore, PE OF (Why?) | AB _ AC why? Le., DE DF (Why?) Similart AB BC d AB BC _ AC imilarly, De = pp 28489 De = Ep pr: Remark : If two angles of a triangle are respectively equal to two angles of another triangle, then by the angle sum property of a triangle their third angles will also be equal. Therefore, AAA similarity criterion can also be stated as follows: Reprint 2025-26 88 MATHEMATICS If two angles of one triangle are respectively equal to two angles of another triangle, then the two triangles are similar. This may be referred to as the AA similarity criterion for two triangles. You have seen above that if the three angles of one triangle are respectively equal to the three angles of another triangle, then their corresponding sides are proportional (i.e., in the same ratio). What about the converse of this statement? Is the converse true? In other words, if the sides of a triangle are respectively proportional to the sides of another triangle, is it true that their corresponding angles are equal? Let us examine it through an activity : Activity 5 : Draw two triangles ABC and DEF such that AB = 3 cm, BC = 6 cm, CA = 8 cm, DE = 4.5 cm, EF = 9 cm and FD
