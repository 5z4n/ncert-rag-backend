to BC to intersect AC at E. Do you observe from AD 3 Fig. 6.9 your constructions that DB = > ? Measure AE and AE AE . 3 EC. What about EC ? Observe that Ee | also equal to >: Thus, you can see that in A ABC, DE || BC and . Is ita coincidence? No, it is due to the following DB EC theorem (known as the Basic Proportionality Theorem): Reprint 2025-26 80 MATHEMATICS Theorem 6.1 : Ifa line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle to intersect the other two sides in distinct points, the other two sides are divided in the same ratio. Proof: We are given a triangle ABC in which a line parallel to side BC intersects other two sides AB and AC at D and E respectively (see Fig. 6.10). We need to prove that > = = e need to prove that DE = Ea: Let us join BE and CD and then draw DM L AC and EN 1 AB. Fig. 6.10 1 1 Now, area of A ADE (= 5 base x height) = 5 AD x EN. Recall from Class IX, that area of A ADE is denoted as ar(ADE). So, ar(ADE) = 5 AD x EN _ l Similarly, ar(BDE) = 5 DB x EN, 1 1 ar(ADE) = 5 AE x DM and ar(DEC) = 5 EC x DM. i ar(ADE) 7 SP*EN an Therefore, ar(BDE) T DB XEN = DB (1) l AE x DM d ar((ADE) 9 AE (2) an = = ar(DEC) 1 EC x DM EC Note that A BDE and DEC are on the same base DE and between the same parallels BC and DE. So, ar(BDE) = ar(DEC) (3) Reprint 2025-26 TRIANGLES 81 Therefore, from (1), (2) and (3), we have : AD _ AE DB EC Is the converse of this theorem also true (For the meaning of converse, see Appendix 1)? To examine this, let us perform the following activity: Activity 3: Draw an angle XAY on your notebook and on ray AX, mark points B,, B,, B,, B, and B such that AB, = B,B, = B,B, B,B, = B,B. Similarly, on ray AY, mark points C,, C,, C,, C, and C such that AC, = C,C, = C,C, = C,C, = C,C. Then join B,C, and BC (see Fig. 6.11). Fig) 6.11 AB, = AC, 1 BB CC (Each equal to q? Note that You can also see that lines B,C, and BC are parallel to each other, i.e., BC, || BC (1) Similarly, by joining B,C,, B,C, and B,C,, you can see that: ABa _ Af [-2) d B,C, || BC 2 BB Gc \ 3) am BGI @) AB, AC, - 3] i BB CC 7} an B,C, || BC (3) AB, AC, (_4 >. = a [7] and B,C, || BC (4) BB C,c \ 1 From (1), (2), (3) and (4), it can be observed that if a line
