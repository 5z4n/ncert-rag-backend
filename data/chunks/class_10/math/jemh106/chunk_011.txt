|| RS (Given) So, ZP=ZS (Alternate angles) and ZQ=ZR Also, Z POQ = Z SOR (Vertically opposite angles) Therefore, A POQ ~ A SOR (AAA similarity criterion) Example 5 : Observe Fig. 6.30 and then find 2 P. R A 613 7.6 Act B j Cc P D Q Fig. 6.30 Solution : In A ABC and A PQR, Reprint 2025-26 92 MATHEMATICS AB_38_1 BC_6_1 CA 3v3_1 RQ 76 2 QP 12 24 oR 6B 2 ; AB _BC_CA That is, RQ QP PR So, A ABC ~ A RQP (SSS similarity) Therefore, ZC=ZP (Corresponding angles of similar triangles) But ZC= 180 -ZA-ZB (Angle sum property) = 180 80 60 = 40 So, Z P= 40 Example 6: In Fig. 6.31, OA .OB= OC. OD. Show that ZA=2ZC andZB=ZD. Solution: OA.OB=OC.OD (Given) OA OD So, oc = OB (1) Fig. 6.31 B Also, we have ZAOD= ZCOB _ (Vertically opposite angles) (2) Therefore, from (1) and(2), AAOD~ ACOB _ (SAS similarity criterion) So, ZA=ZC andZD=2B (Corresponding angles of similar triangles) Example 7: A girl of height 90 cm is walking away from the base of a lamp-post at a speed of 1.2 m/s. Ifthe lamp is 3.6 m above the ground, find the length of her shadow after 4 seconds. Solution : Let AB denote the lamp-post and CD the girl after walking for 4 seconds away from the lamp-post (see Fig. 6.32). From the figure, you can see that DE is the shadow of the girl. Let DE be x metres. Reprint 2025-26 TRIANGLES 93 Now, BD = 1.2m x 4=4.8 m. Note that in A ABE and A CDE, ZB=ZD __ (Each is of 90 because lamp-post as well as the girl are standing vertical to the ground) and ZE=ZE (Same angle) So, A ABE ~ A CDE (AA similarity criterion) Therefore BE = AB DE CD i.e., A8hx _ 3.6 (90 cm = A m= 0.9 m) x 0.9 100 1. ., 48+x= 4x L.e., 3x = 48 1. ., x= 1.6 So, the shadow of the girl after walking for 4 seconds is 1.6 m long. Example 8 : In Fig. 6.33, CM and RN are Q N P respectively the medians of A ABC and A PQR. If A ABC ~ A PQR, prove that : A (i) AAMC ~ A PNR M .. CM _ AB @ ) RN PQ Cc B R (iii) A CMB ~ A RNQ . .

Solution : (4) A ABC ~ A PQR (Given) AB BC _CA So, PQ QR RP () and ZA=ZP, ZB=ZQandZC=ZR (2) But AB = 2 AM and PQ = 2 PN (As CM and RN are medians) 2AM CA So, from (1), PN = RP Reprint 2025-26 Le., Also, So, from (3) and (4), (ii) From (5), But Therefore, (iii) Again, Therefore, Also, Le., Therefore, MATHEMATICS CA RP (3) Z NPR [From (2)] (4) (SAS similarity) (5) CM CA RN RP CA AB RP > PO [From (1)] (7) CM
