hence the two triangles are similar (AAA similarity criterion). . Ifintwo triangles, two angles of one triangle are respectively equal to the two angles of the other triangle, then the two triangles are similar (AA similarity criterion). Reprint 2025-26 98 MATHEMATICS 8. If in two triangles, corresponding sides are in the same ratio, then their corresponding angles are equal and hence the triangles are similar (SSS similarity criterion). 9. If one angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of another triangle and the sides including these angles are in the same ratio (proportional), then the triangles are similar (SAS similarity criterion). A NOTE TO THE READER If in two right triangles, hypotenuse and one side of one triangle are proportional to the hypotenuse and one side of the other triangle, then the two triangles are similar. This may be referred to as the RHS Similarity Criterion. If you use this criterion in Example 2, Chapter 8, the proof will become simpler. Reprint 2025-26
