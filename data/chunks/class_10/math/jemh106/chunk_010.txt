implies the other. Let us now recall the various criteria for congruency of two triangles learnt in Class IX. You may observe that SSS similarity criterion can be compared with the SSS congruency criterion. This suggests us to look for a similarity criterion comparable to SAS congruency criterion of triangles. For this, let us perform an activity. Activity 6 : Draw two triangles ABC and DEF such that AB = 2 cm, Z A = 50 , AC =4cm, DE=3 cm, Z D = 50 and DF = 6 cm (see Fig.6.27). Reprint 2025-26 90 MATHEMATICS D A \> \> 4cm 6 cm 2cm 3cm C E F Fig. 6.27 AC 2 Here, you may observe that DF (each equal to 3) and Z A (included DE between the sides AB and AC) = Z D (included between the sides DE and DF). That is, one angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of another triangle and sides including these angles are in the same ratio (i.e., proportion). Now let us measure Z B, Z C, ZEand ZF. You will find that Z B= Z Eand Z C= ZF. Thatis, ZA= 2D, Z B= ZEand ZC=ZE. So, by AAA similarity criterion, A ABC ~ A DEF. You may repeat this activity by drawing several pairs of such triangles with one angle of a triangle equal to one angle of another triangle and the sides including these angles are proportional. Everytime, you will find that the triangles are similar. It is due to the following criterion of similarity of triangles: Theorem 6.5 : If one angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of the other triangle and the sides including these angles are proportional, then the two triangles are similar. This criterion is referred to as the SAS (Side Angle Side) similarity criterion for two triangles. A As before, this theorem can be proved by taking two triangles ABC and DEF = such that AB _ AC 7 B C rE F DE. DF (< l)and ZA=2ZD (see Fig. 6.28). Cut DP = AB, DQ Fig. 6.28 = AC and join PQ. Reprint 2025-26 TRIANGLES 91 Now, PQ || EF and A ABC = A DPQ (How ?) So, ZA=ZD, ZB=ZPandZC=2ZQ Therefore, A ABC ~ A DEF (Why?) We now take some examples to illustrate the use of these criteria. Example 4 : In Fig. 6.29, if PQ || RS, prove that A POQ ~ A SOR. R P O Q S Fig. 6.29 Solution : PQ || RS (Given) So, ZP=ZS (Alternate angles) and ZQ=ZR Also, Z POQ = Z SOR (Vertically opposite angles) Therefore, A POQ ~ A SOR (AAA similarity criterion) Example 5 : Observe Fig. 6.30 and then find 2 P.
