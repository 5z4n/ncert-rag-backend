either 2x -3 = 0 orx 1=0. Now, 2x 3 = 0 gives x=5 and x 1=0 gives x= 1. So, X= 5 and x = 1 are the solutions of the equation. In other words, 1 and 5 are the roots of the equation 2x? 5x +3=0. Verify that these are the roots of the given equation. Reprint 2025-26 QUADRATIC EQUATIONS 43 Note that we have found the roots of 2x? 5x + 3 = 0 by factorising 2x* 5x + 3 into two linear factors and equating each factor to zero. Example 4 : Find the roots of the quadratic equation 6x? x 2 = 0. Solution : We have 6x? x 2 = 6x? + 3x 4x 2 = 3x (2x + 1) -2 (2x + 1) = (3x 2)(2x + 1) The roots of 6x? x 2 = 0 are the values of x for which (3x 2)(2x + 1) =0 Therefore, 3x 2 = 0 or 2x + 1 =0, 1. . xXx= > or x=-z > 3 2 2 1 Therefore, the roots of 6x2 x 2 = 0 are 5 and 5 2 1 We verify the roots, by checking that 3 and ~,, satisfy 6x? -x-2=0. Example 5 : Find the roots of the quadratic equation 3x? 2./6x+2=0. Solution : 3x? 2./6x+2 = 3x? -J6x J6x+2 = V3x(V/3x - V2) - V2(/3x- V2) = (V3x- V2)(V3x-v2) So, the roots of the equation are the values of x for which (J3 x-V2)(V3x- V2) =0 Now, /3x /2 =0 for ve? So, this root is repeated twice, one for each repeated factor V3x J2 . Therefore, the roots of 3x? 2,/6x+2=0 are 2 , 2.

Solution : In Section 4.1, we found that if the breadth of the hall is x m, then x satisfies the equation 2x* + x 300 = 0. Applying the factorisation method, we write this equation as 2x? 24x + 25x 300 = 0 2x (x 12) +25 ( - 12) = 0 L.e., (x 12)(2x + 25) = 0 So, the roots of the given equation are x = 12 or x = 12.5. Since x is the breadth of the hall, it cannot be negative. Thus, the breadth of the hall is 12 m. Its length = 2x + 1 =25 m. EXERCISE 4.2 1.
