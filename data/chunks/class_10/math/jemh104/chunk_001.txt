2x + x 300 = 0 is a quadratic equation. Similarly, 2x? 3x + 1 = 0, 4x 3x? + 2 = 0 and 1 x* + 300 = 0 are also quadratic equations. In fact, any equation of the form p(x) = 0, where p(x) is a polynomial of degree 2, is a quadratic equation. But when we write the terms of p(x) in descending order of their degrees, then we get the standard form of the equation. That is, ax? + bx +c =0, a # 0 is called the standard form of a quadratic equation. Quadratic equations arise in several situations in the world around us and in different fields of mathematics. Let us consider a few examples. Example 1 : Represent the following situations mathematically: (i) John and Jivanti together have 45 marbles. Both of them lost 5 marbles each, and the product of the number of marbles they now have is 124. We would like to find out how many marbles they had to start with. (ii) A cottage industry produces a certain number of toys in a day. The cost of production of each toy (in rupees) was found to be 55 minus the number of toys produced in a day. On a particular day, the total cost of production was % 750. We would like to find out the number of toys produced on that day. Solution : (i) Let the number of marbles John had be x. Then the number of marbles Jivanti had = 45 x (Why ?). The number of marbles left with John, when he lost 5 marbles = x 5 The number of marbles left with Jivanti, when she lost 5 marbles = 45 x 5 = 40-x Reprint 2025-26 40 MATHEMATICS Therefore, their product = (x 5) (40 x) = 40x x? 200 + 5x = x?+ 45x 200 So, x? + 45x 200 = 124 (Given that product = 124) ie, 2 +45x-324=0 i.e., x? 45x + 324 = 0 Therefore, the number of marbles John had, satisfies the quadratic equation x? 45x + 324 = 0 which is the required representation of the problem mathematically. (ii) Let the number of toys produced on that day be x. Therefore, the cost of production (in rupees) of each toy that day = 55 x So, the total cost of production (in rupees) that day = x (55 x) Therefore, x (55 x) = 750 L.e., 55x x* = 750 i.e., x?+ 55x 750 = 0 L.e., x? 55x + 750 = 0 Therefore, the number of toys produced that day satisfies the quadratic equation x 55x + 750 = 0 which is the required representation of the problem mathematically. Example 2 : Check whether the following are quadratic equations: (i) @-2)+1=2x-3 (ii) x(x + 1) + 8 =(x + 2) (X-2) (iii) x (2x + 3)=x2+1 (iv) (x +2 =3 4 Solution : (i) LHS=(@@- 2+ 1=.2?- 4 +441=x2- 4x45 Therefore, (x 2)?+ 1 = 2x 3
