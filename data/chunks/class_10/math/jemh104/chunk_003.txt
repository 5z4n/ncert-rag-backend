more than twice its breadth. We need to find the length and breadth of the plot. Reprint 2025-26 42 MATHEMATICS (ii) The product of two consecutive positive integers is 306. We need to find the integers. (ii) Rohan s mother is 26 years older than him. The product of their ages (in years) 3 years from now will be 360. We would like to find Rohan s present age. (iv) A train travels a distance of 480 km at a uniform speed. If the speed had been 8 km/h less, then it would have taken 3 hours more to cover the same distance. We need to find the speed of the train. 4.3 Solution of a Quadratic Equation by Factorisation Consider the quadratic equation 2x? 3x + 1 = 0. If we replace x by 1 on the LHS of this equation, we get (2 x 1 ) (3 x 1) + 1 = 0 = RHS of the equation. We say that | is a root of the quadratic equation 2x? 3x + 1 = 0. This also means that 1 is a zero of the quadratic polynomial 2x? 3x + 1. In general, a real number is called a root of the quadratic equation ax + bx +c=0,a40ifao +ba+c=0. We also say that x = a is a solution of the quadratic equation, or that o satisfies the quadratic equation. Note that the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial ax? + bx + c and the roots of the quadratic equation ax + bx + c= 0 are the same. You have observed, in Chapter 2, that a quadratic polynomial can have at most two zeroes. So, any quadratic equation can have atmost two roots. You have learnt in Class IX, how to factorise quadratic polynomials by splitting their middle terms. We shall use this knowledge for finding the roots of a quadratic equation. Let us see how. Example 3 : Find the roots of the equation 2x* 5x + 3 = 0, by factorisation. Solution : Let us first split the middle term 5x as 2x 3x [because ( 2x) x ( 3x) = 6x? = (2x ) x 3]. So, 2x? 5x +3 = 2x? 2x -3x+3 = 2x (x- 1) -3@- 1) = (2x 3)(x- 1) Now, 2x? 5x + 3 = 0 can be rewritten as (2x 3)(x 1) = 0. So, the values of x for which 2x? 5x + 3 = 0 are the same for which (2x 3)(x 1) = 0, i.e., either 2x -3 = 0 orx 1=0. Now, 2x 3 = 0 gives x=5 and x 1=0 gives x= 1. So, X= 5 and x = 1 are the solutions of the equation. In other words, 1 and 5 are the roots of the equation 2x? 5x +3=0. Verify that these are the roots of the given equation.
