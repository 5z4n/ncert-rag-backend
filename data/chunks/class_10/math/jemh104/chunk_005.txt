Acottage industry produces a certain number of pottery articles in a day. It was observed on a particular day that the cost of production of each article (in rupees) was 3 more than twice the number of articles produced on that day. If the total cost of production on that day was % 90, find the number of articles produced and the cost of each article. 4.4 Nature of Roots The equation ax + bx + c = 0 are given by b+ \b- 4ac a 2a i. Vb? -4 If b? 4ac > 0, we get two distinct real roots b + ae a 2a b Jb? 4ac 2a 2a and Reprint 2025-26 QUADRATIC EQUATIONS 45 b 2 = = - +0, ie, x =- or If b? 4ac = 0, then x Da , x Da Da b So, the roots of the equation ax? + bx + c = 0 are both oa a Therefore, we say that the quadratic equation ax + bx + c = 0 has two equal real roots in this case. If 6? 4ac < 0, then there is no real number whose square is b? 4ac. Therefore, there are no real roots for the given quadratic equation in this case. Since b? 4ac determines whether the quadratic equation ax + bx + c = 0 has real roots or not, b? 4ac is called the discriminant of this quadratic equation. So, a quadratic equation ax* + bx + c =0 has (i) two distinct real roots, if b? 4ac > 0, (ii) two equal real roots, if b? 4ac = 0, (iii) no real roots, if b? 4ac < 0. Let us consider some examples. Example 7: Find the discriminant of the quadratic equation 2x? 4x + 3 = 0, and hence find the nature of its roots. Solution : The given equation is of the form ax + bx + c= 0, where a = 2, b= 4 and c= 3. Therefore, the discriminant b? 4ac = ( 4)?- (4x 2 x 3)=16-24=-8 <0 So, the given equation has no real roots. Example 8 : A pole has to be erected at a point on the boundary of a circular park of diameter 13 metres in such a way that the differences of its distances from two diametrically opposite fixed gates A and B on the boundary is 7 metres. Is it possible to do so? If yes, at what distances from the two gates should the es be erected? Solution : Let us first draw the
