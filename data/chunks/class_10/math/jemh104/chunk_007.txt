Is the following situation possible? If so, determine their present ages. The sum of the ages of two friends is 20 years. Four years ago, the product of their ages in years was 48. . Isit possible to design a rectangular park of perimeter 80 m and area 400 m?? If so, find its length and breadth. 4.5 Summary In this chapter, you have studied the following points: 1. A quadratic equation in the variable x is of the form ax + bx + c=0, where a, b, care real numbers and a # 0. . A real number is said to be a root of the quadratic equation ax? + bx + c = 0, if ao + ba+c=0. The zeroes of the quadratic polynomial ax? + bx + c and the roots of the quadratic equation ax? + bx + c=0 are the same. . Ifwe can factorise ax + bx +c, a#0, into a product of two linear factors, then the roots of the quadratic equation ax + bx + c= 0 can be found by equating each factor to zero. . Quadratic formula: The roots of a quadratic equation ax? + bx + c= 0 are given by q q g b+\b? 4ac , provided b* 4ac 2 0. 2a . A quadratic equation ax? + bx + c= 0 has (i) two distinct real roots, if b - 4ac> 0, (ii) two equal roots (i.e., coincident roots), if b> - 4ac = 0, and (ii) no real roots, if b?- 4ac <0.
