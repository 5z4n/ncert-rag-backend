equation has no real roots. Example 8 : A pole has to be erected at a point on the boundary of a circular park of diameter 13 metres in such a way that the differences of its distances from two diametrically opposite fixed gates A and B on the boundary is 7 metres. Is it possible to do so? If yes, at what distances from the two gates should the es be erected? Solution : Let us first draw the diagram (see Fig. 4.2). Let P be the required location of the pole. Let the distance of the pole from the gate B be x m, i.e., BP = x m. Now the difference of the distances of the pole from the two gates = AP BP (or, BP AP) = 7m. Therefore, AP = (x + 7) m. Reprint 2025-26 46 MATHEMATICS Now, AB = 13m, and since AB is a diameter, ZAPB = 90 (Why?) Therefore, AP? + PB? = AB? (By Pythagoras theorem) i.e., (x +7)? +x = 13? L.e., x? + 14x +49+x?= 169 i.e., 2x + 14x 120 = 0 So, the distance x of the pole from gate B satisfies the equation x + 7x 60 = 0 So, it would be possible to place the pole if this equation has real roots. To see if this is so or not, let us consider its discriminant. The discriminant is b? 4ac = 7? 4 x 1 x ( 60) = 289>0. So, the given quadratic equation has two real roots, and it is possible to erect the pole on the boundary of the park. Solving the quadratic equation x? + 7x 60 = 0, by the quadratic formula, we get _ -7+ 289 | -7+17 2 2 Therefore, x = 5 or 12. Since x is the distance between the pole and the gate B, it must be positive. Therefore, x = 12 will have to be ignored. So, x = 5. Thus, the pole has to be erected on the boundary of the park at a distance of 5m from the gate B and 12m from the gate A. Example 9 : Find the discriminant of the equation 3x? 2x + 37 0 and hence find the nature of its roots. Find them, if they are real. Solution : Here a = 3, b = 2 and cas. Therefore, discriminant b* 4ac = ( 2)?- 4.x 3 x 3 4-4=0. Hence, the given quadratic equation has two equal real roots.
