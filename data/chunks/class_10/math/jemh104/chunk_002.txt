55x + 750 = 0 Therefore, the number of toys produced that day satisfies the quadratic equation x 55x + 750 = 0 which is the required representation of the problem mathematically. Example 2 : Check whether the following are quadratic equations: (i) @-2)+1=2x-3 (ii) x(x + 1) + 8 =(x + 2) (X-2) (iii) x (2x + 3)=x2+1 (iv) (x +2 =3 4 Solution : (i) LHS=(@@- 2+ 1=.2?- 4 +441=x2- 4x45 Therefore, (x 2)?+ 1 = 2x 3 can be rewritten as x 4x +5 = 2x-3 i.e., x- 6x+8=0 It is of the form ax? + bx + c=0. Therefore, the given equation is a quadratic equation. Reprint 2025-26 QUADRATIC EQUATIONS 41 (ii) Since x(x + 1) +8 =x? +x+ 8 and (x + 2)(x 2) =x? -4 Therefore, xrP+x+8=x7-4 1. ., x+12=0 It is not of the form ax? + bx + c= 0. Therefore, the given equation is not a quadratic equation. (it) Here, LHS = x (2x + 3) = 2x? + 3x So, x (2x + 3) = x? + 1 can be rewritten as 2x + 3x = 2x? 4+1 Therefore, we get x +3x-1=0 It is of the form ax? + bx +c = 0. So, the given equation is a quadratic equation. (iv) Here, LHS = (x + 2)? = x3 + 6x? + 12x +8 Therefore, (x + 2) = x 4 can be rewritten as x3 + 6x? + 12x+8=x3-4 i.e., 6x +12x+12=0 or, x+2x+2=0 It is of the form ax? + bx + c= 0. So, the given equation is a quadratic equation. Remark : Be careful! In (ii) above, the given equation appears to be a quadratic equation, but it is not a quadratic equation. In (iv) above, the given equation appears to be a cubic equation (an equation of degree 3) and not a quadratic equation. But it turns out to be a quadratic equation. As you can see, often we need to simplify the given equation before deciding whether it is quadratic or not. EXERCISE 4.1 1. Check whether the following are quadratic equations : (i) (x+1)?=2(x-3) (ii) x 2x =( 2) (3 -x) (iil) (X-2)(x+ 1)=(x- 1)(@x+3) (iv) (x 3)(2x +1) =x(x+5) (v) (2x-1)@-3)=( +5)(x- 1) (vi) x +3x+1=(x-2) (vii) (x +2) = 2x (x?-1) (viii) x - 4x? -x + 1=(x-2) 2. Represent the following situations in the form of quadratic equations : (i) The area of a rectangular plot is 528 m?. The length of the plot (in metres) is one more than twice its breadth. We need to find the length and breadth of the plot. Reprint 2025-26 42 MATHEMATICS (ii) The product of two consecutive positive integers is 306. We need to find the integers. (ii) Rohan s mother is 26 years older than him. The product of their ages (in years) 3 years from now will be 360. We would like to find Rohan s present age. (iv) A train travels a distance of 480 km at a
