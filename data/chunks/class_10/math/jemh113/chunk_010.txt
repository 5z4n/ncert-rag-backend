Here 0, 10, 20, . . ., 90 give the lower limits of the respective class intervals. Now, to find the median of grouped data, we can make use of any of these cumulative frequency distributions. Let us combine Tables 13.12 and 13.13 to get Table 13.15 given below: Table 13.15 Number of students (f) Cumulative frequency (cf) 3 3 4 9 8 Now in a grouped data, we may not be able to find the middle observation by looking at the cumulative frequencies as the middle observation will be some value in Reprint 2025-26 STATISTICS 193 a class interval. It is, therefore, necessary to find the value inside a class that divides the whole distribution into two halves. But which class should this be? n 5: We now locate the class whose cumulative frequency is greater than (and nearest to) To find this class, we find the cumulative frequencies of all the classes and n n : This is called the median class. In the distribution above, n = 53. So, > = 26.5. Now 60 70 is the class whose cumulative frequency 29 is greater than (and nearest to) ie, 26.5 0) >be. 5. Therefore, 60 70 is the median class. After finding the median class, we use the following formula for calculating the median. -cf n Median= / + 2 xh, where != lower limit of median class, n= number of observations, cf = cumulative frequency of class preceding the median class, f= frequency of median class, h= class size (assuming class size to be equal). . . n Substituting the values on. 26.5, 1= 60, cf = 22, f=7, h= 10 in the formula above, we get Median = 60 + [ASS] x 10 = 60+ * = 66.4 So, about half the students have scored marks less than 66.4, and the other half have scored marks more than 66.4. Reprint 2025-26 A survey regarding the heights (in cm) of 51 girls of Class X of a school was conducted and the following data was obtained: Height (in cm) Number of girls 11 Less than 140 Less than 145 Less than 150 29 Less than 155 40 Less than 160 Less than 165 Find the median height. To calculate the median height, we need to find the class intervals and their corresponding frequencies. The given distribution being of the /ess than type, 140, 145, 150,..., 165 give the upper limits of the corresponding class intervals. So, the classes should be below 140, 140 - 145, 145 - 150, .. ., 160. - 165. Observe that from the given distribution, we find that there are 4 girls with
