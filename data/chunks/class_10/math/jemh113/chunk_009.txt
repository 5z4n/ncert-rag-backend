observaton is 28 (Why?) 51st observation is 29 28 + 29 So, Median = = 28.5 Remark : The part of Table 13.11 consisting Column | and Column 3 is known as Cumulative Frequency Table. The median marks 28.5 conveys the information that about 50% students obtained marks less than 28.5 and another 50% students obtained marks more than 28.5. Now, let us see how to obtain the median of grouped data, through the following situation. Consider a grouped frequency distribution of marks obtained, out of 100, by 53 students, in a certain examination, as follows: Table 13.12 From the table above, try to answer the following questions: How many students have scored marks less than 10? The answer is clearly 5. Reprint 2025-26 STATISTICS 191 How many students have scored less than 20 marks? Observe that the number of students who have scored less than 20 include the number of students who have scored marks from 0 - 10 as well as the number of students who have scored marks from 10 - 20. So, the total number of students with marks less than 20 is 5 + 3, i.e., 8. We say that the cumulative frequency of the class 10-20 is 8. Similarly, we can compute the cumulative frequencies of the other classes, i.e., the number of students with marks less than 30, less than 40, . . ., less than 100. We give them in Table 13.13 given below: Table 13.13 The distribution given above is called the cumulative frequency distribution of the less than type. Here 10, 20, 30, .. . 100, are the upper limits of the respective class intervals. We can similarly make the table for the number of students with scores, more than or equal to 0, more than or equal to 10, more than or equal to 20, and so on. From Table 13.12, we observe that all 53 students have scored marks more than or equal to 0. Since there are 5 students scoring marks in the interval 0 - 10, this means that there are 53 5 = 48 students getting more than or equal to 10 marks. Continuing in the same manner, we get the number of students scoring 20 or above as 48 3 = 45, 30 or above as 45 4 = 41, and so on, as shown in Table 13.14. Reprint 2025-26 Table 13.14 Marks obtained Number of students (Cumulative frequency) More than or equal to 0 More than or equal to 10 More than or equal to 20 More than or equal to 30 More than or equal to 40 More than or equal to 50 More than or equal to 60 More than or equal to 70 More than or equal to 80 More than or equal to 90 The table above is called a cumulative frequency distribution of the more than type. Here 0, 10, 20, . . ., 90 give the lower limits of the respective class intervals. Now, to find the
