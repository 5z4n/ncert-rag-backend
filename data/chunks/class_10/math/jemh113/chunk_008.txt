Find the modal monthly expenditure of the families. Also, find the mean monthly expenditure : Reprint 2025-26 4. The following distribution gives the state-wise teacher-student ratio in higher secondary schools of India. Find the mode and mean of this data. Interpret the two measures. Number of students per teacher Number of states /U.T. 5. The given distribution shows the number of runs scored by some top batsmen of the world in one-day international cricket matches. 3000 - 4000 4000 - 5000 5000 - 6000 6000 - 7000 7000 - 8000 8000 - 9000 9000 - 10000 10000 - 11000 Find the mode of the data. 6. A student noted the number of cars passing through a spot on a road for 100 periods each of 3 minutes and summarised it in the table given below. Find the mode of the data : Number of cars 10-20} 20-30] 30-40} 40-50 | 50-60} 60-70] 70-80 row [>t *foleta{als Reprint 2025-26 188 MATHEMATICS 13.4 Median of Grouped Data As you have studied in Class IX, the median is a measure of central tendency which gives the value of the middle-most observation in the data. Recall that for finding the median of ungrouped data, we first arrange the data values of the observations in n+1 ascending order. Then, if 7 is odd, the median is the ae) th observation. And, ifn is even, then the median will be the average of the sth and the [s + 7 th observations. Suppose, we have to find the median of the following data, which gives the marks, out of 50, obtained by 100 students in a test : First, we arrange the marks in ascending order and prepare a frequency table as follows: Table 13.9 Reprint 2025-26 Here 1 = 100, which is even. The median will be the average of the 5th and the G + i observations, i.e., the 50th and 5lst observations. To find these observations, we proceed as follows: Table 13.10 Marks obtained Number of students 6 + 20 = 26 26 + 24=50 50+ 28=78 78 + 15=93 93 ++4=97 97+2=99 99+ 1=100 Now we add another column depicting this information to the frequency table above and name it as cumulative frequency column. Table 13.11 Marks obtained Number of students Cumulative frequency 20 Reprint 2025-26 190 MATHEMATICS From the table above, we see that: 50th observaton is 28 (Why?) 51st observation is 29 28 + 29 So, Median = = 28.5 Remark : The part of Table 13.11 consisting Column | and Column 3 is known as Cumulative Frequency Table. The median marks 28.5 conveys the information that about 50% students obtained marks less than 28.5 and another 50% students obtained marks more than 28.5. Now, let us see how to obtain the median of grouped data, through the following situation. Consider a grouped frequency
