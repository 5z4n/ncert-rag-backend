The lengths of 40 leaves of a plant are measured correct to the nearest millimetre, and the data obtained is represented in the following table : Length (in mm) Number of leaves 118 - 126 127-135 136 - 144 145 - 153 154-162 163-171 172-180 Find the median length of the leaves. (Hint : The data needs to be converted to continuous classes for finding the median, since the formula assumes continuous classes. The classes then change to 117.5 - 126.5, 126.5 - 135.5, ..., 171.5 - 180.5.) Reprint 2025-26 200 MATHEMATICS 5. The following table gives the distribution of the life time of 400 neon lamps : Find the median life time of a lamp. 6. 100 surnames were randomly picked up from a local telephone directory and the frequency distribution of the number of letters in the English alphabets in the surnames was obtained as follows: Determine the median number of letters in the surnames. Find the mean number of letters in the surnames? Also, find the modal size of the surnames. 7. The distribution below gives the weights of 30 students of a class. Find the median weight of the students. 13.5 Summary In this chapter, you have studied the following points: 1. The mean for grouped data can be found by : LHX. i (i) the direct method: x = z _ Lhd, (ii) the assumed mean method : x = a + Yi Reprint 2025-26 STATISTICS 201 fu, (ii) the step deviation method : =a+ [2 xh, i with the assumption that the frequency of a class is centred at its mid-point, called its class mark. 2. The mode for grouped data can be found by using the formula: Mode= /+| f= to J 2h to ~ fh where symbols have their usual meanings. 3. The cumulative frequency ofa class is the frequency obtained by adding the frequencies of all the classes preceding the given class. 4. The median for grouped data is formed by using the formula: of 2 xh Median = / + ; f where symbols have their usual meanings. A NOTE TO THE READER For calculating mode and median for grouped data, it should be ensured that the class intervals are continuous before applying the formulae. Same condition also apply for construction of an ogive. Further, in case of ogives, the scale may not be the same on both the axes. Reprint 2025-26
