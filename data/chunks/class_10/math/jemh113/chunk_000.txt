1062CH14 STATISTICS 13.1 Introduction In Class IX, you have studied the classification of given data into ungrouped as well as grouped frequency distributions. You have also learnt to represent the data pictorially in the form of various graphs such as bar graphs, histograms (including those of varying widths) and frequency polygons. In fact, you went a step further by studying certain numerical representatives of the ungrouped data, also called measures of central tendency, namely, mean, median and mode. In this chapter, we shall extend the study of these three measures, i.e., mean, median and mode from ungrouped data to that of grouped data. We shall also discuss the concept of cumulative frequency, the cumulative frequency distribution and how to draw cumulative frequency curves, called ogives. 13.2 Mean of Grouped Data The mean (or average) of observations, as we know, is the sum of the values of all the observations divided by the total number of observations. From Class IX, recall that if XX)... X, are observations with respective frequencies f,, f,, ..., f, then this means observation x, occurs f, times, x, occurs f, times, and so on. Now, the sum of the values of all the observations = fix, +fx,+...+fx,, and the number of observations =f, +f,+...+f. So, the mean x of the data is given by y= AX + foxy Fo FSX Rt heo ds, Recall that we can write this in short form by using the Greek letter X (capital sigma) which means summation. That is, Reprint 2025-26 Xx; Lf i which, more briefly, is written as = , if itis understood that 7 varies from 1 ton. Let us apply this formula to find the mean in the following example. The marks obtained by 30 students of Class X of a certain school in a Mathematics paper consisting of 100 marks are presented in table below. Find the mean of the marks obtained by the students.

So, let us put them in a column as shown in Table 13.1.

In most of our real life situations, data is usually so large that to make a meaningful study it needs to be condensed as grouped data. So, we need to convert given ungrouped data into grouped data and devise some method to find its mean. Let us convert the ungrouped data of Example | into grouped data by forming class-intervals of width, say 15. Remember that, while allocating frequencies to each class-interval, students falling in any upper class-limit would be considered in the
