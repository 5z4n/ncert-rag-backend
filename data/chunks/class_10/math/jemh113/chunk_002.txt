f, becomes tedious and time consuming. So, for such situations, let us think of a method of reducing these calculations. We can do nothing with the fs, but we can change each x, to a smaller number so that our calculations become easy. How do we do this? What about subtracting a fixed number from each of these x, s? Let us try this method. The first step is to choose one among the x s as the assumed mean, and denote it by a . Also, to further reduce our calculation work, we may take a to be that x, which lies in the centre of x,, x,,...,.x,. So, we can choose a = 47.5 or a = 62.5. Let us choose a = 47.5. The next step is to find the difference d, between a and each of the x, s, that is, the deviation of a from each of the x, s. 1.., d,= x,-a=x, 47.5 Reprint 2025-26 STATISTICS 175 The third step is to find the product of d, with the corresponding f,, and take the sum of all the f,d, s. The calculations are shown in Table 13.4. Table 13.4 4 Yfd. So, from Table 13.4, the mean of the deviations, d = > a Now, let us find the relation between d and X. Since in obtaining d,, we subtracted a from each x,, so, in order to get the mean , we need to add a to d . This can be explained mathematically as: Fa Yfd. Mean of deviations, d= ava = Uf. (x, - a So, d= i = @) Lf 2fixX; Ufa Oxf, ODF Lf. = Fatt fi =x-a So, XY=at+d Yf.d. ve = a+ ih Reprint 2025-26 176 MATHEMATICS Substituting the values of a, Ufd, and Xf, from Table 13.4, we get X= 415.42 =475+145=62. Therefore, the mean of the marks obtained by the students is 62. The method discussed above is called the Assumed Mean Method. Activity 1 : From the Table 13.3 find the mean by taking each of x, (i.e., 17.5, 32.5, and so on) as a . What do you observe? You will find that the mean determined in each case is the same, i.e., 62. (Why ?) So, we can say that the value of the mean obtained does not depend on the choice of a . Observe that in Table 13.4, the values in Column 4 are all multiples of 15. So, if we divide the values in the entire Column 4 by 15, we would get smaller numbers to multiply with f. (Here, 15 is the class size of each class interval.) Xj a , where a is the assumed mean and / is the class size. So, let u, = Now, we calculate u, in this way and continue as before (i.e., find fu, and then Xfu,). Taking h = 15, let us form Table 13.5. Table 13.5 Yfu; Xfi Here, again let us find the relation between w and x.
