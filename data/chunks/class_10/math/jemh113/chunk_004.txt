the assumed mean method, Using the direct method, x = X= at Ud; = ids = 50 + <= 39.71 i Using the step-deviation method, x= at| |) xh =50+/ 9 ) x10=39.71 Xf, 35 Therefore, the mean percentage of female teachers in the primary schools of rural areas is 39.71. Remark : The result obtained by all the three methods is the same. So the choice of method to be used depends on the numerical values of x, and f. If x, and f, are sufficiently small, then the direct method is an appropriate choice. If x, and f, are numerically large numbers, then we can go for the assumed mean method or step-deviation method. If the class sizes are unequal, and x, are large numerically, we can still apply the step-deviation method by taking / to be a suitable divisor of all the d, s. Reprint 2025-26 The distribution below shows the number of wickets taken by bowlers in one-day cricket matches. Find the mean number of wickets by choosing a suitable method. What does the mean signify? Number of 20-60 | 60-100} 100-150] 150-250] 250 - 350 | 350 - 450 wickets Number of bowlers Here, the class size varies, and the x,s are large. Let us still apply the stepdeviation method with a = 200 and h = 20. Then, we obtain the data as in Table 13.8. Number of Number of wickets bowlers taken (f) 20 - 60 60 - 100 100 - 150 150 - 250 250 - 350 350 - 450 So, w= =. Therefore, x = 200+ 20( 3 45 = 200 47.11 = 152.89. This tells us that, on an average, the number of wickets taken by these 45 bowlers in one-day cricket is 152.89. Now, let us see how well you can apply the concepts discussed in this section! Reprint 2025-26 STATISTICS 181 Activity 2 : Divide the students of your class into three groups and ask each group to do one of the following activities. 1. Collect the marks obtained by all the students of your class in Mathematics in the latest examination conducted by your school. Forma grouped frequency distribution of the data obtained. 2. Collect the daily maximum temperatures recorded for a period of 30 days in your city. Present this data as a grouped frequency table. 3. Measure the heights of all the students of your class (in cm) and form a grouped frequency distribution table of this data. After all the groups have collected the data and formed grouped frequency distribution tables, the groups should find the mean in each case by the method which they find appropriate. EXERCISE 13.1 1. Asurvey was conducted by a group of students as a part of their environment awareness programme, in which they collected the following data regarding the number of plants in 20 houses in a locality. Find the mean number of plants per house. Which method did you use for finding the mean, and why? 2.
