modal class = 2. Now, let us substitute these values in the formula : Reprint 2025-26 STATISTICS 185 Mode = 1+ f= to J 2hi- fo fy = 34+ 8-7 x 2=347=3.286 2x8-7-2 7 Therefore, the mode of the data above is 3.286. Example 6 : The marks distribution of 30 students in a mathematics examination are given in Table 13.3 of Example 1. Find the mode of this data. Also compare and interpret the mode and the mean. Solution : Refer to Table 13.3 of Example 1. Since the maximum number of students (i.e., 7) have got marks in the interval 40 - 55, the modal class is 40 - 55. Therefore, the lower limit (/) of the modal class = 40, the class size (A) = 15, the frequency (f,) of modal class = 7, the frequency (f,) of the class preceding the modal class = 3, the frequency (f,) of the class succeeding the modal class = 6. Now, using the formula: Mode = (oh Joa, 7-3 14-6-3 we get Mode = son }. 15 =52 So, the mode marks is 52. Now, from Example 1, you know that the mean marks is 62. So, the maximum number of students obtained 52 marks, while on an average a student obtained 62 marks. Remarks : 1. In Example 6, the mode is less than the mean. But for some other problems it may be equal or more than the mean also. 2. It depends upon the demand of the situation whether we are interested in finding the average marks obtained by the students or the average of the marks obtained by most Reprint 2025-26 186 MATHEMATICS of the students. In the first situation, the mean is required and in the second situation, the mode is required. Activity 3 : Continuing with the same groups as formed in Activity 2 and the situations assigned to the groups. Ask each group to find the mode of the data. They should also compare this with the mean, and interpret the meaning of both. Remark : The mode can also be calculated for grouped data with unequal class sizes. However, we shall not be discussing it. EXERCISE 13.2 1. The following table shows the ages of the patients admitted in a hospital during a year: Find the mode and the mean of the data given above. Compare and interpret the two measures of central tendency. 2. The following data gives the information on the observed lifetimes (in hours) of 225 electrical components : Determine the modal lifetimes of the components. 3. The following data gives the distribution of total monthly household expenditure of 200 families of a village. Find the modal monthly expenditure of the families. Also, find the mean monthly expenditure : Reprint 2025-26 4. The following distribution gives the state-wise teacher-student ratio in higher secondary schools of India. Find the mode and mean of this data. Interpret the two measures. Number of students per teacher Number of states /U.T. 5.
