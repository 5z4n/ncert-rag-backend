Less than 160 Less than 165 Find the median height. To calculate the median height, we need to find the class intervals and their corresponding frequencies. The given distribution being of the /ess than type, 140, 145, 150,..., 165 give the upper limits of the corresponding class intervals. So, the classes should be below 140, 140 - 145, 145 - 150, .. ., 160. - 165. Observe that from the given distribution, we find that there are 4 girls with height less than 140, 1.e., the frequency of class interval below 140 is 4. Now, there are 11 girls with heights less than 145 and 4 girls with height less than 140. Therefore, the number of girls with height in the interval 140 - 145 is 11 -4 = 7. Similarly, the frequency of 145 - 150 is 29 11 = 18, for 150 - 155, it is 40 29 = 11, and so on. So, our frequency distribution table with the given cumulative frequencies becomes: Table 13.16 Class intervals Cumulative frequency Below 140 4 140 - 145 7 145 - 150 18 150-155 155 - 160 160 - 165 Reprint 2025-26 STATISTICS 195 n_ 51 . oa. Now n=51.So, ae 25.5. This observation lies in the class 145 - 150. Then, 1 (the lower limit) = 145, cf (the cumulative frequency of the class preceding 145 - 150) = 11, f (the frequency of the median class 145 - 150) = 18, h (the class size) = 5. - cf Using the formula, Median = / + xh, we have Median = 145+ (A *) x5 145 Ca 149.03 = +g = 149.03. So, the median height of the girls is 149.03 cm. This means that the height of about 50% of the girls is less than this height, and 50% are taller than this height. Example 8 : The median of the following data is 525. Find the values of x and y, if the total frequency is 100. Reprint 2025-26 196 MATHEMATICS Solution : It is given that n = 100 So, 76+x+y=100, ie, x+y=24 (1) The median is 525, which lies in the class 500 600 So, /=500, f=20, cf=36+x, h=100 ne cf Using the formula : Median = / + h, we get 525 = 500+( 22 = 3 =* |x 100 Le., 525 500 = (14 x) x 5 Le., 25 = 70 5x Le., 5x = 70-25 =45 So, x=9 Therefore, from (1), we get 9+y= 24 Le., y= 15 Reprint 2025-26 STATISTICS 197 Now, that you have studied about all the three measures of central tendency, let us discuss which measure would be best suited for a particular requirement. The mean is the most frequently used measure of central tendency because it takes into account all the observations, and lies between the extremes, 1.e., the largest and the smallest observations of the entire data. It also enables us to compare two or more distributions. For example, by comparing the average (mean) results
