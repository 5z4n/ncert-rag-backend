15, we would get smaller numbers to multiply with f. (Here, 15 is the class size of each class interval.) Xj a , where a is the assumed mean and / is the class size. So, let u, = Now, we calculate u, in this way and continue as before (i.e., find fu, and then Xfu,). Taking h = 15, let us form Table 13.5. Table 13.5 Yfu; Xfi Here, again let us find the relation between w and x. Let u = Reprint 2025-26 STATISTICS 177 X,-a We have, u= i h (x, - a) xf, 7 Therefore, a= nh _ 1 | fix; af yf; h xf; 1) Xf;x; aii ht Sy, yf, 1,_ = |xX-a Me So, hu =xX-a Le., Xx=athu So ra a+ 2) Now, substituting the values of a, h, Xfu, and Xf, from Table 14.5, we get ee 415 415x({2) = 47.5+14.5=62 So, the mean marks obtained by a student is 62. The method discussed above is called the Step-deviation method. We note that : e the step-deviation method will be convenient to apply if all the d,s have a common factor. e The mean obtained by all the three methods is the same. e The assumed mean method and step-deviation method are just simplified forms of the direct method. e The formula =a+ hu still holds ifa and / are not as given above, but are a x; any non-zero numbers such that u, = Let us apply these methods in another example.
