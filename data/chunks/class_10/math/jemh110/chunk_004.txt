The lengths of tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal. Proof : We are given a circle with centre O, a point P lying outside the circle and two tangents PQ, PR on the circle from P (see Fig. 10.7). We are required to prove that PQ = PR. For this, we join OP, OQ and OR. Then Z OQP and Z ORP are right angles, because these are angles between the radii and tangents, and according to Theorem 10.1 they are right angles. Now in right triangles OQP and ORP, OQ = OR OP = OP Therefore, A OQP = A ORP This gives PQ = PR Remarks 1. The theorem can also be proved by using the Pythagoras Theorem as follows: R Fig. 10.7 (Radii of the same circle) PQ? = OP? OQ? = OP? OR? = PR? (As OQ = OR) which gives PQ = PR. (Common) (RHS) (CPCT) 2. Note also that Z OPQ = Z OPR. Therefore, OP is the angle bisector of Z QPR, i.e., the centre lies on the bisector of the angle between the two tangents. Let us take some examples. Example 1 : Prove that in two concentric circles, the chord of the larger circle, which touches the smaller circle, is bisected at the point of contact. Solution : We are given two concentric circles C, and C, with centre O and a chord AB of the larger circle C, which touches the smaller circle C, at the point P (see Fig. 10.8). We need to prove that AP = BP. Let us join OP. Then, AB is a tangent to C, at P and OP is its radius. Therefore, by Theorem 10.1, OP L AB Reprint 2025-26 Fig. 10.8 150 MATHEMATICS Now AB 1s a chord of the circle C, and OP | AB. Therefore, OP is the bisector of the chord AB, as the perpendicular from the centre bisects the chord, L.e., AP = BP Example 2 : Two tangents TP and TQ are drawn to a circle with centre O from an external point T. P Prove that Z PTQ =2 Z OPQ. Solution : We are given a circle with centre O, . T an external point T and two tangents TP and TQ S to the circle, where P, Q are the points of contact (see Fig. 10.9). We need to prove that O Z PTQ= 2 Z OPQ Fig. 10.9 Let ZPTQ=0 Now, by Theorem 10.2, TP = TQ. So, TPQ is an isosceles triangle. 1 1 Therefore, Z TPQ = Z TQP = J (180 8) = 90 3 Also, by Theorem 10.1, Z OPT = 90 So, Z OPQ = Z OPT Z TPQ = 90 [0 ; 0| 1 1 = 0= /PT 2 2 Q This gives ZPTQ=2 Z OPQ Example 3 : PQ is a chord of length 8 cm of a circle of radius 5 cm. The tangents at P and Q intersect at a
