is an isosceles triangle. 1 1 Therefore, Z TPQ = Z TQP = J (180 8) = 90 3 Also, by Theorem 10.1, Z OPT = 90 So, Z OPQ = Z OPT Z TPQ = 90 [0 ; 0| 1 1 = 0= /PT 2 2 Q This gives ZPTQ=2 Z OPQ Example 3 : PQ is a chord of length 8 cm of a circle of radius 5 cm. The tangents at P and Q intersect at a point T (see Fig. 10.10). Find the length TP. Solution : Join OT. Let it intersect PQ at the point R. Then A TPQ is isosceles and TO is the angle bisector of Z PTQ. So, OT L PQ and therefore, OT bisects PQ which gives PR=RQ=4 cm. Fig. 10.10 Also, OR= OP? PR*? = Js? ~4 cm =3cm.

This gives TP = RP , 1e., TP = 4 or TP = 20 cm. PO RO 5 3 3 Note : TP can also be found by using the Pythagoras Theorem, as follows: Let TP =x and TR=y. Then Vr=yt+16 (Taking right A PRT) (1) P+ 5 = (yt 3y (Taking right A OPT) (2) Subtracting (1) from (2), we get 32 16 25= 6y-7 or y= 6 3 Therefore, = (4) +16= 6 +9)= 6 5 [From (1)] _ @ or * "3 EXERCISE 10.2 In Q.1 to 3, choose the correct option and give justification. 1.
