perpendicular at the point of contact to the tangent to a circle passes through the centre. . The length of a tangent from a point A at distance 5 cm from the centre of the circle is 4 cm. Find the radius of the circle. . Two concentric circles are of radii 5 cm and 3 cm. Find the length of the chord of the larger circle which touches the smaller circle. . Aquadrilateral ABCD is drawn to circumscribe a circle (see Fig. 10.12). Prove that AB+CD=AD+BC Fig. 10.12 Fig. 10.13 . In Fig. 10.13, XY and X Y are two parallel tangents to a circle with centre O and another tangent AB with point of contact C intersecting XY at A and X Y at B. Prove that Z AOB = 90 . Prove that the angle between the two tangents drawn from an external point to a circle is supplementary to the angle subtended by the line-segment joining the points of contact at the centre. Prove that the parallelogram circumscribing a A circle is a rhombus. A triangle ABC is drawn to circumscribe a circle of radius 4 cm such that the segments BD and DC into which BC is divided by the point of contact D are of lengths 8 cm and 6 cm respectively (see Fig. 10.14). Find the sides AB and AC. Prove that opposite sides of a quadrilateral B . a: . < 6 cm >D< 8 cm > circumscribing a circle subtend supplementary angles at the centre of the circle.
