the building AB, we will first consider the right A PAB. We have tan 30 = AP 1 10 1. ., VB = AP P A Therefore, AP = 10V3 Fig. 9.7 i.e., the distance of the building from P is 10/3 m= 17.32 m. Next, let us suppose DB = x m. Then AD = (10 + x) m. atioh 5 AD _10+x Now, in right A PAD, tan 45 = AP 103 Theref \- 10+ x erefore, ~ 03 ice, x= 10 (v3-1) =7.32 So, the length of the flagstaff is 7.32 m. A Example 5: The shadow of a tower standing ona level ground is found to be 40 m longer when the Sun s altitude is 30 than when it is 60 . Find the height of the tower. Solution : In Fig. 9.8, AB is the tower and BC is the length of the shadow when the p \ /\ Sun s altitude is 60 , i.e., the angle of | < ~40m +>C B elevation of the top of the tower from the tip Fig. 9.8 of the shadow is 60 and DB is the length of the shadow, when the angle of elevation is 30 . Now, let AB be A m and BC be x m. According to the question, DB is 40 m longer than BC.

In AABC tan 60 = AS n ; an = Be h or, 3 = x (1) In A ABD tan 30 = AB n ; an = BD ; 1 A 5 rE V3 -x+ 40 0) From (1), we have h= x3 Putting this value in (2), we get (xV3)v3 =x+40,ie., 3x =x +40 1. ., x = 20 So, h= 20V3 [From (1)] Therefore, the height of the tower is 20./3 m. Example 6: The angles of depression of the top and the bottom of an 8 m tall building from the top of a multi-storeyed building are 30 and 45 , respectively. Find the height of the multistoreyed building and the distance between the two buildings. Solution : In Fig. 9.9, PC denotes the multistoryed building and AB denotes the 8 m tall building. We are interested to determine the height of the multi-storeyed building, i.e., PC and the distance between the two buildings, i.e., AC. Look at the figure carefully. Observe that PB is a transversal to the parallel lines PQ and BD. Therefore, ZQPB and ZPBD are alternate angles, and Ye) are equal. Fig. 9.9 So Z PBD = 30 . Similarly, Z PAC = 45 . In right A PBD, we have Reprint 2025-26 140 MATHEMATICS PD = tan 30 = iL or BD = PD 3 BD iB In right A PAC, we have PC AC = tan 45 = 1.e., PC = AC Also, PC = PD + DC, therefore, PD + DC = AC. Since,
