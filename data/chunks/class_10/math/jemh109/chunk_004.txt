PQ and BD. Therefore, ZQPB and ZPBD are alternate angles, and Ye) are equal. Fig. 9.9 So Z PBD = 30 . Similarly, Z PAC = 45 . In right A PBD, we have Reprint 2025-26 140 MATHEMATICS PD = tan 30 = iL or BD = PD 3 BD iB In right A PAC, we have PC AC = tan 45 = 1.e., PC = AC Also, PC = PD + DC, therefore, PD + DC = AC. Since, AC = BD and DC = AB = 8 m, we get PD + 8 = BD = PDVJ3 (Why?) 8 _ 8(/3+ 1) V3-1 (V3 +1)(V3 -1) So, the height of the multi-storeyed building is {4(v3 + 1) + skim = 4(3 + V3)m This gives PD = = 4( 3 +1)m. and the distance between the two buildings is also 4(3 + V3) m. Example 7 : From a point on a bridge across a river, the angles of depression of the banks on opposite sides of the river are 30 and 45 , respectively. If the bridge is at a height of 3 m from the banks, find the width of the river. Solution : In Fig 9.10, A and B represent points on the bank on opposite sides of the river, so that AB is the width of the river. Pisa point on the bridge at a height of 3 m, i.e., DP = 3 m. We are interested to determine the width of the river, which is the length of the side AB of the D APB. Now, AB = AD + DB In right AAPD, Z A= 30 . N) tan 30 = PD 0, an AD Reprint 2025-26 SOME APPLICATIONS OF TRIGONOMETRY 141 1.e., Also, Now, 3 a> Ap of AD = 3y3 m in right A PBD, 7 B = 45 . So, BD = PD =3 m. AB = BD+ AD =3 + 3V3 =3(1 + V3) m. Therefore, the width of the river is 3 (3 + 1)m . EXERCISE 9.1 . Acircus artist is climbing a 20 m long rope, which is A tightly stretched and tied from the top of a vertical pole to the ground. Find the height of the pole, if the angle made by the rope with the ground level is 30 (see Fig. 9.11). . A tree breaks due to storm and the broken part po (~ bends so that the top of the tree touches the ground making an angle 30 with it. The distance between Fig. 9.11 the foot of the tree to the point where the top touches the ground is 8 m. Find the height of the tree. . Acontractor plans to install two slides for the children to play in a park. For the children below the age of 5 years, she prefers to havea slide whose top is at a height of 1.5 m, and is inclined at an angle of 30 to the ground, whereas for elder
