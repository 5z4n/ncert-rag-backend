the pole should she place the foot of the ladder? (You may take 3 = 1.73) Solution : In Fig. 9.5, the electrician is required to reach the point B on the pole AD. So, BD = AD - AB = (5 - 1.3)m = 3.7 m. Fig..9.5 Here, BC represents the ladder. We need to find its length, 1.e., the hypotenuse of the right triangle BDC. Now, can you think which trigonometic ratio should we consider? It should be sin 60 . 3.7. B So, Bc) sn 60 or BC. i.e., the length of the ladder should be 4.28 m. Now, BD cot 60 = B Le., DC = B = 2.14 m (approx.) Therefore, she should place the foot of the ladder at a distance of 2.14 m from the pole.

What is the height of the chimney? Solution : Here, AB is the chimney, CD the observer and Z ADE the angle of elevation (see Fig. 9.6). In this case, ADE is a triangle, right-angled at E and we are required to find the height of the chimney. We have AB = AE+ BE=AE+1.5 and DE= CB=28.5 m To determine AE, we choose a trigonometric ratio, which involves both AE and DE. Let us choose the tangent of the angle of elevation. N tan 45 = AE ow, an DE ,_ AE Le., 285 Therefore, AE = 28.5 So the height of the chimney (AB) = (28.5 + 1.5) m= 30 m. Example 4 : From a point P on the ground the angle of elevation of the top of a 10 m tall building is 30 . A flag is hoisted at the top of the building and the angle of elevation of the top of the flagstaff from P is 45 . Find the length of the flagstaff and the distance of the building from the point P. (You may take ./3 = 1.732) Solution : In Fig. 9.7, AB denotes the height of the building, BD the flagstaff and P the given point. Note that there are two right triangles PAB and PAD. We are required to find the length of the flagstaff, i.e., DB and the distance of the building from the point P, 1.e., PA. Reprint 2025-26 138 MATHEMATICS Since, we know the height of the building AB, we will first consider the right A PAB. We have tan 30 = AP 1 10 1. ., VB = AP P A Therefore, AP = 10V3 Fig. 9.7 i.e., the distance of the building from P is 10/3 m= 17.32 m. Next, let us suppose DB = x m. Then AD = (10 + x) m. atioh 5 AD _10+x Now, in right A PAD, tan 45 = AP 103 Theref \- 10+ x erefore, ~
