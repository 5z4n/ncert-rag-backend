S,= a or S = ae So, the sum of first 1 positive integers is given by n(n + 1) nn Example 15 : Find the sum of first 24 terms of the list of numbers whose nth term is given by a,=3+2n Solution : As a,= 3+ 2n, so, a,=3+2=5 a,=3+2x2=7 a,=3+2x3=9 w List of numbers becomes 5, 7,9, 11,... Here, 7-5=9- 7=11- 9=2 and so on. So, it forms an AP with common difference d= 2. To find S,,, we haven=24, a=5, d=2. 24? Therefore, S.4= cy 2X5 + 24-D xd] = 12[10+ 46] =672 So, sum of first 24 terms of the list of numbers is 672. Example 16 : A manufacturer of TV sets produced 600 sets in the third year and 700 sets in the seventh year. Assuming that the production increases uniformly by a fixed number every year, find : (i) the production in the Ist year (ii) the production in the 10th year (iti) the total production in first 7 years Solution : (1) Since the production increases uniformly by a fixed number every year, the number of TV sets manufactured in Ist, 2nd, 3rd, .. ., years will form an AP. Let us denote the number of TV sets manufactured in the nth year by a. Then, a, = 600 and a,= 700 Reprint 2025-26 Or, a+ 2d= 600 and a+ 6d = 700 Solving these equations, we get d=25 and a=550. Therefore, production of TV sets in the first year is 550. (ii) Now a, = 4+ 9d=550 +9 x 25 = 775 So, production of TV sets in the 10th year is 775. (iii) Also, S.= 5 [2x 550+ (7 1) x25] = = [1100+ 150] = 4375 Thus, the total production of TV sets in first 7 years is 4375. EXERCISE 5.3 1.
