fourthterm a, = a,+d=(a+2d)+d=a+3d=a+(4-l)d 4 3 Looking at the pattern, we can say that the nth term a, =a+(n 1)d. So, the nth term a, of the AP with first term a and common difference d is given bya, =at+(n -1)d. Reprint 2025-26 58 MATHEMATICS a_ is also called the general term of the AP. If there are m terms in the AP, then a,, represents the last term which is sometimes also denoted by /. Let us consider some examples. Example 3 : Find the 10th term of the AP: 2,7, 12,... Solution : Here,a=2, d=7-2=5 and n= 10. We have a,=at+(n l)d So, a, =2+ (10-1) x5=2+45=47 Therefore, the 10th term of the given AP is 47. Example 4: Which term of the AP: 21, 18, 15,...is 81? Also, is any term 0? Give reason for your answer. Solution : Here, a = 21, d= 18 21= 3 and a,=~ 81, and we have to find n. As a,=a+(n-l1)d, we have 81=21+(n 1)(-3) 81= 24-3n 105= -3n So, n = 35 Therefore, the 35th term of the given AP is 81. Next, we want to know if there is any n for which a = 0. If such an n is there, then 21+ (n - 1)(-3)= 9, i.e., 3(n 1) = 21 Le., n= 8 So, the eighth term is 0. Example 5 : Determine the AP whose 3rd term is 5 and the 7th term is 9. Solution : We have a,=at+(3- 1)d=at2d=5 (1) and a,=at+(7 1)d=a+6d=9 (2) Solving the pair of linear equations (1) and (2), we get a= 3, d=1 Hence, the required AP is 3, 4,5, 6, 7,... Reprint 2025-26 ARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS 59 Example 6 : Check whether 301 is a term of the list of numbers 5, 11, 17, 23,... Solution : We have : a, a,=11-5=6, a,-a,=17-11=6, a, a,=23-17=6 As a,,, 4, is the same for k = 1, 2, 3, etc., the given list of numbers is an AP. Now, a=5 and d=6. Let 301 be a term, say, the nth term of this AP. We know that 3 4 3 a,=at(n l)d So, 301=5+(n-1) x 6 Le., 301= 6n -1 5 _ 302 _151 O, n= 6 3 But 7 should be a positive integer (Why?). So, 301 is not a term of the given list of numbers. Example 7 : How many two-digit numbers are divisible by 3? Solution : The list of two-digit numbers divisible by 3 is : 12, 15, 18,..., 99 Is this an AP? Yes it is. Here, a= 12, d=3, a,=99. As a,=at+(n -1)d, we have 99 = 12+ (n -1) x3 i.e., 87= (n 1) x3 i.e. n -1= eh <9 L.e., n= 29+1=30 So, there are 30 two-digit numbers divisible by 3. Example 8 : Find the 11th term from the last term (towards the first term) of the AP: 10,7, 4,..., 62. Solution: Here, a=10, d=7-10= 3, /= 62, where l= at+(n-l1)d Reprint 2025-26 60 MATHEMATICS To find the 11th
