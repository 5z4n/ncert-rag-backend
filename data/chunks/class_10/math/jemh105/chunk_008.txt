30 years, we shall find a,,. Now, a,, = a+ (30-1) d= 80 + 29 x 80 = 2400 So, the interest at the end of 30 years will be = 2400. Example 10 : In a flower bed, there are 23 rose plants in the first row, 21 in the second, 19 in the third, and so on. There are 5 rose plants in the last row. How many rows are there in the flower bed? Solution : The number of rose plants in the Ist, 2nd, 3rd, . . ., rows are : 23,21, 19,...,5 It forms an AP (Why?). Let the number of rows in the flower bed be n. Then a=23, d=21 -23= -2, a, =5 As, a,=at(n l)jd We have, 5= 23 +(n-1)(-2) Le., 18= (n - 1)- 2) 1. ., n= 10 So, there are 10 rows in the flower bed.
