) after paying 5 % of the total loan of = 1000 every month is 950, 900, 850, 800, .. ., 50. (d) The cash prizes ( in = ) given by a school to the toppers of Classes I to XII are, respectively, 200, 250, 300, 350, ..., 750. (e) The total savings (in %) after every month for 10 months when % 50 are saved each month are 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500. It is left as an exercise for you to explain why each of the lists above is an AP. You can see that a,a+d,at2d,a+3d,... represents an arithmetic progression where a is the first term and d the common difference. This is called the general form of an AP. Note that in examples (a) to (e) above, there are only a finite number of terms. Such an AP is called a finite AP. Also note that each of these Arithmetic Progressions (APs) has a last term. The APs in examples (1) to (v) in this section, are not finite APs and so they are called infinite Arithmetic Progressions. Such APs do not have a last term. Now, to know about an AP, what is the minimum information that you need? Is it enough to know the first term? Or, is it enough to know only the common difference? You will find that you will need to know both the first term a and the common difference d. For instance if the first term a is 6 and the common difference d is 3, then the AP is 6, 9,12, 15,... and if a is 6 and d is 3, then the AP is 6, 3,0,-3,... Reprint 2025-26 ARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS 53 Similarly, when a= -7, d=-2, theAPis 7, 9,-11,-13,... a= 1.0, d=0.1, the APis 1.0, 1.1, 1.2,1.3,... 1 1 a= 0, d=1 the AP is 0, 15,3,45,6.-. N| a=2, d=0, the APis 2,2,2,2,... So, if you know what a and d are, you can list the AP. What about the other way round? That is, if you are given a list of numbers can you say that it is an AP and then find a and d? Since ais the first term, it can easily be written. We know that in an AP, every succeeding term is obtained by adding d to the preceding term. So, d found by subtracting any term from its succeeding term, i.e., the term which immediately follows it should be same for an AP. For example, for the list of numbers : 6,9, 12, 15,..., We have a, a,=9 6=3, a, a,= 12-9 =3, a, a,=15-12=3 Here the difference of any two consecutive terms in each case is 3. So, the given list is an AP whose first term a is 6 and common difference d is 3. For the list of numbers : 6, 3, 0, 3,..., a, a,=3- 6= 3 a, a,=0- 3= 3 a, a,=-3- 0 =-3 Similarly this is also an AP whose
