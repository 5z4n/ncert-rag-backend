let us first see what her monthly salary for the second year would be. It would be = (8000 + 500) = = 8500. In the same way, we can find the monthly salary for the 3rd, 4th and 5th year by adding = 500 to the salary of the previous year. So, the salary for the 3rd year = (8500 + 500) = = (8000 + 500 + 500) = = (8000 + 2 x 500) = = [8000 + (3 - 1) x 500] (for the 3rd year) = = 9000 Salary for the 4th year = (9000 + 500) = = (8000 + 500 + 500 + 500) = = (8000 + 3 x 500) = = [8000 + (4- 1) x 500] (for the 4th year) = =9500 Salary for the 5th year =% (9500 + 500) = %(8000+500+500+500 + 500) = = (8000 + 4 x 500) = [8000 + (5-1) x 500] (for the 5th year) = 10000 Observe that we are getting a list of numbers 8000, 8500, 9000, 9500, 10000, .. . These numbers are in AP. (Why?) Reprint 2025-26 ARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS 57 Now, looking at the pattern formed above, can you find her monthly salary for the 6th year? The 15th year? And, assuming that she will still be working in the job, what about the monthly salary for the 25th year? You would calculate this by adding = 500 each time to the salary of the previous year to give the answer. Can we make this process shorter? Let us see. You may have already got some idea from the way we have obtained the salaries above. Salary for the 15th year = Salary for the 14th year + = 500 500 + 500 +500 + ...+500 13 times =z S000 + |: = 500 = [8000 + 14 x 500] = [8000 + (15 1) x 500] = = 15000 L.e., First salary + (15 1) x Annual increment. In the same way, her monthly salary for the 25th year would be = [8000 + (25 1) x 500] = = 20000 = First salary + (25 1) x Annual increment This example would have given you some idea about how to write the 15th term, or the 25th term, and more generally, the nth term of the AP. Let a,, a,, a,,... be an AP whose first term a, is a and the common difference is d. Then, the second term a,= a+d=at(2-1)d the thirdterm a,= a,+d=(atd)+d=at2d=a+t(3-1)d the fourthterm a, = a,+d=(a+2d)+d=a+3d=a+(4-l)d 4 3 Looking at the pattern, we can say that the nth term a, =a+(n 1)d. So, the nth term a, of the AP with first term a and common difference d is given bya, =at+(n -1)d. Reprint 2025-26 58 MATHEMATICS a_ is also called the general term of the AP. If there are m terms in the AP, then a,, represents the last term which is sometimes also denoted by /. Let us consider some
