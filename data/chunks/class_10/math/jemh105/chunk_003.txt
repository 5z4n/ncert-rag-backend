the list of numbers : 6,9, 12, 15,..., We have a, a,=9 6=3, a, a,= 12-9 =3, a, a,=15-12=3 Here the difference of any two consecutive terms in each case is 3. So, the given list is an AP whose first term a is 6 and common difference d is 3. For the list of numbers : 6, 3, 0, 3,..., a, a,=3- 6= 3 a, a,=0- 3= 3 a, a,=-3- 0 =-3 Similarly this is also an AP whose first term is 6 and the common difference is 3. In general, for an AP a,, a,,..., a,, we have d= Ae 7 where a,,, and a, are the (k + 1)th and the kth terms respectively. To obtain d in a given AP, we need not find all of a, a It is enough to find only one of them. 74, 4,,4,-ay,.... Consider the list ofnumbers 1, 1, 2,3, 5,.... By looking at it, you can tell that the difference between any two consecutive terms is not the same. So, this is not an AP. Reprint 2025-26 54 MATHEMATICS Note that to find d in the AP: 6, 3, 0, 3,..., we have subtracted 6 from 3 and not 3 from 6, i.e., we should subtract the Ath term from the (A + 1) th term even if the (k + 1) th term is smaller. Let us make the concept more clear through some examples. Example 1 : For the AP: 7 | 7 : ,..., write the first term a and the common difference d. Soluti H ; ; olution : Here, a 7 a) Remember that we can find d using any two consecutive terms, once we know that the numbers are in AP. Example 2 : Which of the following list of numbers form an AP? If they form an AP, write the next two terms : (i) 4, 10, 16, 22,... (ii) 1,- 1,-3,-5,... (iil) 2,2,- 2,2,-2,... (iv) 1,1, 1,2, 2,2,3,3,3,... Solution: (i) We have a, a, =10-4= 6 a a, =16-10= 6 3 2 a a, =22- 16 =6 4 3 a, 1s the same every time. Le, a,,, So, the given list of numbers forms an AP with the common difference d= 6. The next two terms are: 22 + 6 = 28 and 28 + 6 = 34. (it) a, a, = - 1-1=-2 a, a,= 3-(-1)=-3+1=-2 a, a,= ~5 (-3)=-5+3=-2 i. ., d,,, a, iS the same every time. k+1 So, the given list of numbers forms an AP with the common difference d = 2. The next two terms are: ~5+(-2)=-7 and ~7+(-2)=-9 (ili) a,-a,=2- (-2)=2+2=4 ad, a,= -2- 2= 4 Asa, a, # a,~ a,, the given list of numbers does not form an AP. Reprint 2025-26 ARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS 55 (iv) a, a,=1-1=0 a, a,=1- 1=0 a, -a,=2-1=1 Here, a, a =d, -da,#a, a 1 3 So, the given list of numbers does not form an AP. EXERCISE 5.1 1.
