She has been offered the job with a starting monthly salary of = 8000, with an annual increment of = 500. What would be her monthly salary for the fifth year? To answer this, let us first see what her monthly salary for the second year would be. It would be = (8000 + 500) = = 8500. In the same way, we can find the monthly salary for the 3rd, 4th and 5th year by adding = 500 to the salary of the previous year. So, the salary for the 3rd year = (8500 + 500) = = (8000 + 500 + 500) = = (8000 + 2 x 500) = = [8000
