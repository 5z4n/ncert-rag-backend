can find the fourth. Remark : The nth term of an AP is the difference of the sum to first m terms and the sum to first (7 1) terms of it,i.e.,a =S S _.. Let us consider some examples. Example 11 : Find the sum of the first 22 terms of the AP: 8, 3, 2,... Solution : Here, a= 8, d=3- 8 5, n=22. We know that S = 5 atin Na] Therefore, S= 5 [6 + 21(-5)] = 11(16 105) = 11(-89) = 979 So, the sum of the first 22 terms of the AP is 979. Example 12 : If the sum of the first 14 terms of an AP is 1050 and its first term is 10, find the 20th term. Solution : Here, S,,= 1050, n= 14, a= 10. As S = 52a (nd), so, 1050= 5 [204134] = 140 + 91d Reprint 2025-26 66 MATHEMATICS Le., 910= 91d Or, d= 10 Therefore, a 10 + (20 1) x 10 = 200, i.e. 20th term is 200. Example 13 : How many terms of the AP: 24, 21, 18, .. . must be taken so that their sum is 78? Solution : Here, a = 24, d=21 24= 3, S = 78. We need to find n. n We know that S = 3 [2a+(n -Dd] n n So, 78 = L484 1\(-3)] = 5L51 3n] or 3n? 51n+ 156= 0 or w 17n+52=0 or (n 4)(n 13) = 0 or n=4 or 13 Both values of 7 are admissible. So, the number of terms is either 4 or 13. Remarks: 1. In this case, the sum of the first 4 terms = the sum of the first 13 terms = 78. 2. Two answers are possible because the sum of the terms from Sth to 13th will be zero. This is because a is positive and d is negative, so that some terms will be positive and some others negative, and will cancel out each other. Example 14 : Find the sum of : (i) the first 1000 positive integers (ii) the first 7 positive integers Solution : (i) LetS=1+2+3+...+1000 n Using the formula S| = 5 +1) for the sum of the first n terms of an AP, we have we (1+ 1000) = 500 x 1001 = 500500 So, the sum of the first 1000 positive integers is 500500. (ii) LetS =1+2+3+...+n Here a = | and the last term / is n. Reprint 2025-26 ARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS 67 n(l+n) n(n+l) Therefore, S,= a or S = ae So, the sum of first 1 positive integers is given by n(n + 1) nn Example 15 : Find the sum of first 24 terms of the list of numbers whose nth term is given by a,=3+2n Solution : As a,= 3+ 2n, so, a,=3+2=5 a,=3+2x2=7 a,=3+2x3=9 w List of numbers becomes 5, 7,9, 11,... Here, 7-5=9- 7=11- 9=2 and so on. So, it forms an AP with common difference d= 2. To find
