100+99+...+34+2+1 Adding these two, he got 28 = (100 + 1)+(99 +2) +...+(3 + 98) +(2 + 99) + (1 + 100) = 101+101+...+101+101 (100 times) So, S= RAAT = 5050 i.e. the sum = 5050. Reprint 2025-26 64 MATHEMATICS We will now use the same technique to find the sum of the first n terms of an AP: a,at+d,a+2d,... The nth term of this AP is a + (n 1) d. Let S denote the sum of the first 7 terms of the AP. We have S=at+(a+d)+(at+2d)+...+[a+(n-1)d] (1) Rewriting the terms in reverse order, we have S=[a+(n -1)d]+[a+(n-2)d]+...+(at+d)+a (2) On adding (1) and (2), term-wise. we get [2a+ (n ld] +[2a+ (n-1)d]+...+[2a+ (n 1)d] +[2a+ (n -1)d] 25= n times o, 2S=n[2a+(n-1)d] (Since, there are n terms) o, S= 5 [2a +(n 1) d] So, the sum of the first n terms of an AP is given by n S= 2 [2a + (n 1) d] n We can also write this as S= 5 lata+(n-1)d| n Le., S=5 @ta,) (3) Now, if there are only n terms in an AP, then a, = /, the last term. From (3), we see that s=" (+l 4 =F ath (4) This form of the result is useful when the first and the last terms of an AP are given and the common difference is not given. Now we return to the question that was posed to us in the beginning. The amount of money (in Rs) in the money box of Shakila s daughter on Ist, 2nd, 3rd, 4th birthday, ..., were 100, 150, 200, 250, .. ., respectively. This is an AP. We have to find the total money collected on her 21st birthday, i.e., the sum of the first 21 terms of this AP. Reprint 2025-26 ARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS 65 Here, a= 100, d=50 and n=21. Using the formula : S= 5 [atin], 21 21 we have S= [2100 + 21-1) x50] = [200 + 1000] = = 1200 = 12600 So, the amount of money collected on her 21st birthday is = 12600. Hasn t the use of the formula made it much easier to solve the problem? We also use S in place of S to denote the sum of first n terms of the AP. We write S,, to denote the sum of the first 20 terms of an AP. The formula for the sum of the first m terms involves four quantities S, a, d and n. If we know any three of them, we can find the fourth. Remark : The nth term of an AP is the difference of the sum to first m terms and the sum to first (7 1) terms of it,i.e.,a =S S _.. Let us consider some examples. Example 11 : Find the sum of the first 22 terms of the AP: 8, 3, 2,... Solution : Here, a= 8, d=3- 8 5, n=22. We know that S = 5 atin Na] Therefore, S= 5 [6 + 21(-5)]
