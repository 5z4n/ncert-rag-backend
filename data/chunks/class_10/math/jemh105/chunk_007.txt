Yes it is. Here, a= 12, d=3, a,=99. As a,=at+(n -1)d, we have 99 = 12+ (n -1) x3 i.e., 87= (n 1) x3 i.e. n -1= eh <9 L.e., n= 29+1=30 So, there are 30 two-digit numbers divisible by 3. Example 8 : Find the 11th term from the last term (towards the first term) of the AP: 10,7, 4,..., 62. Solution: Here, a=10, d=7-10= 3, /= 62, where l= at+(n-l1)d Reprint 2025-26 60 MATHEMATICS To find the 11th term from the last term, we will find the total number of terms in the AP. So, 62 = 10+ (n 1)(-3) L.e., 72 = (n 1)(-3) L.e., n -1=24 or n= 25 So, there are 25 terms in the given AP. The 11th term from the last term will be the 15th term. (Note that it will not be the 14th term. Why?) So, a,, = 10+ (15 1)(-3) = 10-42 =- 32 i.e., the 11th term from the last term is 32. Alternative Solution : If we write the given AP in the reverse order, then a = 62 and d = 3 (Why?) So, the question now becomes finding the 11th term with these a and d. So, a,, = 62+ (11-1) 3= 62+ 30= 32 So, the 11th term, which is now the required term, is 32. Example 9: Asum of? 1000 is invested at 8% simple interest per year. Calculate the interest at the end of each year. Do these interests form an AP? If so, find the interest at the end of 30 years making use of this fact. Solution : We know that the formula to calculate simple interest is given by Simple Interest = PxRxt imple Interest = ~~, . 1000 x 8 x1 So, the interest at the end of the Ist year = * 100 = = 80 . 1000 x 8x2 The interest at the end of the 2nd year= * 100 =% 160 ; 1000 x 8x3 The interest at the end of the 3rd year = * 100 = % 240 Similarly, we can obtain the interest at the end of the 4th year, 5th year, and so on. So, the interest (in %) at the end of the Ist, 2nd, 3rd, . . . years, respectively are 80, 160, 240,... Reprint 2025-26 ARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS 61 It is an AP as the difference between the consecutive terms in the list is 80, 1.e., d= 80. Also, a= 80. So, to find the interest at the end of 30 years, we shall find a,,. Now, a,, = a+ (30-1) d= 80 + 29 x 80 = 2400 So, the interest at the end of 30 years will be = 2400. Example 10 : In a flower bed, there are 23 rose plants in the first row, 21 in the second, 19 in the third, and so on. There are 5 rose plants in the last row. How many rows are there in the flower bed? Solution : The
