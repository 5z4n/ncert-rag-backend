numbers, and so on. In this chapter, we shall discuss one of these patterns in which succeeding terms are obtained by adding a fixed number to the preceding terms. We shall also see how to find their nth terms and the sum of 1 consecutive terms, and use this knowledge in solving some daily life problems. 5.2 Arithmetic Progressions Consider the following lists of numbers : (i) 1, 2, 3, 4,... (ii) 100, 70, 40, 10,... (iil) 3, 2, -1, 0,... (iv) 3, 3, 3, 3,... (v) 1.0, -1.5, 2.0, -2.5,... Each of the numbers in the list is called a term. Given a term, can you write the next term in each of the lists above? If so, how will you write it? Perhaps by following a pattern or rule. Let us observe and write the tule. In (a), each term is 1 more than the term preceding it. In (ii), each term is 30 less than the term preceding it. In (iii), each term is obtained by adding | to the term preceding it. In (iv), all the terms in the list are 3 , i.e., each term is obtained by adding (or subtracting) 0 to the term preceding it. In (v), each term is obtained by adding 0.5 to (i.e., subtracting 0.5 from) the term preceding it. In all the lists above, we see that successive terms are obtained by adding a fixed number to the preceding terms. Such list of numbers is said to form an Arithmetic Progression ( AP ). So, an arithmetic progression is a list of numbers in which each term is obtained by adding a fixed number to the preceding term except the first term. This fixed number is called the common difference of the AP. Remember that it can be positive, negative or zero. Reprint 2025-26 52 MATHEMATICS Let us denote the first term of an AP by a,, second term by a,,. . ., nth term by a, and the common difference by d. Then the AP becomes d,, d,, a,,.. ., d,. n So, a,-a,=a,-a,=...=a-a,,=d. Some more examples of AP are: (a) The heights ( in cm ) of some students of a school standing in a queue in the morning assembly are 147 , 148, 149, ..., 157. (b) The minimum temperatures ( in degree celsius ) recorded for a week in the month of January in a city, arranged in ascending order are 3.1, 3.0, 2.9, 2.8, 2.7, 2.6, 2.5 (c) The balance money ( in @ ) after paying 5 % of the total loan of = 1000 every month is 950, 900, 850, 800, .. ., 50. (d) The cash prizes ( in = ) given by a school to the toppers of Classes I to XII are, respectively, 200, 250, 300, 350, ..., 750. (e) The total savings (in %) after every month for 10 months when % 50 are saved each month are 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500.
