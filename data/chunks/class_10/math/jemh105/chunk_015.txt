required for the rungs? [Hint : Number of rungs = ~ +1] 4. The houses ofa row are numbered consecutively from | to 49. Show that there is a value of x such that the sum of the numbers of the houses preceding the house numbered x is equal to the sum of the numbers of the houses following it. Find this value of x. [Hint:S |, =S,,-S] 5. A small terrace at a football ground comprises of 15 steps each of which is 50 m long and built of solid concrete. 1 1 Each step has arise of qm and a tread of 5m. (see Fig. 5.8). Calculate the total volume of concrete required to build the terrace. 1 1 [Hint : Volume of concrete required to build the first step = ri x 5 x 50 m ] Fig. 5.8 * These exercises are not from the examination point of view.

An arithmetic progression (AP) is a list of numbers in which each term is obtained by adding a fixed number d to the preceding term, except the first term. The fixed number d is called the common difference. The general form ofan AP isa, at+d, a+2d, at+3d,... . A given list of numbers a,, a,, a,,... is an AP, if the differences a, a,, a, a,, a, 4,,..., give the same value, 1.e., ifa,, , a, 1s the same for different values of k. . Inan AP with first term a and common difference d, the nth term (or the general term) is givenby a,=at(n l)d. . The sum of the first 7 terms of an AP is given by : S= 5 (2a + (n-1)d] . If /is the last term of the finite AP, say the nth term, then the sum of all terms of the AP is given by: nN = (a+tl S 5 (4 ) A NOTE TO THE READER at+c If a, b, c are in AP, then b = 5 and b is called the arithmetic mean of a and c.
