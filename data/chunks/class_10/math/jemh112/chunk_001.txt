Total Surface Area and Curved Surface Area respectively. Let us now consider another situation. Suppose we are making a toy by putting together a hemisphere and a cone. Let us see the steps that we would be going through. Reprint 2025-26 SURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES 163 First, we would take a cone and a hemisphere and bring their flat faces together. Here, of course, we would take the base radius of the cone equal to the radius of the hemisphere, for the toy is to have a smooth surface. So, the steps would be as shown in Fig. 12.5. = fF = Fig. 12.5 At the end of our trial, we have got ourselves a nice round-bottomed toy. Now if we want to find how much paint we would require to colour the surface of this toy, what would we need to know? We would need to know the surface area of the toy, which consists of the CSA of the hemisphere and the CSA of the cone. So, we can say: Total surface area of the toy = CSA of hemisphere + CSA of cone Now, let us consider some examples. Example 1 : Rasheed gota playing top (/attu) as his birthday present, which surprisingly had no colour on it. He wanted to colour it with his crayons. The top is shaped like a cone surmounted by a hemisphere (see Fig 12.6). The entire top is 5 cm in height and the diameter of the top is 3.5 cm. Find the area he Fig. 12.6 has to colour. (Take m = >) Solution : This top is exactly like the object we have discussed in Fig. 12.5. So, we can conveniently use the result we have arrived at there. That is : TSA of the toy = CSA of hemisphere + CSA of cone : 1 2 2 Now, the curved surface area of the hemisphere = 5 (ane ) = 2mr 22 3.5 3.5 2 =|2x x x cm 7 2 2 Reprint 2025-26 164 MATHEMATICS Also, the height of the cone = height of the top height (radius) of the hemispherical part 3.5 =|5 3 cm = 3,25cm / 3.5 So, the slant height of the cone (/ )= rth = 3) + (3.25)? cm =3.7 cm (approx.) 22 3.5 Therefore, CSA of cone = mr/ = 7% 5 x 3.7 This gives the surface area of the top as = Cera err 7 2 2 22 11 = 7% = (3.5 + 3.7) cm* = 3% (3.5 + 3.7) cm* = 39.6 cm? (approx.) You may note that total surface area of the top is not the sum of the total surface areas of the cone and hemisphere. 4.2. em < Example 2 : The decorative block shown in Fig. 12.7 is made of two solids a cube and a hemisphere. The base of the block is a cube with edge 5 cm, and the hemisphere fixed on the top has a diameter of 4.2 cm.
