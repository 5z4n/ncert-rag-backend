The height of the cylinder is 1.45 m and its radius is 30 cm. Find the total surface area of the bird-bath. (Take 1 -_ s ) Solution : Let h be height of the cylinder, and 7 the common radius of the cylinder and hemisphere. Then, Fig. 12.9 the total surface area of the bird-bath = CSA of cylinder + CSA of hemisphere = 2nrh + 2nr? = 2mr(h+ r) 2x = x 30(145 +30) cm? = 33000 cm? = 3.3 m EXERCISE 12.1 Unless stated otherwise, take 1 = 7 1. 2 cubes each of volume 64 cm? are joined end to end. Find the surface area of the resulting cuboid. 2. A vessel is in the form of a hollow hemisphere mounted by a hollow cylinder. The diameter of the hemisphere is 14 cm and the total height of the vessel is 13 cm. Find the inner surface area of the vessel. 3. A toy is in the form ofa cone of radius 3.5 cm mounted on a hemisphere of same radius. The total height of the toy is 15.5 cm. Find the total surface area of the toy. 4. A cubical block of side 7 cm is surmounted by a hemisphere. What is the greatest diameter the hemisphere can have? Find the surface area of the solid. 5. A hemispherical depression is cut out from one face of a cubical wooden block such that the diameter / of the hemisphere is equal to the edge of the cube. Determine the surface area of the remaining solid. 6. A medicine capsule is in the shape of a cylinder with two hemispheres stuck to each of its ends (see Fig. 12.10). The length of the entire capsule is 14 mm and the diameter 14mm of the capsule is 5 mm. Find its surface area. Fig. 12.10 Reprint 2025-26 SURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES 167 7. A tent is in the shape of a cylinder surmounted by a conical top. If the height and diameter of the cylindrical part are 2.1 m and 4 m respectively, and the slant height of the top is 2.8 m, find the area of the canvas used for making the tent. Also, find the cost of the canvas of the tent at the rate of %500 per m . (Note that the base
