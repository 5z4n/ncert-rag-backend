(3.5 + 3.7) cm* = 39.6 cm? (approx.) You may note that total surface area of the top is not the sum of the total surface areas of the cone and hemisphere. 4.2. em < Example 2 : The decorative block shown in Fig. 12.7 is made of two solids a cube and a hemisphere. The base of the block is a cube with edge 5 cm, and the hemisphere fixed on the top has a diameter of 4.2 cm. Find the total surface area of the block. (Take t = ) 5 cm 7 Fig. 12.7 Solution : The total surface area of the cube = 6 x (edge)? = 6 x 5 x 5 cm = 150 cm . Note that the part of the cube where the hemisphere is attached is not included in the surface area. So, the surface area of the block = TSA of cube base area of hemisphere + CSA of hemisphere 150 mr? + 2 mr? = (150 + mr ) cm? 150 cm? + 22 42 42 cm? 7 2 2 (150 + 13.86) cm? = 163.86 cm? Reprint 2025-26 SURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES 165 Example 3 : A wooden toy rocket is in the shape of a cone mounted on a cylinder, as shown in Fig. 12.8. The height of the entire rocket is 26 cm, while the height of the conical part is 6 cm. The base of the conical portion has a diameter of 5 cm, while the base diameter of the cylindrical portion is 3 cm. If the conical portion is to be painted orange and the cylindrical portion yellow, find the Sem area of the rocket painted with each of these colours. (Take m = 3.14) 26 cm base of cylinder Solution : Denote radius of cone by 7, slant height of cone by /, height of cone by h, radius of cylinder by 7 and height of cylinder by h . Then r = 2.5 cm, h = 6 cm, 7 = 1.5 cm, h = 26 6 = 20 cm and l= Jr +h? = /252 +67 em =6.5em Here, the conical portion has its circular base resting on the base of the cylinder, but the base of the cone is larger than the base of the cylinder. So, a part of the base of the cone (a ring) is to be painted. base of cone Fig. 12.8 So, the area to be painted orange = CSA of the cone + base area of the cone base area of the cylinder = tl + tr nr) = m[(2.5 x 6.5) + (2.5)?

Now, _ the area to be painted yellow = CSA of the cylinder + area of one base of the cylinder = 2nr h + nr ) = tr (2h +7 ) = (3.14 x 1.5) (2 x 20 + 1.5) cm? = 4.71 x 41.5 cm? = 195.465
