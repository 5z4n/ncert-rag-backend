surmounted by another cylinder of height 60 cm and radius 8 cm. Find the mass of the pole, given that 1 cm? of iron has approximately 8g mass. (Use tm = 3.14) . Asolid consisting of a right circular cone of height 120 cm and radius 60 cm standing on a hemisphere of radius 60 cm is placed upright in a right circular cylinder full of water such that it touches the bottom. Find the volume of water left in the cylinder, if the radius of the cylinder is 60 cm and its height is 180 cm. . Aspherical glass vessel has a cylindrical neck 8 cm long, 2 cm in diameter; the diameter of the spherical part is 8.5 cm. By measuring the amount of water it holds, a child finds its volume to be 345 cm*. Check whether she is correct, taking the above as the inside measurements, and m= 3.14. Summary In this chapter, you have studied the following points: 1. To determine the surface area of an object formed by combining any two of the basic solids, namely, cuboid, cone, cylinder, sphere and hemisphere. To find the volume of objects formed by combining any two ofa cuboid, cone, cylinder, sphere and hemisphere. Reprint 2025-26
