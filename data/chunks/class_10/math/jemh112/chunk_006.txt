2) x2] em> = 25.12 cm3 Now, let the right circular cylinder EFGH circumscribe the given solid. The radius of the base of the right circular cylinder = HP = BO = 2 cm, and its height is EH = AO + OP =(2+ 2) cm=4cm So, the volume required = volume of the right circular cylinder volume of the toy = (3.14 x 2? x 4 25.12) cm? = 25.12 cm? Hence, the required difference of the two volumes = 25.12 cm . EXERCISE 12.2 Unless stated otherwise, take m= 7: 1. A solid is in the shape of a cone standing on a hemisphere with both their radii being equal to | cm and the height of the cone is equal to its radius. Find the volume of the solid in terms of 7. 2. Rachel, an engineering student, was asked to make a model shaped like a cylinder with two cones attached at its two ends by using a thin aluminium sheet. The diameter of the model is 3 cm and its length is 12 cm. If each cone has a height of 2 cm, find the volume of air contained in the model that Rachel made. (Assume the outer and inner dimensions of the model to be nearly the same.) Reprint 2025-26 12.4 . A gulab jamun, contains sugar syrup up to about <a MATHEMATICS 30% of its volume. Find approximately how much syrup would be found in 45 gulab jamuns, each shaped like a cylinder with two hemispherical ends with length 5 cm and diameter 2.8 cm (see Fig. 12.15). . A pen stand made of wood is in the shape of a Fig. 12.15 cuboid with four conical depressions to hold pens. The dimensions of the cuboid are 15 cm by 10 cm by 3.5cm. The radius of each of the depressions is 0.5 cm and the depth is 1.4 cm. Find the volume of wood in the entire stand (see Fig. 12.16). . A vessel is in the form of an inverted cone. Its height is 8 cm and the radius of its top, which is open, is 5 cm. It is filled with water up to the brim. When lead shots, each of which is a sphere of radius 0.5 cm are dropped into the vessel, one-fourth of the water flows out. Find the number of lead shots dropped in the vessel. Fig. 12.16 . Asolid iron pole consists ofa cylinder of height 220 cm and base diameter 24 cm, which is surmounted by another cylinder of height 60 cm and radius 8 cm. Find the mass of the pole, given that 1 cm? of iron has approximately 8g mass. (Use tm = 3.14) . Asolid consisting of a right circular cone of height 120 cm and radius 60 cm standing on a hemisphere of radius 60 cm is placed upright in a right circular cylinder full of water such that it touches the bottom. Find the volume of water left in
