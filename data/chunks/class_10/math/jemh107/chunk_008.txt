Find the coordinates of the points of trisection of the line segment joining (4, 1) and ( 2, 3). your rectangular shaped school ground ABCD, lines have been drawn with chalk powder at a distance of 1m each. 100 flower pots have been placed at a distance of 1m from each other along AD, as shown in Fig. 7.12. Niharika runs a th the distance AD on the 2nd line and posts a green flag. Preet runs 5 th the distance AD on the eighth line and posts a red flag. What is the distance between both the flags? If Rashmi has to posta blue flag exactly halfway between the line segment 12345 678 9 10 joining the two flags, where should ; she post her flag? Fig. 7.12 . Find the ratio in which the line segment joining the points ( 3, 10) and (6, 8) is divided by (- 1,6). . Find the ratio in which the line segment joining A(1, 5) and B( 4, 5) is divided by the x-axis. Also find the coordinates of the point of division. . If, 2), (4,7), (x, 6) and (3, 5) are the vertices of a parallelogram taken in order, find x and y. . Find the coordinates of a point A, where AB is the diameter of a circle whose centre is (2, 3) and B is (1, 4). . If Aand B are ( 2, 2) and (2, 4), respectively, find the coordinates of P such that 3 ; ; AP = 7 AB and P lies on the line segment AB. . Find the coordinates of the points which divide the line segment joining A( 2, 2) and B(, 8) into four equal parts. Find the area of a rhombus if its vertices are (3, 0), (4, 5), ( 1, 4) and ( 2, 1) taken in order.
