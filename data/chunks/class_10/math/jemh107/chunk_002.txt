PT from the Fig? 7.3 point P on QS (extended) to meet y-axis at the point R. Fig. 7.4 Then PT = 11 units and QT = 7 units. (Why?) Using the Pythagoras Theorem to the right triangle PTQ, we get PQ= 17 +7 > = 170 units. Reprint 2025-26 102 MATHEMATICS Let us now find the distance between any two Y points P(x,, y,) and Q(x,, y,). Draw PR and QS perpendicular to the x-axis. A perpendicular from the point P on QS is drawn to meet it at the point T (see Fig. 7.5). Then, OR=x,,OS=x,. So, RS =x, x, = PT. Also, SQ=y,, ST=PR=y,. So, QT=y,-y,. Now, applying the Pythagoras theorem in A PTQ, we get PQ? = PT? + QT ~ (x, x,) + (y, yy Therefore, PQ= nee - x,) +(y.- v4) Note that since distance is always non-negative, we take only the positive square root. So, the distance between the points P(x,, y,) and Q(x,, y,) 1s PQ= \(a- x) +(y)- 1) which is called the distance formula. Q(X), V2) Remarks : 1. In particular, the distance of a point P(x, y) from the origin O(0, 0) is given by OP = J/x? +)". 2. We can also write, PQ = | (x,- x) + (4, 3)? - (Why?) Example 1 : Do the points (3, 2), (-2, 3) and (2, 3) form a triangle? If so, name the type of triangle formed. Solution : Let us apply the distance formula to find the distances PQ, QR and PR, where P(3, 2), Q( 2, 3) and R(2, 3) are the given points. We have PQ = J(G4+2) +(24+3) = [5 +5? = /50 = 7.07 (approx.) QR = (2-2) +3 -3)? = 4-4) + C6)? = V52 = 7.21 (approx.) PR= (3-2)? +(2 3) = fr 4 (-1)? =J2 = 1.41 (approx.) Since the sum of any two of these distances is greater than the third distance, therefore, the points P, Q and R form a triangle. Reprint 2025-26 COORDINATE GEOMETRY 103 Also, PQ? + PR? = QR , by the converse of Pythagoras theorem, we have Z P = 90 . Therefore, PQR is a right triangle. Example 2 : Show that the points (1, 7), (4, 2), (-1, -1) and ( 4, 4) are the vertices of a square. Solution : Let AC, 7), B(4, 2), C(-1, -1) and D( 4, 4) be the given points. One way of showing that ABCD is a square is to use the property that all its sides should be equal and both its digonals should also be equal. Now, AB =,/(1 4) + (7-2)? = 9 + 25 = 34 BC = (441)? +(2 +1)? = (2549 = 34 CD = 144)? + (-1- 4) = 9 +25 = 34 AC = 41? +(7+ 1? = J4 46 BD = (4447 + (2-4 = (6444 = VO8 Since, AB = BC = CD = DA and AC = BD, all the four sides of the
