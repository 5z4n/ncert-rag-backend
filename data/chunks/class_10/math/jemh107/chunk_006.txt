If the ratio in which P divides AB is k : 1, then the coordinates of the point P will be [Anta ky, + i} k+1 k+1 Special Case : The mid-point of a line segment divides the line segment in the ratio 1: 1. Therefore, the coordinates of the mid-point P of the join of the points A(x,, y,) and B(x,, y,) is Ix, +1-x, ly tly.)

Solution : Let P(x, y) be the required point. Using the section formula, we get 28)+14)_ 7 _ 3O)t IC) _, Le? ee Therefore, (7, 3) is the required point. Example 7 : In what ratio does the point ( 4, 6) divide the line segment joining the points A( 6, 10) and B(3, 8)? Solution : Let ( 4, 6) divide AB internally in the ratio m, : m,. Using the section formula, we get 3m, 6m, 8m, + nad a) m+ mM, mM, +m, Recall that if (x, vy) = (a, b) then x =a andy=b. So, 4= 3m, 6m, and 6= 8m, + 10m, m, +m, m +m, 3m, 6m, ; Now, 4= gives us m, +m, 4m, 4m, = 3m, 6m, Le., 7m, = 2m, Le., m,:m,=2:7 You should verify that the ratio satisfies the y-coordinate also. -3 "1 +10 8m, + 10m, mM, Now, = ___ (Dividing throughout by m,) m, +m, may Reprint 2025-26 COORDINATE GEOMETRY 109 Therefore, the point ( 4, 6) divides the line segment joining the points A( 6, 10) and B(3, 8) in the ratio 2: 7. Alternatively : The ratio m, : m, can also be written as m :1, ork: 1. Let (4, 6) mM, divide AB internally in the ratio k : 1. Using the section formula, we get 46 3k- 6 8k+10 (2) 4, 6) k+1 k+l So, _4= 3k - 6 k+1 L.e., ~4k-4= 3k-6 1. ., Tk =2 1. ., k:1=2:7 You can check for the y-coordinate also. So, the point ( 4, 6) divides the line segment joining the points A( 6, 10) and B(3, 8) in the ratio 2: 7. Note : You can also find this ratio by calculating the distances PA and PB and taking their ratios provided you know that A, P and B are collinear. Example 8 : Find the coordinates of the points of trisection (i.e., points dividing in three equal parts) of the line segment joining the points A(2, 2) and B( 7, 4). Solution : Let P and Q be the points of A
