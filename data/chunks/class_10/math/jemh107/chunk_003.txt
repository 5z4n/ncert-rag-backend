its sides should be equal and both its digonals should also be equal. Now, AB =,/(1 4) + (7-2)? = 9 + 25 = 34 BC = (441)? +(2 +1)? = (2549 = 34 CD = 144)? + (-1- 4) = 9 +25 = 34 AC = 41? +(7+ 1? = J4 46 BD = (4447 + (2-4 = (6444 = VO8 Since, AB = BC = CD = DA and AC = BD, all the four sides of the quadrilateral ABCD are equal and its diagonals AC and BD are also equal. Thereore, ABCD is a square. Alternative Solution : We find the four sides and one diagonal, say, AC as above. Here AD? + DC? = 34+ 34 = 68 = AC . Therefore, by the converse of Pythagoras theorem, Z D = 90 . A quadrilateral with all four sides equal and one angle 90 is a square. So, ABCD is a square. \o Blo+ | Co) aI ioe) & Rows Example 3: Fig. 7.6 shows the arrangement of desks in a classroom.

Reprint 2025-26 104 MATHEMATICS Solution : Using the distance formula, we have AB = (6-3)? +(4-1)? = 9 +9 = Vi8 =3V2 BC = (8 6)? + (6 4)? =,/4+4 = v8 =2V2 AC = (8 3)? + (6-1)? = /25 + 25 = 50 =5/2 Since, AB + BC = 3/2 + 2/2 =5,2 = AC, we can say that the points A, B and C are collinear. Therefore, they are seated in a line. Example 4 : Find a relation between x and y such that the point (x , y) is equidistant from the points (7, 1) and (3, 5). Solution : Let P(x, y) be equidistant from the points A(7, 1) and B(3, 5). We are given that AP = BP. So, AP? = BP? 1. ., (x-7/P +@-1P = @~=-3P +(-5)/ Le., x 14" + 494+y -2y4+ 1 =x? -6x+9+y 10y4+ 25 1. ., x=y=2 which is the required relation. Y Remark : Note that the graph of the equation x y =2/18a line. From your earlier studies, you know that a point which is equidistant from A and B lies on the perpendicular bisector of AB. Therefore, the graph of x y=2 is the perpendicular bisector of AB (see Fig. 7.7). = nw w hu HA ~] Example 5 : Find a point on the y-axis which is equidistant from the points A(6, 5) and B(-4, 3). Solution : We know that a point on the 5 y-axis is of the form (0, y). So, let the point + P(0, y) be equidistant from A and B.
