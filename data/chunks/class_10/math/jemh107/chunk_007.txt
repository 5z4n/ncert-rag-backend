10) and B(3, 8) in the ratio 2: 7. Note : You can also find this ratio by calculating the distances PA and PB and taking their ratios provided you know that A, P and B are collinear. Example 8 : Find the coordinates of the points of trisection (i.e., points dividing in three equal parts) of the line segment joining the points A(2, 2) and B( 7, 4). Solution : Let P and Q be the points of A P Q B trisection of AB i.e., AP = PQ = QB (2, -2) (-7, 4) (see Fig. 7.11). Fig. 7.11 Therefore, P divides AB internally in the ratio 1 : 2. Therefore, the coordinates of P, by applying the section formula, are \(-7) + 2(2) 1(4) + 2(-2) 142. 142. bes CLO) Now, Q also divides AB internally in the ratio 2 : 1. So, the coordinates of Q are 2(-7) +1(2) 2(4) + 1(-2) 241 241. debe 4,2) Reprint 2025-26 110 MATHEMATICS Therefore, the coordinates of the points of trisection of the line segment joining A and B are ( 1, 0) and (- 4, 2). Note : We could also have obtained Q by noting that it is the mid-point of PB. So, we could have obtained its coordinates using the mid-point formula. Example 9 : Find the ratio in which the y-axis divides the line segment joining the points (5, 6) and ( 1, 4). Also find the point of intersection. Solution : Let the ratio be & : 1. Then by the section formula, the coordinates of the point which divides AB in the ratio : 1 are [= +5 4k ~ s} k+l k+l This point lies on the y-axis, and we know that on the y-axis the abscissa is 0. Theref k+5 _ erefore, kal So, k=5 That is, the ratio is 5 : 1. Putting the value of k= 5, we get the point of intersection as Example 10 : If the points A(6, 1), B(8, 2), C(9, 4) and D(y, 3) are the vertices of a parallelogram, taken in order, find the value of p. Solution : We know that diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. So, the coordinates of the mid-point of AC = coordinates of the mid-point of BD . 6+9 14+4 _ 8+ p 24+3 15 5 8+p 5 IS 8+p 80, 2 2 Le., p=7 Reprint 2025-26 COORDINATE GEOMETRY 111 1. 10. .
