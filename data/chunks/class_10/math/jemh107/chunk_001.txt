be represented graphically as shown in Fig. 7.1. You may use the Pythagoras Theorem to calculate this distance. Now, suppose two points lie on the x-axis. Can we find the distance between them? For instance, consider two points A(4, 0) and B(6, 0) in Fig. 7.2. The points A and B lie on the x-axis. From the figure you can see that OA = 4 units and OB = 6 units. Therefore, the distance of B from A, i.e., AB = OB - OA = 6-4 = 2 units. So, if two points lie on the x-axis, we can easily find the distance between them. Now, suppose we take two points lying on the y-axis. Can you find the distance between them. If the points C(O, 3) and D(0, 8) lie on the y-axis, similarly we find that CD = 8 3 =5 units (see Fig. 7.2). _ Nw hm HA 1 MATHEMATICS North Fig. 7.1 B x 1 2 3/74 5 6 (4/0) Noo Fig. 7.2 Next, can you find the distance of A from C (in Fig. 7.2)? Since OA = 4 units and OC = 3 units, the distance of A from C, i.e., AC = ./3 + 4 =5 units. Similarly, you can find the distance of B from D = BD = 10 units. Now, if we consider two points not lying on coordinate axis, can we find the distance between them? Yes! We shall use Pythagoras theorem to do so. Let us see an example. In Fig. 7.3, the points P(4, 6) and Q(6, 8) lie in the first quadrant. How do we use Pythagoras theorem to find the distance between them? Let us draw PR and QS perpendicular to the x-axis from P and Q respectively. Also, draw a perpendicular from P on QS to meet QS at T. Then the coordinates of R and S are (4, 0) and (6, 0), respectively. So, RS = 2 units. Also, QS = 8 units and TS = PR = 6 units.

Now, using the Pythagoras theorem, we 8 have 7 PQ? = PT? + QT 6 T =2?+2 =8 So, PQ = 2,/2 units 3 How will we find the distance between two 2 points in two different quadrants? 5 Consider the points P(6, 4) and Q(-5, -3) 12 3s 3 ONG. (see Fig. 7.4). Draw QS perpendicular to the (4, 0) x-axis. Also draw a perpendicular PT from the Fig? 7.3 point P on QS (extended) to meet y-axis at the point R. Fig. 7.4 Then PT = 11 units and QT = 7 units. (Why?) Using the Pythagoras Theorem to the right triangle PTQ, we get PQ= 17 +7 > = 170 units.
