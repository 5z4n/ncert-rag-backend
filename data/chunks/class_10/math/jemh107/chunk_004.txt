Solution : We know that a point on the 5 y-axis is of the form (0, y). So, let the point + P(0, y) be equidistant from A and B. Then Fig. 7.7 (6-0 +(S-yP= ( 4-0P + B-yY i.e., 36+25+y - 10y = 16+9+y? by ie. Ay = 36 1. ., y=9 Reprint 2025-26 COORDINATE GEOMETRY 105 So, the required point is (0, 9). Let us check our solution: AP = ,/(6 0)? +(5 9)* = 36 +16 =J/52 = J 4-0) + 3-9) = 16 + 36 = V52 Note : Using the remark above, we see that (0, 9) is the intersection of the y-axis and the perpendicular bisector of AB.

Find a relation between x and y such that the point (x, y) is equidistant from the point (3, 6) and ( 3, 4). 7.3 Section Formula Let us recall the situation in Section 7.2. Suppose a telephone company wants to position a relay tower at P between A and B is such a way that the distance of the tower from B is twice its distance from A. If P lies on AB, it will divide AB in the ratio 1 : 2 (see Fig. 7.9). If we take A as the origin O, and 1
