point (3, 6) and ( 3, 4). 7.3 Section Formula Let us recall the situation in Section 7.2. Suppose a telephone company wants to position a relay tower at P between A and B is such a way that the distance of the tower from B is twice its distance from A. If P lies on AB, it will divide AB in the ratio 1 : 2 (see Fig. 7.9). If we take A as the origin O, and 1 km as one unit on both the axis, the coordinates of B will be (36, 15). In order to know the position of the tower, we must know the coordinates of P. How do we find these coordinates? Fig. 7.9 Let the coordinates of P be (x, y). Draw perpendiculars from P and B to the x-axis, meeting it in D and E, respectively. Draw PC perpendicular to BE. Then, by the AA similarity criterion, studied in Chapter 6, A POD and A BPC are similar. OD OP 1 PD OP 1 PC PB 2 " BC PB 2 Therefore , So, t~=1+ and 22% 36-x 2 IS-y 2 These equations give x = 12 and y=5S. You can check that P(12, 5) meets the condition that OP : PB=1: 2. Now let us use the understanding that you may have developed through this example to obtain the general formula. Consider any two points A(x,, y,) and B(x,, y,) and assume that P (x, y) divides AB internally in the ratio m, : m,, i.e., PA . 4m (see Fig. 7.10). PB m, 2?

Then, by the AA similarity criterion, A PAQ ~ A BPC PA AQ _ PQ Therefore, BP. PC BC (1) Now, AQ =RS = OS OR =x x, PC =ST=OT-OS=x,-x PQ = PS QS= PS AR=y- y, BC = BT- CT = BT- PS=y, -y Substituting these values in (1), we get m _ *=H _ITM M = %%7~X Y,2-y m xx MX, + mx Taking a | we get x= At2 oA mM Xy xX m, + Mm, imi m yoy my, +m Similarly, taking = we get y = MYo Mi mM = Io27V m, +m, So, the coordinates of the point P(x, y) which divides the line segment joining the points A(x,, y,) and B(x,, y,), internally, in the ratio m, : m, are (2) [m8 + Myx, , My, + ma m, +m, m, +m, This is known as the section formula. This can also be derived by drawing perpendiculars from A, P and B on the y-axis and proceeding as above. If the ratio in which P divides AB is k : 1, then the coordinates of the point P will be [Anta ky, + i} k+1 k+1 Special Case : The mid-point of a line segment divides the line segment in the ratio 1: 1. Therefore, the coordinates
