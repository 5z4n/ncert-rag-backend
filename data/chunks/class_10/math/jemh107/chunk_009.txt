The mid-point of the line segment joining the points P(x,, y,) and Q(,, y,) is Mt Mt Vo 2 2 : ANOTE TO THE READER Section 7.3 discusses the Section Formula for the coordinates (x, y) of a point P which divides internally the line segment joining the points A(x,,y,) and B(x,, y,) in the ratio m, : m, as follows : ONE gh Sy yi m + M), m + My, Note that, here, PA: PB =m, : m,. However, if P does not lie between A and B but lies on the line AB, outside the line segment AB, and PA: PB=m, : m,, we say that P divides externally the line segment joining the points A and B. You will study Section Formula for such case in higher classes. Reprint 2025-26
