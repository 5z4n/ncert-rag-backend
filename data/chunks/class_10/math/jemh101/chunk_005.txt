p,, p,,...,p,. SO p is one of p,, P,, - . 5 P, Now, since a = p, p,...P,, p divides a. We are now ready to give a proof that ./2 is irrational. The proof is based on a technique called proof by contradiction . (This technique is discussed in some detail in Appendix 1). Theorem 1.3 : //2 is irrational. Proof : Let us assume, to the contrary, that ./2 is rational. * Not from the examination point of view. Reprint 2025-26 REAL NUMBERS 7 r So, we can find integers r and s (# 0) such that ./2 = . Suppose 7 and s have a common factor other than 1. Then, we divide by the common factor to get ./2 - @ | where a and b are coprime. b So, b./2 =a. Squaring on both sides and rearranging, we get 2b = a . Therefore, 2 divides a . Now, by Theorem 1.2, it follows that 2 divides a. So, we can write a = 2c for some integer c. Substituting for a, we get 2b? = 4c , that is, b? = 2c . This means that 2 divides b , and so 2 divides b (again using Theorem 1.2 with p = 2). Therefore, a and b have at least 2 as a common factor. But this contradicts the fact that a and b have no common factors other than 1. This contradiction has arisen because of our incorrect assumption that ./2 is rational. So, we conclude that ./2 is irrational. Example 5 : Prove that /3 is irrational. Solution : Let us assume, to the contrary, that V3 is rational. a b Suppose a and b have a common factor other than 1, then we can divide by the common factor, and assume that a and b are coprime. So, bV3 =a: Squaring on both sides, and rearranging, we get 3b? = a . That is, we can find integers a and b (#0) such that /3 = Therefore, a is divisible by 3, and by Theorem 1.2, it follows that a is also divisible by 3. So, we can write a = 3c for some integer c. Substituting for a, we get 3b = 9c , that is, b? = 3c . This means that 5 is divisible by 3, and so 5 is also divisible by 3 (using Theorem 1.2 with p = 3). Reprint 2025-26 8 MATHEMATICS Therefore, a and b have at least 3 as a common factor. But this contradicts the fact that a and b are coprime. This contradiction has arisen because of our incorrect assumption that ./3 is rational. So, we conclude that /3 is irrational. In Class IX, we mentioned that : e@ the sum or difference of a rational and an irrational number is irrational and e the product and quotient of a non-zero rational and irrational number is irrational. We prove some particular cases here. Example 6 : Show that 5 J3
