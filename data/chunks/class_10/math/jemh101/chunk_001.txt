23. If we multiply some or all of these numbers, allowing them to repeat as many times as we wish, we can produce a large collection of positive integers (In fact, infinitely many). Let us list a few : 7x 11x23=1771 3x 7x 11 x 23=5313 2x3x7x 11x23 = 10626 23? x 3x 7 = 8232 2?x3x7x 11x 23=21252 and so on. Now, let us suppose your collection of primes includes all the possible primes. What is your guess about the size of this collection? Does it contain only a finite number of integers, or infinitely many? Infact, there are infinitely many primes. So, if we combine all these primes in all possible ways, we will get an infinite collection of numbers, all the primes and all possible products of primes. The question is can we produce all the composite numbers this way? What do you think? Do you think that there may be a composite number which is not the product of powers of primes? Before we answer this, let us factorise positive integers, that is, do the opposite of what we have done so far. We are going to use the factor tree with which you are all familiar. Let us take some large number, say, 32760, and factorise it as shown. Reprint 2025-26 REAL NUMBERS 3 So we have factorised 32760 as 2 x 2x2*3x3x5x7~x 13 asa product of primes, i.e., 32760 = 23 x 3? x 5 x 7 x 13 as a product of powers of primes. Let us try another number, say, 123456789. This can be written as 3 x 3803 x 3607. Of course, you have to check that 3803 and 3607 are primes! (Try it out for several other natural numbers yourself.) This leads us to a conjecture that every composite number can be written as the product of powers of primes. In fact, this statement is true, and is called the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic because of its basic crucial importance to the study of integers. Let us now formally state this theorem. Theorem 1.1 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic) : Every composite number can be expressed (factorised) as a product of primes, and this factorisation is unique, apart from the order in which the prime factors occur. An equivalent version of Theorem 1.2 was probably first recorded as Proposition 14 of Book IX in Euclid s Elements, before it came to be known as the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. However, the first correct proof was given by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. Carl Friedrich Gauss 1s often referred to as the Prince of Mathematicians and is considered one of the three greatest mathematicians of all time, along with Archimedes and Newton. He has made fundamental Carl Friedrich Gauss contributions to both mathematics and science. (1777 1855) The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic says that every composite number can be factorised as a product of primes. Actually it says more. It says that given any composite number it can be factorised
