But this contradicts the fact that a and b are coprime. This contradiction has arisen because of our incorrect assumption that ./3 is rational. So, we conclude that /3 is irrational. In Class IX, we mentioned that : e@ the sum or difference of a rational and an irrational number is irrational and e the product and quotient of a non-zero rational and irrational number is irrational. We prove some particular cases here. Example 6 : Show that 5 J3 is irrational. Solution : Let us assume, to the contrary, that 5 V3 is rational. That is, we can find coprime a and b (b #0) such that 5 /3 = a Therefore, 5 ; - 3. Rearranging this equation, we get 3 =5 nS Sa ce b b Since a and b are integers, we get 5 jis rational, and so J3 is rational. b But this contradicts the fact that V3 is irrational. This contradiction has arisen because of our incorrect assumption that 5 V3 is rational. So, we conclude that 5 V3 is irrational. Example 7 : Show that 32 is irrational. Solution : Let us assume, to the contrary, that 3/2 is rational. That is, we can find coprime a and b (b # 0) such that 3/2 = a a 3b a Since 3, a and b are integers, 3b is rational, and so ./2 is rational. Rearranging, we get /2 = Reprint 2025-26 REAL NUMBERS But this contradicts the fact that ./2 is irrational. So, we conclude that 3/2 is irrational. EXERCISE 1.2 1. Prove that ./5 is irrational. 2. Prove that 3+ 25 is irrational. 3. Prove that the following are irrationals : (i s (i) 7J5 (ii) 6 + 2 1.4 Summary In this chapter, you have studied the following points: 1. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic : Every composite number can be expressed (factorised) as a product of primes, and this factorisation is unique, apart from the order in which the prime factors occur. . Ifpisa prime and p divides a , then p divides a, where a is a positive integer. 3. To prove that V2, 3 are irrationals. A NOTE TO THE READER You have seen that : HCF (p, g, r) x LCM (p, g, r) #p x q x r, where p, q, r are positive integers (see Example 8).
