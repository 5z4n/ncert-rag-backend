Suppose they both start at the Reprint 2025-26 6 MATHEMATICS same point and at the same time, and go in the same direction. After how many minutes will they meet again at the starting point? 1.3 Revisiting Irrational Numbers In Class IX, you were introduced to irrational numbers and many of their properties. You studied about their existence and how the rationals and the irrationals together made up the real numbers. You even studied how to locate irrationals on the number line. However, we did not prove that they were irrationals. In this section, we will prove that /2, /3, J/5 and, in general, Jp is irrational, where p is a prime. One of the theorems, we use in our proof, is the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Recall, a number s is called irrational if it cannot be written in the form Pp. where p and g are integers and g # 0. Some examples of irrational numbers, with which you are already familiar, are : 2, V3, Vis, x, -22. o10110111011110... ete. B Before we prove that ./2 is irrational, we need the following theorem, whose proof is based on the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Theorem 1.2 : Let p be a prime number. If p divides a , then p divides a, where a is a positive integer. *Proof : Let the prime factorisation of a be as follows : a=pp,.--P,, where p,,p,, ..., Pp, are primes, not necessarily distinct. Therefore, a = (p,p,.--P,)(P\P, +--+ P,) = PiPS + + Pe Now, we are given that p divides a . Therefore, from the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, it follows that p is one of the prime factors of a*. However, using the uniqueness part of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, we realise that the only prime factors of a are p,, p,,...,p,. SO p is one of p,, P,, - . 5 P, Now, since a = p, p,...P,, p divides a. We are now ready to give a proof that ./2 is irrational. The proof is based on a technique called proof by contradiction . (This technique is discussed in some detail in Appendix 1). Theorem 1.3 : //2 is irrational. Proof : Let us assume, to the contrary, that ./2 is rational. * Not from the examination point
