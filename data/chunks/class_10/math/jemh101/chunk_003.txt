integers using the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic in earlier classes, without realising it! This method is also called the prime factorisation method. Let us recall this method through an example. Example 2 : Find the LCM and HCF of 6 and 20 by the prime factorisation method. Solution : We have : 6 =2!x 3! and 20=2x2x5=2?x 5). You can find HCF(6, 20) = 2 and LCM(6, 20) = 2 x 2 x 3 x 5 = 60, as done in your earlier classes. Note that HCF(6, 20) = 2!'= Product of the smallest power of each common prime factor in the numbers. LCM (6, 20) = 2? x 3' x 5' = Product of the greatest power of each prime factor, involved in the numbers. From the example above, you might have noticed that HCF(6, 20) x LCM(6, 20) = 6 x 20. In fact, we can verify that for any two positive integers a and b, HCF (a, b) x LCM (a, b) =a x b. We can use this result to find the LCM of two positive integers, if we have already found the HCF of the two positive integers. Example 3: Find the HCF of 96 and 404 by the prime factorisation method. Hence, find their LCM. Reprint 2025-26 REAL NUMBERS 5 Solution : The prime factorisation of 96 and 404 gives : 96 =2 x 3, 404=2?x 101 Therefore, the HCF of these two integers is 2? = 4. 96x404 96x 404 = = 9696 HCF(96, 404) 4 Also, LCM (96, 404) = Example 4: Find the HCF and LCM of 6, 72 and 120, using the prime factorisation method. Solution : We have : 6=2 x 3, 72=2? x 37, 120=27x3 x5 Here, 2' and 3! are the smallest powers of the common factors 2 and 3, respectively. So, HCF (6, 72, 120) = 2! x 3!=2x3=6 23, 3? and 5! are the greatest powers of the prime factors 2, 3 and 5 respectively involved in the three numbers. So, LCM (6, 72, 120) = 23x 3? x 5'= 360 Remark : Notice, 6 x 72 x 120 # HCF (6, 72, 120) x LCM (6, 72, 120). So, the product of three numbers is not equal to the product of their HCF and LCM.
