x (-D} -4=0 Also, note that p(4)=47-(3 x 4)-4=0. As p(-1) = 0 and p(4) = 0, -1 and 4 are called the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial x* 3x 4. More generally, a real number k is said to be a zero of a polynomial p(x), if p( ) = 0. You have already studied in Class IX, how to find the zeroes of a linear polynomial. For example, if k is a zero of p(x) = 2x + 3, then p(k) = 0 gives us 2k+3=0,1e,k= > In general, if k is a zero of p(x) = ax + b, then p(k) = ak+ b=0,ie., k= 7 So, the zero of the linear polynomial ax + b is mu = (Constant term) a Coefficient of x Thus, the zero of a linear polynomial is related to its coefficients. Does this happen in the case of other polynomials too? For example, are the zeroes of a quadratic polynomial also related to its coefficients? In this chapter, we will try to answer these questions. We will also study the division algorithm for polynomials. 2.2 Geometrical Meaning of the Zeroes of a Polynomial You know that a real number k is a zero of the polynomial p(x) if p(k) = 0. But why are the zeroes of a polynomial so important? To answer this, first we will see the geometrical representations of linear and quadratic polynomials and the geometrical meaning of their zeroes. Reprint 2025-26 12 MATHEMATICS Consider first a linear polynomial ax + b, a # 0. You have studied in Class IX that the graph of y = ax + b isa straight line. For example, the graph of y = 2x + 3 is a straight line passing through the points ( 2, 1) and (2, 7). From Fig. 2.1, you can see that the graph of y = 2x + 3 intersects the x-axis mid-way between x = 1 and x = 2, that is, at the point [-3. 0), You also know that the zero of 2x + 3 is ->. Thus, the zero of the polynomial 2x + 3 is the x-coordinate of the point where the graph of y = 2x + 3 intersects the Fig. 2.1 X-axis. In general, for a linear polynomial ax + b, a #0, the graph of y= ax + bisa straight line which intersects the x-axis at exactly one point, namely, . 0). a Therefore, the linear polynomial ax + b, a # 0, has exactly one zero, namely, the x-coordinate of the point where the graph of y = ax + b intersects the x-axis. Now, let us look for the geometrical meaning of a zero of a quadratic polynomial. Consider the quadratic polynomial x* 3x 4. Let us see what the graph* of y =x 3x 4 looks like. Let us list a few values of y =x? 3x 4 corresponding to a few values for x as given in Table 2.1. * Plotting of graphs
