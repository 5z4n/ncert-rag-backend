5x- 2 = 3x? + 6x x 2 = 3x(x + 2) -1(x + 2) = (3x 1)(x + 2) Hence, the value of 3x? + 5x 2 is zero when either 3x - 1 =0 orx +2 =0, ie., 1 1 when x = 3 or x = 2. So, the zeroes of 3x? + 5x 2 are 3 and 2. Observe that : S Fit I +(~2) -5 _ (Coefficient of x) um Of 1tS zer = = = oS 3 3 Coefficient of x7 2 _ Constant term 3 Coefficient of x? Product of its zeroes = 3 x (=2)= In general, if * and B* are the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial p(x) = ax? + bx +c, a #0, then you know that x o and x B are the factors of p(x). Therefore, ax* + bx + c = k(x a) (x B), where k is a constant = kx?

Example 2 : Find the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial x? + 7x + 10, and verify the relationship between the zeroes and the coefficients. Solution : We have x + 7x + 10=(x + 2)(x + 5) So, the value of x* + 7x + 10 is zero when x + 2=0 orx +5 =0, i.e., when x = 2 or x =~ 5. Therefore, the zeroes of x? + 7x + 10 are 2 and 5.

Solution : Recall the identity a b? = (a b)(a + b). Using it, we can write: ean (Blof) So, the value of x? 3 is zero when x = V3 orx = J3 Therefore, the zeroes of x? 3 are /3 and ,/3.
