Polynomials of degrees 1, 2 and 3 are called linear, quadratic and cubic polynomials respectively. 2. A quadratic polynomial in x with real coefficients is of the form ax + bx + c, where a, b,c are real numbers with a #0. 3. The zeroes of a polynomial p(x) are precisely the x- coordinates of the points, where the graph of y = p(x) intersects the x-axis. 4. A quadratic polynomial can have at most 2 zeroes and a cubic polynomial can have at most 3 zeroes. 5. If and Bare the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial ax? + bx + c, then a+B= ", op=<. a a 6.
