the value of x? 3 is zero when x = V3 orx = J3 Therefore, the zeroes of x? 3 are /3 and ,/3. Now, \3=0= (Coefficient of x) sum of zeroes = 3 - 5 Coefficient of x 3 Constant term product of zeroes = (v3)( V3) =-3= 1 Coefficient of 2 Reprint 2025-26 POLYNOMIALS 21 Example 4 : Find a quadratic polynomial, the sum and product of whose zeroes are 3 and 2, respectively. Solution : Let the quadratic polynomial be ax? + bx + c, and its zeroes be o and B. We have b +8R=- 3= By at+B 3 7 c d op =2= : an B 7 Ifa=1, then b =3 andc=2. So, one quadratic polynomial which fits the given conditions is x? + 3x + 2. You can check that any other quadratic polynomial that fits these conditions will be of the form k(x? + 3x + 2), where x is real. Let us now look at cubic polynomials. Do you think a similar relation holds between the zeroes of a cubic polynomial and its coefficients? Let us consider p(x) = 2x3 5x? 14x + 8. You can check that p(x) = 0 for x = 4, 2, ; - Since p(x) can have atmost three zeroes, these are the zeores of 2x* 5x? 14x + 8.

Example 5* : Verify that 3, -1, ~3 are the zeroes of the cubic polynomial P(x) = 3x3 5x* 11x 3, and then verify the relationship between the zeroes and the coefficients. Solution : Comparing the given polynomial with ax? + bx? + cx +d, we get a=3,b= 5,c=-ll1,d=- 3. Further p(3) =3 x 33-(5 x 3 ) (11 3) 3 = 81 45 33-3 =0, p(-l) =3 x (13-5 x CL? 11 x Cl) -3 =-3-54+ 11-3 =0, Therefore, 3, -1 and = are the zeroes of 3x 5x 11x 3.
