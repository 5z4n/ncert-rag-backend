general, given a polynomial p(x) of degree n, the graph of y = p(x) intersects the x-axis at atmost 7 points. Therefore, a polynomial p(x) of degree n has at most 1 zeroes. Example 1 : Look at the graphs in Fig. 2.9 given below. Each is the graph of y = p(x), where p(x) is a polynomial. For each of the graphs, find the number of zeroes of p(x).

We will now try a to answer the question raised in Section 2.1 regarding the relationship between zeroes and coefficients of a quadratic polynomial. For this, let us take a quadratic polynomial, say p(x) = 2x? 8x + 6. In Class IX, you have learnt how to factorise quadratic polynomials by splitting the middle term. So, here we need to split the middle term _ 8x as a sum of two terms, whose product is 6 x 2x? = 12x . So, we write 2x? 8x + 6 = 2x? 6x 2x + 6 = 2x(x 3) 2(x 3) = (2x 2)(x 3) = 2(x 1) - 3) Reprint 2025-26 POLYNOMIALS 19 So, the value of p(x) = 2x? 8x + 6 is zero when x 1 = 0 or x 3 = 0, i.e., when x = 1 orx =3. So, the zeroes of 2x? 8x + 6 are | and 3. Observe that : (-8) _ (Coefficient of x) 2 Coefficient of x 6 Constant term Product of its zeroes = 1X3 =3= = 2 Coefficient of x? Sum ofits zeroes = 14+3=4= Let us take one more quadratic polynomial, say, p(x) = 3x + 5x 2. By the method of splitting the middle term, 3x? + 5x- 2 = 3x? + 6x x 2 = 3x(x + 2) -1(x + 2) = (3x 1)(x + 2) Hence, the value of 3x? + 5x 2 is zero when either 3x - 1 =0 orx +2 =0, ie., 1 1 when x = 3 or x = 2. So, the zeroes of 3x? + 5x 2 are 3 and 2. Observe that : S Fit I +(~2) -5 _ (Coefficient of x) um Of 1tS zer = =
