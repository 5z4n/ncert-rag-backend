namely, the x-coordinate of the point where the graph of y = ax + b intersects the x-axis. Now, let us look for the geometrical meaning of a zero of a quadratic polynomial. Consider the quadratic polynomial x* 3x 4. Let us see what the graph* of y =x 3x 4 looks like. Let us list a few values of y =x? 3x 4 corresponding to a few values for x as given in Table 2.1. * Plotting of graphs of quadratic or cubic polynomials is not meant to be done by the students, nor is to be evaluated. Reprint 2025-26 POLYNOMIALS 13 Table 2.1 If we locate the points listed above on a graph paper and draw the graph, it will actually look like the one given in Fig. 2.2. In fact, for any quadratic polynomial ax? + bx + c,a #0, the graph of the corresponding equation y = ax? + bx + c has one of the two shapes either open upwards like \J or open downwards like (\ depending on whether a > 0 or a < 0. (These curves are called parabolas.) You can see from Table 2.1 that 1 and 4 are zeroes of the quadratic polynomial. Also note from Fig. 2.2 that 1 and 4 are the x-coordinates of the points where the graph of y = x? 3x-4 intersects the x-axis. Thus, the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial x? 3x 4 are x-coordinates of the points where the graph of y = x? 3x 4 intersects the X-axis. Fig. 2.2 This fact is true for any quadratic polynomial, i.e., the zeroes of a quadratic polynomial ax + bx + c,a #0, are precisely the x-coordinates of the points where the parabola representing y = ax? + bx +c intersects the x-axis. From our observation earlier about the shape of the graph of y = ax? + bx +c, the following three cases can happen: Reprint 2025-26 14 MATHEMATICS Case (i) : Here, the graph cuts x-axis at two distinct points A and A . The x-coordinates of A and A are the two zeroes of the quadratic polynomial ax? + bx + c in this case (see Fig. 2.3). (i) (ii) Fig. 2.3 Case (ii) : Here, the graph cuts the x-axis at exactly one point, 1.e., at two coincident points. So, the two points A and A of Case (i) coincide here to become one point A (see Fig. 2.4). (i) (ii) Fig. 2.4 The x-coordinate of A is the only zero for the quadratic polynomial ax? + bx +c in this case. Reprint 2025-26 POLYNOMIALS 15 Case (iii) : Here, the graph is either completely above the x-axis or completely below the x-axis. So, it does not cut the x-axis at any point (see Fig. 2.5). (i) (ii) Fig. 2.5 So, the quadratic polynomial ax? + bx + c has no zero in this case. So, you can see geometrically that a quadratic polynomial can have either two distinct zeroes
