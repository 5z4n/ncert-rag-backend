1062CHO2 POLYNOMIALS 2.1 Introduction In Class IX, you have studied polynomials in one variable and their degrees. Recall that if p(x) is a polynomial in x, the highest power of x in p(x) 1s called the degree of the polynomial p(x). For example, 4x + 2 is a polynomial in the variable x of degree 1, 2y? 3y + 4 is a polynomial in the variable y of degree 2, 5x? 4x? + x /2 is a polynomial in the variable x of degree 3 and 7u oJ + 4u +u-8 isa polynomial 5 Vx +2, > ete., are in the variable u of degree 6. Expressions like x-1 x7 +2x+3 not polynomials. A polynomial of degree | is called a linear polynomial. For example, 2x 3, V3x + 5, yt J2,x- =, 3z+4, Su +1,etc., are all linear polynomials. Polynomials such as 2x + 5 x?,x + 1, etc., are not linear polynomials. A polynomial of degree 2 is called a quadratic polynomial. The name quadratic has been derived from the word quadrate , which means square . 2x7 + 3x = y? 2, 2-x7+ Bx, =F 2u? +5, J5v? -y, 47? +e are some examples of quadratic polynomials (whose coefficients are real numbers). More generally, any quadratic polynomial in x is of the form ax? + bx +c, where a, b, c are real numbers and a # 0. A polynomial of degree 3 is called a cubic polynomial. Some examples of Reprint 2025-26 POLYNOMIALS 11 a cubic polynomial are 2 x7, x , /2x , 3-1? + x3, 3x 2x? + x 1. In fact, the most general form of a cubic polynomial is ax? + bx? + cx + d, where, a, b, c, d are real numbers and a # 0. Now consider the polynomial p(x) = x 3x 4. Then, putting x = 2 in the polynomial, we get p(2) = 2-3 x 2-4 =- 6. The value 6 , obtained by replacing x by 2 in x 3x 4, is the value of x* 3x 4 at x = 2. Similarly, p(0) is the value of P(x) at x = 0, which is 4. If p(x) is a polynomial in x, and ifk is any real number, then the value obtained by replacing x by k in p(x), is called the value of p(x) at x = k, and is denoted by p(A). What is the value of p(x) = x? -3x 4 at x = 1? We have : p(-l) = (-1?-8 x (-D} -4=0 Also, note that p(4)=47-(3 x 4)-4=0. As p(-1) = 0 and p(4) = 0, -1 and 4 are called the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial x* 3x 4. More generally, a real number k is said to be a zero of a polynomial p(x), if p( ) = 0. You have already studied in Class IX, how to find the zeroes of a linear polynomial. For example, if k is a zero of p(x) = 2x +
