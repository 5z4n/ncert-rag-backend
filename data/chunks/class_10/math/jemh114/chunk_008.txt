two numbers appearing on the top of the dice is (i) 8? (ii) 13? (iii) less than or equal to 12? Solution : When the blue die shows 1 , the grey die could show any one of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The same is true when the blue die shows 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 or 6 . The possible outcomes of the experiment are listed in the table below; the first number in each ordered pair is the number appearing on the blue die and the second number is that on the grey die.

(i) The outcomes favourable to the event the sum of the two numbers is 8 denoted by E, are: (2, 6), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3), (6,2) (see Fig. 14.3) i.e., the number of outcomes favourable to E = 5. Hence, P(E) = 36 (ii) As you can see from Fig. 14.3, there is no outcome favourable to the event F, the sum of two numbers is 13 . So, P(F) = 0 (iti) As you can see from Fig. 14.3, all the outcomes are favourable to the event G, sum of two numbers < 12 . So, PG)= 36>! Reprint 2025-26 MATHEMATICS EXERCISE 14.1 1.

(iii) The probability of an event that is certain to happen is_______. Such an event is called (iv) The sum of the probabilities of all the elementary events of an experiment is (v) The probability of an event is greater than or equal to____ and less than or equal to Which of the following experiments have equally likely outcomes? Explain. (i) Adriver attempts to start a car. The car starts or does not start. (ii) A player attempts to shoot a basketball. She/he shoots or misses the shot. (ii) A trial is made to answer a true-false question. The answer is right or wrong. (iv) A baby is born. It is a boy or a girl. . Why is tossing a coin considered to bea fair way of deciding which team should get the ball at the beginning of a football game? . Which of the following cannot be the probability of an event? (A) : (B) -1.5 (C) 15% (D) 0.7 . IfP(E)=0.05, what is the probability of not E ? . A bag contains lemon flavoured candies only. Malini takes out one candy without looking into the bag.
