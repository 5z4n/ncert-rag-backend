Reprint 2025-26 PROBABILITY 211 Let E be the event that the music is stopped within the first half-minute . . . 1 The outcomes favourable to E are points on the number line from 0 to 5 1 1 The distance from 0 to 2 is 2, while the distance from 0 to 5 iS 5 Since all the outcomes are equally likely, we can argue that, of the total distance of 2, the distance favourable to the event E is 5 Distance favourable to the event E 2 _l So, P(E) = ; - ; ee Total distance in which outcomes can lie 2 4 Can we now extend the idea of Example 10 for finding the probability as the ratio of the favourable area to the total area? Example 11* : A missing helicopter is reported to have crashed somewhere in the rectangular region shown in Fig. 14.2. What is the probability that it crashed inside the lake shown in the figure? + 2km > 9km Fig. 14.2 Solution : The helicopter is equally likely to crash anywhere in the region. Area of the entire region where the helicopter can crash = (4.5 x 9) km? = 40.5 km? * Not from the examination point of view. Reprint 2025-26 212 MATHEMATICS Area of the lake = (2.5 x 3) km* = 7.5 km? 75 75 5 Therefore, P (helicopter crashed in the lake) = 40.5 = 405 = 7 Example 12 : A carton consists of 100 shirts of which 88 are good, 8 have minor defects and 4 have major defects. Jimmy, a trader, will only accept the shirts which are good, but Sujatha, another trader, will only reject the shirts which have major defects. One shirt is drawn at random from the carton. What is the probability that (i) it is acceptable to Jimmy? (ii) it is acceptable to Sujatha? Solution : One shirt is drawn at random from the carton of 100 shirts. Therefore, there are 100 equally likely outcomes. (1) The number of outcomes favourable (i.e., acceptable) to Jimmy = 88 (Why?) we . 88 Therefore, P (shirt is acceptable to Jimmy) = 100 0.88 (ii) The number of outcomes favourable to Sujatha = 88 + 8=96 (Why?) Loe . 96 So, P (shirt is acceptable to Sujatha) = 100 > 0.96 Example 13 : Two dice, one blue and one grey, are thrown at the same time. Write down all the possible outcomes. What is the probability that the sum of the two numbers appearing on the top of the dice is (i) 8? (ii) 13? (iii) less than or equal to 12? Solution : When the blue die shows 1 , the grey die could show any one of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The same is true when the blue die shows 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 or 6 . The possible outcomes of the experiment are listed in the table below; the first number
