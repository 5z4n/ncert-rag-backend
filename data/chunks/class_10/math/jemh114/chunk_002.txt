red ball, a blue ball and a yellow ball, all the balls being of the same size. Kritika takes out a ball from the bag without looking into it. What is the probability that she takes out the (1) yellow ball? (ii) red ball? (iti) blue ball? Solution : Kritika takes out a ball from the bag without looking into it. So, itis equally likely that she takes out any one of them. Reprint 2025-26 PROBABILITY 205 Let Y be the event the ball taken out is yellow , B be the event the ball taken out is blue , and R be the event the ball taken out is red . Now, the number of possible outcomes = 3. (i) The number of outcomes favourable to the event Y = 1. So, P(Y) = and (iii) P(B) = Similarly, (ii) P(R) = 3 wWwlR wlRe Remarks : 1. An event having only one outcome of the experiment is called an elementary event. In Example 1, both the events E and F are elementary events. Similarly, in Example 2, all the three events, Y, B and R are elementary events. 2. In Example 1, we note that : P(E) + P(F) = 1 In Example 2, we note that : PCY) + P(R) + P(B) = 1 Observe that the sum of the probabilities of all the elementary events of an experiment is |. This is true in general also. Example 3 : Suppose we throw a die once. (1) What is the probability of getting a number greater than 4 ? (11) What is the probability of getting a number less than or equal to 4? Solution : (i) Here, let E be the event getting a number greater than 4 . The number of possible outcomes is six : 1, 2,3, 4,5 and 6, and the outcomes favourable to E are 5 and 6. Therefore, the number of outcomes favourable to E is 2. So, 2 P(E) = P(number greater than 4) = 63 (ii) Let F be the event getting a number less than or equal to 4 . Number of possible outcomes = 6 Outcomes favourable to the event F are 1, 2, 3, 4. So, the number of outcomes favourable to F is 4. Therefore, P(F) = 6 Reprint 2025-26 206 MATHEMATICS Are the events E and F in the example above elementary events? No, they are not because the event E has 2 outcomes and the event F has 4 outcomes. Remarks : From Example 1, we note that 1 1 P(E) + P(F) = 5st! (1) where E is the event getting a head and F is the event getting a tail . From (1) and (11) of Example 3, we also get 1 2 P(E) + P(F) = 3137! (2) where E is the event getting a number >4 and F is the event getting a number < 4 . Note that getting a number not greater than 4 is same as
