the year. Now, Hamida s birthday can also be any day of 365 days in the year. We assume that these 365 outcomes are equally likely. (1) If Hamida s birthday is different from Savita s, the number of favourable outcomes for her birthday is 365 1 = 364 . . 4 . . 364 So, P (Hamida s birthday is different from Savita s birthday) = 365 (ii) P(Savita and Hamida have the same birthday) 1 P (both have different birthdays) _ 364 [Using P(E ) = 1 P(E)] Reprint 2025-26 PROBABILITY 209 Example 7 : There are 40 students in Class X of a school of whom 25 are girls and 15 are boys. The class teacher has to select one student as a class representative. She writes the name of each student on a separate card, the cards being identical. Then she puts cards in a bag and stirs them thoroughly. She then draws one card from the bag. What is the probability that the name written on the card is the name of (i) a girl? (ii) a boy? Solution : There are 40 students, and only one name card has to be chosen. (i) The number of all possible outcomes is 40 The number of outcomes favourable for a card with the name of a girl = 25 (Why?) 25 5 Therefore, P (card with name of a girl) = P(Girl) = 40 = 8 (ii) The number of outcomes favourable for a card with the name of a boy = 15 (Why?) Therefore, P(card with name of a boy) = P(Boy) = 40 = 8 Note : We can also determine P(Boy), by taking 5 3 P(Boy) = 1 P(mot Boy) = 1 P(Girl) = 1 - 278 Example 8 : A box contains 3 blue, 2 white, and 4 red marbles. If a marble is drawn at random from the box, what 1s the probability that it will be (i) white? (ii) blue? (iii) red? Solution : Saying that a marble is drawn at random is a short way of saying that all the marbles are equally likely to be drawn. Therefore, the number of possible outcomes = 3 +2 +4=9 (Why?) Let W denote the event the marble is white , B denote the event the marble is blue and R denote the event marble is red . (i) The number of outcomes favourable to the event W = 2 So, P(W) = Similarly, (ii) P(B) = OlW Oly -1 na Gay prey 4 =3 an (iii) P(R)= 9 Note that P(W) + P(B) + P(R) = 1.

Solution : We write H for head and T for tail . When two coins are tossed simultaneously, the possible outcomes are (H, H), (H, T), (T, H), (T, T),
