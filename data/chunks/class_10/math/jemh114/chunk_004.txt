event. Note : From the definition of the probability P(E), we see that the numerator (number of outcomes favourable to the event E) is always less than or equal to the denominator (the number of all possible outcomes). Therefore, 0< P(E) <1 Now, let us take an example related to playing cards. Have you seen a deck of playing cards? It consists of 52 cards which are divided into 4 suits of 13 cards each spades (#), hearts ( ), diamonds (#) and clubs (#). Clubs and spades are of black colour, while hearts and diamonds are of red colour. The cards in each suit are ace, king, queen, jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6,5, 4, 3 and 2. Kings, queens and jacks are called face cards. Example 4 : One card is drawn from a well-shuffled deck of 52 cards. Calculate the probability that the card will (1) be an ace, (ii) not be an ace. Solution : Well-shuffling ensures equally likely outcomes. (i) There are 4 aces in a deck. Let E be the event the card is an ace . The number of outcomes favourable to E = 4 The number of possible outcomes = 52. (Why ?) 4 1 Therefore, P(E) = 52 = B (ii) Let F be the event card drawn is not an ace . The number of outcomes favourable to the event F = 52 -4=48 (Why?) Reprint 2025-26 208 MATHEMATICS The number of possible outcomes = 52 48 12 Therefore, P(F) = 32 = B Remark : Note that F is nothing but E. Therefore, we can also calculate P(F) as 1 12 . -pR)= ~j[- = < follows: P(F) = P(E ) = 1 P(E) BL Example 5 : Two players, Sangeeta and Reshma, play a tennis match. It is known that the probability of Sangeeta winning the match is 0.62. What is the probability of Reshma winning the match? Solution : Let S and R denote the events that Sangeeta wins the match and Reshma wins the match, respectively. The probability of Sangeeta s winning = P(S) = 0.62 (given) The probability of Reshma s winning = P(R) = 1 P(S) [As the events R and S are complementary] = 1 -0.62 = 0.38 Example 6 : Savita and Hamida are friends. What is the probability that both will have (1) different birthdays? (ii) the same birthday? (ignoring a leap year). Solution : Out of the two friends, one girl, say, Savita s birthday can be any day of the year. Now, Hamida s birthday can also be any day of 365 days in the year. We assume that these 365 outcomes are equally likely. (1) If Hamida s birthday is different from Savita s, the number of favourable outcomes for her birthday is 365 1 = 364 . . 4 . . 364 So, P (Hamida s birthday is different from Savita s birthday) = 365 (ii) P(Savita and Hamida have the same birthday) 1 P (both have
