EXERCISE 11.1 Unless stated otherwise, use 7 = Fz: 1. Find the area of a sector of a circle with radius 6 cm if angle of the sector is 60 . 2. Find the area of a quadrant of a circle whose circumference is 22 cm. 3. The length of the minute hand of a clock is 14 cm. Find the area swept by the minute hand in 5 minutes. 4. Achord ofa circle of radius 10 cm subtends a right angle at the centre. Find the area of the corresponding: (1) minorsegment (ii) major sector. (Use 7= 3.14) 5. Inacircle of radius 21 cm, an arc subtends an angle of 60 at the centre. Find: (1) the length ofthe arc (ii) area of the sector formed by the arc (iii) area of the segment formed by the corresponding chord 6. A chord of a circle of radius 15 cm subtends an angle of 60 at the centre. Find the areas of the corresponding minor and major segments of the circle. (Use m= 3.14 and ./3 =1.73) 7. A chord of a circle of radius 12 cm subtends an angle of 120 at the centre. Find the area of the corresponding segment of the circle. (Use m= 3.14 and ./3 =1.73) 8. A horse is tied to a peg at one corner of a square shaped grass field of side 15 m by means of a 5 m long rope (see Fig. 11.8). Find Reprint 2025-26 AREAS RELATED TO CIRCLES (i) the area of that part of the field in which the horse can graze. (ii) the increase in the grazing area if the rope were 10 m long instead of 5 m. (Use m= 3.14) 9. A brooch is made with silver wire in the form of a circle with diameter 35 mm. The wire is also used in making 5 diameters which divide the circle into 10 equal sectors as shown in Fig. 11.9. Find: (1) the total length of the silver wire required. (1i) the area
