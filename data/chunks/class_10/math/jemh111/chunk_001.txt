relation (or formula) for area of a sector of a circle: Area of the sector of angle 0 = xm, 360 where r is the radius of the circle and 0 the angle of the sector in degrees. Now, a natural question arises : Can we find the length of the are APB corresponding to this sector? Yes. Again, by applying the Unitary Method and taking the whole length of the circle (of angle 360 ) as 2mr, we can obtain the required length of th APB as ~*27r. eng oO e are as 360 = x2 So, length of an arc of a sector of angle 0 360 x 2m , Fig. 11.4 Reprint 2025-26 156 MATHEMATICS Now let us take the case of the area of the segment APB of a circle with centre O and radius r (see Fig. 11.4). You can see that : Area of the segment APB = Area of the sector OAPB Area of A OAB = oy mr area of AOAB Note : From Fig. 11.3 and Fig. 11.4 respectively, you can observe that: Area of the major sector OAQB = mr Area of the minor sector OAPB and Area of major segment AQB = m7 Area of the minor segment APB Let us now take some examples to understand these concepts (or results). Example 1 : Find the area of the sector of a circle with radius 4 cm and of angle 30 . Also, find the area of the corresponding major sector (Use 1 = 3.14). Solution : Given sector is OAPB (see Fig. 11.5). 6 > = xXT Area of the sector 360 r = 30 34x 4x dem? 12.56 = a cm? =4.19cm? (approx.)

(Use mt = 7) Solution : Area of the segment AYB = Area of sector OAYB Area of A OAB Now, area of the sector OAYB = ae x = x 21x 21 cm? = 462 cm?
