Reprint 2025-26 F Glossary ramparts: the high, wide walls around a castle or fort, for example, the ramparts of the Red Fort Thinking about the Poem 4 1. What does the young man mean by great honey-coloured /Ramparts at your ear? Why does he say that young men are thrown into despair by them? What colour is the young woman s hair? What does she say she can change it to? Why would she want to do so? Objects have qualities which make them desirable to others. Can you think of some objects (a car, a phone, a dress...) and say what qualities make one object more desirable than another? Imagine you were trying to sell an object: what qualities would you emphasise? What about people? Do we love others because we like their qualities, whether physical or mental? Or is it possible to love someone for themselves alone ? Are some people more lovable than others? Discuss this question in pairs or in groups, considering points like the following. (i) a parent or caregiver s love for a newborn baby, for a mentally or physically challenged child, for a clever child or a prodigy (ii) the public s love for a film star, a sportsperson, a politician, or a social worker (iii) your love for a friend, or brother or sister (iv) your love for a pet, and the pet s love for you. You have perhaps concluded that people are not objects to be valued for their qualities or riches rather than for themselves. But elsewhere Yeats asks the question: How can we separate the dancer from the dance? Is it possible to separate the person himself or herself from how the person looks, sounds, walks, and so on? Think of how you or a friend or member of your family has changed over the years. Has your relationship also changed? In what way? Reprint 2025-26 =) a = ico} e
