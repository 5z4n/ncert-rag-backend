research on these questions and report their findings in class. Ask students if they know of other examples of unusual pets or of wild animals which are trained to work for or amuse humans (eg dancing bears, lions and tigers in a circus, elephants trained to work or take part in ceremonies). Then lead students into a discussion about the ethics of keeping wild animals as pets: What are the difficulties these may entail? According to the students, what will the animal miss most when it is taken away from its natural habitat? Do they think that it is cute to see Mij the otter on a leash? Get them to look at the situation from all points of view. Visit the website wwf.org.uk/core/wildlife to know more about otters and otter conservation projects.
