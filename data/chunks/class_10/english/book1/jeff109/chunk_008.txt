[Hysterics.] What s that? What s the matter with you? [Clutches at his head] Oh, unhappy man that I am! I'll shoot myself! I'll hang myself! We ve done for her! I'm dying! Fetch him! Tfoo! At once. Don t yell! [Runs out. A pause.] [Natalya Stepanovna wails.] What have they done to me? Fetch him back! Fetch him! [A pause. Chubukov runs in.] He s coming, and so on, devil take him! Ouf! Talk to him yourself; I don t want to... [wails] Fetch him! [yells] He s coming, I tell you. Oh, what a burden, Lord, to be the father of a grown-up daughter! I'll cut my throat I will, indeed! We cursed him, abused him, drove him out; and it s all you... you! No, it was you! I tell you it s not my fault. [Lomov appears at the door] Now you talk to him yourself. [Exit.] [Lomov enters, exhausted.] My heart s palpitating awfully. My foot s gone to sleep. There s something that keeps pulling in my side.... Forgive us, Ivan Vassilevitch, we were all a little heated. I remember now: Oxen Meadows... really are yours. My heart s beating awfully. My Meadows... My eyebrows are both twitching.... : The Meadows are yours, yes, yours. Do sit down. [They sit] We were wrong. I did it on principle. My land is worth little to me, but the principle... : Yes, the principle, just so. Now let s talk of something else. : The more so as I have evidence. My aunt s grandmother gave the land to your father s grandfather s peasants... : Yes, yes, let that pass. [aside] I wish I knew how to get him started. [aloud] Are you going to start shooting soon?

Oh, have you heard? Just think, what a misfortune I ve had! My dog Guess, who you know, has gone lame. : What a pity! Why? I don t know. Must have got his leg twisted or bitten by some other dog. /sighs] My very best dog, to say nothing of the expense. I gave Mironov 125 roubles for him. It was too much, Ivan Vassilevitch. I think it was very cheap. He s a first-rate dog. Papa gave 85 roubles for his Squeezer, and Squeezer is heaps better than Guess! Squeezer better than Guess? What an idea! [/Jaughs] Squeezer better than Guess! Of course he s better! Of course, Squeezer is young, he may develop a bit, but on points and pedigree he s better than anything that even Volchanetsky has got. Excuse me, Natalya
