can say 125 is the third power of 5. lo2 | IORASED TO THE Power 2 What is the exponent and the base in 53? Similarly, 2 =2x2x2x2x2= 32, whichis the fifth power of 2. In 2 , 2 is the base and 5 is the exponent. In the same way, 243 =3x3x3x3x3=3 64=2x2x2x2x2x2=2 625=5x5x5x5=5' Find five more such examples, where a number is expressed in exponential form. Also identify the base and the exponent in each case. You can also extend this way of writing when the base is a negative integer. What does ( 2) mean? Itis ( 2) = (-2) x (-2) x (-2) =-8 Is (-2)*= 16? Checkit. Instead of taking a fixed number let us take any integer a as the base, and write the numbers as, aX a=a? (read as a squared or a raised to the power 2 ) axaxaz=a@ (read as acubed or a raised to the power 3 ) axaxaxa=a'(read as a raised to the power 4 or the 4" power of a) axaxaxaxaxaxa=da' (read as a raised to the power 7 or the 7" power of a) and so on. axaxaxbxb canbe expressed as a*b (read as a cubed b squared) 2024-25 MATHEMATICS axaxbxbxbx bcan be expressed as a b* (read as a squared into b raised to the power of 4). Express: (i) 729 as a power of 3_= EXAMPLE I Express 256 as a power 2. @ 128.8. power of 2 SV My SOLUTION We have 256 =2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2. (ii) 343 asapowerof7 <2 So we can say that 256 = 2 EXAMPLE 2 Which one is greater 2? or 37? SOLUTION Wehave,2?=2x2x2=8 and 3? =3x3=9. Since 9 > 8, so, 3 is greater than 2 EXAMPLE 3 Which one is greater 87 or 2 ? SOLUTION 8 =8x8=64 22 =2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2 = 256 Clearly, 2 > 8 EXAMPLE 4Expand ab , a*b , b a , b a . Are they all same? SOLUTION a? =axb (axaxa)x(bxb) axaxaxbxb Ch=axb =axaxbxbxb b? 3- bh x@ =bxbxaxaxa bae=abhxa =bxbxbxaxa Note that in the case of terms a? b and a b* the powers of a and b are different. Thus a b and a b are different. On the other hand, a? b? and b a are the same, since the powers of a and b in these two terms are the same. The order of factors does not matter. Thus, 8b? =a xb? =b x a =D a . Similarly, a? b? and b? a are the same. EXAMPLE 5 xpress the following numbers as a product of powers of prime factors: (i) 72 (i) 432 (ii) 1000 (tv) 16000 2/72 SOLUTION 2 | 36 (i) 72=2x36=2x2x18 >| 18 =2x2x2x9 3/9 =2x2x2x3x3=2?x3? Thus, 72 = 2? x 3? (required prime factor product form) 3 2024-25 EXPONENTS AND POWERS (i) 432=2x216=2x2x108=2x2x2x54 =2x2x2x2x27=2x2x2x2x3x9 =2x2x2x2x3x3x3 or 432 = 2* x 33 (required form) (i) 1000=2x500=2x2x250=2x2x2x 125 =2x2x2x5x25=2x2x2x5x5xS5 or 1000 = 2? x 5? Atul wants to solve this example in another way: 1000 =
