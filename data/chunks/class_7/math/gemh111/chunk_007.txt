We said that large numbers can be conveniently expressed using exponents. We have not as yet shown this. We shall do so now. 1. Sunis located 300,000,000,000,000,000,000 m from the centre of our Milky Way Galaxy. 2. Number of stars in our Galaxy is 100,000,000,000. 3. Mass of the Earth is 5,976,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg. These numbers are not convenient to write and read. To make it convenient we use powers. RY LHESE Observe the following: Expand by exp ressing powers of 10 in the 59=5.9x 10=5.9 x 10! exponential form: 590 = 5.9 x 100 = 5.9 x 107 (i) 172 5900 = 5.9 x 1000 = 5.9 x 103 (i) 5,643 (iii) 56,439 _ _ 4 59000 =5.9 x 10000 = 5.9 x 10* and so on. (iv) 1,76,428 2024-25 EXPONENTS AND POWERS (i; oo We have expressed all these numbers in the standard form. Any number can be expressed as a decimal number between 1.0 and 10.0 including 1.0 multiplied by a power of 10. Such a form of a number is called its standard form. Thus, 5,985 = 5.985 x 1,000 = 5.985 x 10 is the standard form of 5,985. Note, 5,985 can also be expressed as 59.85 x 100 or 59.85 x 10 . But these are not the standard forms, of 5,985. Similarly, 5,985 = 0.5985 x 10,000 = 0.5985 x 10*is also not the standard form of 5,985. We are now ready to express the large numbers we came across at the beginning of the chapter in this form. The, distance of Sun from the centre of our Galaxy i.e., 300,000,000,000,000,000,000 m can be written as 3.0 x 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 = 3.0 x 107? m Now, can you express 40,000,000,000 in the similar way? Count the number of zeros in it. Itis 10. So, 40,000,000,000 = 4.0 x 10' Mass of the Earth = 5,976,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg = 5.976 x 10% kg Do you agree with the fact, that the number when written in the standard form is much easier to read, understand and compare than when the number is written with 25 digits? Now, Mass of Uranus = 86,800,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg = 8.68 x 10*> kg Simply by comparing the powers of 10 in the above two, you can tell that the mass of Uranus is greater than that of the Earth. The distance between Sun and Saturn is 1,433,500,000,000 m or 1.4335 x 10'?m. The distance betwen Saturn and Uranus is 1,439,000,000,000 m or 1.439 x 10'2m. The distance between Sun and
