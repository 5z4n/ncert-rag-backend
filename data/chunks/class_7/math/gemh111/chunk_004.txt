SOLUTION (5?) x3 means 5? is multiplied by 3 i.e., 5 x 5 x 3 =75 but (5 y means 5 is multiplied by itself three times i.e. , 5? x 5 x 57 = 5 = 15,625 Therefore (5 )? > (57) x 3 11.3.4 Multiplying Powers with the Same Exponents Can you simplify 2 x 3 ? Notice that here the two terms 2? and 3 have different bases, but the same exponents. Now, 2x 33=(2x2x2)x(3x3x 3) =(2x3)x (2x3) x (2x 3) =6x6x6 =6 (Observe 6 is the product of bases 2 and 3) Consider 4* x 3* =(4x4x4x4)x(3x3x3 x3) = (4x 3)x (4x 3) x (4x 3) x (4x 3) =12x 12x 12 x12 = 12+ Consider, also, 3 x a =(3 x3) x (axa) Put into another form using a x b = (ab)": =(3 x a)x (3 xa) i) 4x23 (ii) 25x b> = (3 x a) = (3a)?
