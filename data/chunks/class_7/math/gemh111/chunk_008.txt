and compare than when the number is written with 25 digits? Now, Mass of Uranus = 86,800,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg = 8.68 x 10*> kg Simply by comparing the powers of 10 in the above two, you can tell that the mass of Uranus is greater than that of the Earth. The distance between Sun and Saturn is 1,433,500,000,000 m or 1.4335 x 10'?m. The distance betwen Saturn and Uranus is 1,439,000,000,000 m or 1.439 x 10'2m. The distance between Sun and Earth is 149, 600,000,000 m or 1.496 x 10!!m. Can you tell which of the three distances is smallest? EXAMPLE 13 xpress the following numbers in the standard form: | ll ANA i D i | (i) 5985.3 Gi) 65,950 Si (i) 3,430,000 (tv) 70,040,000,000 \" SOLUTION (i) 5985.3 = 5.9853 x 1000 = 5.9853 x 10% , (ii) 65,950 = 6.595 x 10,000 = 6.595 x 10* (ii) 3,430,000 = 3.43 x 1,000,000 = 3.43 x 10 (iv) 70,040,000,000 = 7.004 x 10,000,000,000 = 7.004 x 10! 2024-25 EE i emarics A point to remember is that one less than the digit count (number of digits) to the left of the decimal point in a given number is the exponent of 10 in the standard form. Thus, in 70,040,000,000 there is no decimal point shown; we assume it to be at the (right) end. From there, the count of the places (digits) to the left is 11. The exponent of 10 in the standard form is 11 1 = 10. In 5985.3 there are 4 digits to the left of the decimal point and hence the exponent of 10 in the standard form is 4 1 =3. EXERCISE 11.3 1. Write the following numbers in the expanded forms: 279404, 3006194, 2806196, 120719, 20068 2. Find the number from each of the following expanded forms: (a) 8 x10*+ 6 x10 + 0x10? + 4x10! + 5x10 (b) 4 x10 + 5x10 + 3x10? + 2x10 (c) 3 x10*+ 7x10? + 5x10 (d) 9 x10 + 2x10? + 3x10! 3. Express the following numbers in standard form: (i) 5,00,00,000 (ii) 70,00,000 (iii) 3,18,65,00,000 (iv) 3,90,878 (v) 39087.8 (vi) 3908.78 4. Express the number appearing in the following statements in standard form. (a) The distance between Earth and Moon is 384,000,000 m. (b) Speed of light in vacuum is 300,000,000 m/s. (c) Diameter of the Earth is 1,27,56,000 m. (d) Diameter of the Sun is 1,400,000,000 m. (e) Ina galaxy there are on an average 100,000,000,000 stars. (f) The universe is estimated to be about 12,000,000,000 years old. (g) The distance of the Sun from the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy is estimated to be 300,000,000,000,000,000,000 m. (h) 60,230,000,000,000,000,000,000 molecules are contained in a drop of water weighing 1.8 gm. (i) The earth has 1,353,000,000 cubic km of sea water. (j) The population of India was about 1,027,000,000 in March, 2001. 2024-25 EXPONENTS AND POWERS (iii oo WHAT HAVE WE DISCUSSED? 1. Very large numbers are difficult to read, understand, compare
