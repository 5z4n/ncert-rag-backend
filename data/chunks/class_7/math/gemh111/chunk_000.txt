Mass of Uranus is 86,800,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg. Which has greater mass, Earth or Uranus? Distance between Sun and Saturn is 1,433,500,000,000 m and distance between Saturn and Uranus is 1,439,000,000,000 m. Can you read these numbers? Which distance is less? These very large numbers are difficult to read, understand and compare. To make these numbers easy to read, understand and compare, we use exponents. In this Chapter, we shall learn about exponents and also learn how to use them. We can write large numbers in a shorter form using exponents. Observe 10, 000 = 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 = 10 The short notation 10* stands for the product 10x10x10x10. Here 10 is called the base and 4 the exponent. The number 10 is read as 10 raised to the power of 4 or simply as fourth power of 10. 104 is called the exponential form of 10,000. We can similarly express 1,000 as a power of 10. Note that 1000 = 10 x 10 x 10 = 10 Here again, 10 is the exponential form of 1,000. Similarly, 1,00,000 = 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 = 10 10 is the exponential form of 1,00,000 In both these examples, the base is 10; in case of 10 , the exponent is 3 and incase of 10 the exponent is 5. 2024-25 EXPONENTS AND POWERS We have used numbers like 10, 100, 1000 etc., while writing numbers in an expanded form. For example, 47561 = 4 x 10000 + 7 x 1000 +5 x 100+ 6x 10+ 1 This can be written as 4 x 104+ 7 x10 +5 x 10?+6x 10+1. Try writing these numbers in the same way 172, 5642, 6374. In all the above given examples, we have seen numbers whose base is 10. However the base can be any other number also. For example: 81=3x3x3x3can be written as 81 = 3*, here 3 is the base and 4 is the exponent. Some powers have special names. For example, 10 , which is 10 raised to the power 2, also read as 10 squared and 10 , which is 10 raised to the power 3, also read as 10 cubed . WAYS, Can you tell what 5 (5 cubed) means? ~= ~ 0 S3=5x5x5=125 So, we can say 125 is the third power of 5. lo2 | IORASED TO THE Power 2 What is the exponent and the base in 53? Similarly, 2 =2x2x2x2x2= 32, whichis the fifth power of 2. In 2 , 2 is the base and 5 is the exponent. In the same way, 243 =3x3x3x3x3=3 64=2x2x2x2x2x2=2 625=5x5x5x5=5' Find five more such examples, where a number is expressed in exponential form. Also identify the base and the exponent in each case.
