the following numbers as a product of powers of prime factors: (i) 72 (i) 432 (ii) 1000 (tv) 16000 2/72 SOLUTION 2 | 36 (i) 72=2x36=2x2x18 >| 18 =2x2x2x9 3/9 =2x2x2x3x3=2?x3? Thus, 72 = 2? x 3? (required prime factor product form) 3 2024-25 EXPONENTS AND POWERS (i) 432=2x216=2x2x108=2x2x2x54 =2x2x2x2x27=2x2x2x2x3x9 =2x2x2x2x3x3x3 or 432 = 2* x 33 (required form) (i) 1000=2x500=2x2x250=2x2x2x 125 =2x2x2x5x25=2x2x2x5x5xS5 or 1000 = 2? x 5? Atul wants to solve this example in another way: 1000 = 10 x 100 = 10 x 10x 10 = (2x5)x(2x5)x(2x5) (Sincel0 =2 x 5) =2x5x2x5x2x5=2x2x2x5x5x5 or 1000 = 23x 5? Is Atul s method correct? (iv) 16,000= 16x 1000 = (2x2x2x 2) x1000 = 2* x10 (as 16=2x 2x 2x2) =(2x2x2x2)x(2x2x2x5x5x5)=2'x2xS? (Since 1000 =2x2x2x5x5x5) =(2X2x2x2x2x2x2)x(5x5x5) or, 16,000 = 2 x 5?
