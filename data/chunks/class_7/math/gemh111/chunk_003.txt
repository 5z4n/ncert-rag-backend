=(2x2)x(2x2x 2) =2x2x2x2x2=2)=2% Note that the base in 2 and 2? is same and the sum of the exponents, i.e., 2 and 3 is 5 (ii) (-3)* x (-3) = [(-3) x (-3) x (-3)x (-3)]_ x [(-3) x (-3) x -3)] = (3) x (-3) x (-3) x (3) x (-3) x (3) x (-3) = (-3) _ (-3)8 Again, note that the base is same and the sum of exponents, 1.e., 4 and 3, is 7 (iii) a ? xat=(axa)x(axaxa xa) =axaxaxaxaxa= a (Note: the base is the same and the sum of the exponents is 2 + 4=6) Similarly, verify: 42 x 42 = 42+2 32% 33 = 3243 2024-25 EXPONENTS AND POWERS Can you write the appropriate number in the box. Try THESE (HyxCeips= Cid Simplify and write in b? x b =bU (Remember, base is same; b is any integer). exponential form: cx ct =cU (cis any integer) @) 2 x 2? d x d= qu (ii) p? x p* ii) 43 x 42 From this we can generalise that for any non-zero integer a, where m (iv) @xaxa and n are whole numbers, . (vy) 53x 5 x 5 a "xa =a"*" (vi) ( 4)!2 x ( 4)? Caution! Consider 2? x 3? Can you add the exponents? No! Do you see why ? The base of 23 is 2 and base of 3 is 3. The bases are not same. 11.3.2 Dividing Powers with the Same Base Let us simplify 3 +3*? 3 _ 3X3x3xX3x3x3x3 Se ME Be 3X3 K3x3 =3x3x3=3%=37"4 Thus 37 + 34= 37-4 (Note, in 3 and 3* the base is same and 3 + 34 becomes 37 ) Similarly, 56 =. Sym 5 _ 5x5x5x5x5x5 5 5x5 =5x5x5x5=54=5 ? or 56 +57 =5 -? Let a be a non-zero integer, then, a axaxaxa d+a=5 =axa=a =a a axa or ai+a=a ? Now can you answer quickly? 108 + 10 = 108-3= 10 P+27%=70 a+a=aul 2024-25 MATHEMATICS For non-zero integers b and c, eva b= p= pu Simplify and write in exponential (100 = PM = O form: (eg., 11 + 11?= 11 ) (i) 2?+2? q@ 10 = 10 Git) 9'' +97 Gv) 20% = 20% (vy) 78 +7' In general, for any non-zero integer a, a" ~q'=a"~-" where m and n are whole numbers and m >n. 11.3.3 Taking Power of a Power Consider the following Simplify (2 ) ; (3 ) Now, (2 y means 2 is multiplied two times with itself. (2) =23x 2 = 23*3 (Since a x a" =a"*") =- 26 = 23 x2 Thus (2 y = 23 Similarly (3 ) = 3? x 32x 32x 3? _ 32424242 = 3 (Observe 8 is the product of 2 and 4). = 32%4 Can you tell what would ( T y" would be equal to?
