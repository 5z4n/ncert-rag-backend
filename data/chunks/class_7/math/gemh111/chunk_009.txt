(h) 60,230,000,000,000,000,000,000 molecules are contained in a drop of water weighing 1.8 gm. (i) The earth has 1,353,000,000 cubic km of sea water. (j) The population of India was about 1,027,000,000 in March, 2001. 2024-25 EXPONENTS AND POWERS (iii oo WHAT HAVE WE DISCUSSED? 1. Very large numbers are difficult to read, understand, compare and operate upon. To make all these easier, we use exponents, converting many of the large numbers in a shorter form. 2. The following are exponential forms of some numbers? 10,000 = 10? (read as 10 raised to 4) 243 = 3 , 128 = 27. Here, 10, 3 and 2 are the bases, whereas 4, 5 and 7 are their respective exponents. We also say, 10,000 is the 4" power of 10, 243 is the 5 power of 3, etc. 3. Numbers in exponential form obey certain laws, which are: For any non-zero integers a and b and whole numbers mand n, (a) a xa"=a *" (b) a"+a"=a""", m>n (c) (a"y"=a" (d) a" x b" = (ab)" (e) a"=b"= (<) () a= (g) (-l)" number 1 ( 1) *4 number __ 1 2024-25
