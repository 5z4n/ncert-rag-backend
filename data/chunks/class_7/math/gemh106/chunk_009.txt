V 4+5 47 etc. This shows that Pythagoras property holds if and only if the triangle is right-angled. Hence we get this fact: If the Pythagoras property holds, the triangle must be right-angled. EXAMPLE 5Determine whether the triangle whose lengths of sides are 3 cm, 4 cm, 5 cmis aright-angled triangle. SOLUTION 3?=3x3=9;4=4x4=16;5 7=5x5=25 We find 3? + 47 = 5 . Therefore, the triangle is right-angled. Note: In any right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse happens to be the longest side. In this example, the side with length 5 cm is the hypotenuse. EXAMPLE 6 A ABC is right-angled at C. If a AC =5 cm and BC = 12 cm find 5 cm ? the length of AB. . . C B SoLuTion Arough figure will help us (Fig 6.28). 12cm By Pythagoras property, Fig 6.28 AB? = AC? + BC? = 5? 412? = 25+ 144 = 169 = 13? or AB = 137. So, AB = 13 or the length of AB is 13 cm.
