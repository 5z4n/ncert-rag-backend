A, he or she will not take the route BC and CA but will prefer BA This is because BC+CA> AB (it) By asimilar argument, you find that CA+AB > BC (iti) These observations suggest that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the third side. Collect fifteen small sticks (or strips) of different lengths, say, 6 cm, 7 cm, 8 cm, 9cm,..., 20cm. Take any three of these sticks and try to form a triangle. Repeat this by choosing different combinations of three sticks. Suppose you first choose two sticks of length 6 cm and 12 cm. Your third stick has to be of length more than 12 6=6 cm and less than 12 +6= 18 cm. Try this and find out why it is so. To form a triangle you will need any three sticks such that the sum of the lengths of any two of them will always be greater than the length of the third stick. This also suggests that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the third side. 2024-25 EE emarics 3. Draw any three triangles, say AABC, APQR and AXYZ in your notebook (Fig 6.22). A \ Z aN > Q x a Y @ i (ait) Fig 6.22 Use your ruler to find the lengths of their sides and then tabulate your results as follows: renee of Sides Is this True? SC AB-BC<CA (Yes/No) i ae | BC CA < AB (Yes/No) + > CA- AB<BC (Yes/No) + > PQ QR<RP (Yes/No) + > QR- RP<PQ (Yes/No) + > RP PQ<QR (Yes/No) + > XY-YZ<ZX (Yes/No) + > YZ-ZX<XY (Yes/No) + > ZX -XY<YZ (Yes/No) + > This also strengthens our earlier guess. Therefore, we conclude that sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the third side. We also find that the difference between the length of any two sides of a triangle is smaller than the length of the third side. 2024-25 THE TRIANGLE AND ITS PROPERTIES ER iii iit EXAMPLE 3Js there a triangle whose sides have lengths 10.2 cm, 5.8 cm and 4.5 cm? SOLUTION Suppose such atriangle is possible. Then the sum of the lengths of any two sides would be greater than the length of the third side. Let us check this. Is 4.5 + 5.8 >10.2? Yes Is 5.8 + 10.2 > 4.5? Yes Is 10.2 + 4.5 > 5.8? Yes Therefore, the triangle is possible. EXAMPLE 4 The lengths of two sides of a triangle are 6 cm and 8 cm. Between which two numbers can length of the third side fall? SOLUTION We know that the sum of two sides of a triangle is always greater than the third. Therefore, third side has to be less than the sum of the two sides. The third side is thus, less than 8+ 6= 14cm. The side cannot be less
