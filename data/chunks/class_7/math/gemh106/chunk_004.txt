gives 180 (or nearly 180 ). When perfect precision is possible, this will also show that the sum of the measures of the three angles of a triangle is 180 . You are now ready to give a formal justification of your assertion through logical argument. Statement The total measure of s the three angles of a triangle is 180 . 4 To justify this let us use the exterior B angle property of a triangle. . C D Fig 6.17 2024-25 EE Ss i eMatics Given Z1, 22, Z3 are angles of AABC (Fig 6.17). Z4 is the exterior angle when BC is extended to D. Justification 21+ 22 = 4 (by exterior angle property) Z14+ 22+ 23= 24+ 23 (adding Z3 to both the sides) But 24 and 23 form a linear pair so it is 180 . Therefore, 71 + 72 + 23 = 180 . Let us see how we can use this property in a number of ways. EXAMPLE 2 In the given figure (Fig 6.18) find mZP. P SoLution By angle sum property of a triangle, mZP + 47 + 52 = 180 Therefore mZP = 180 47 -52 QQ) AR ~ 180 99 = 81 Fig 6.18 EXERCISE 6.3 1.

Take two copies of an equilateral triangle ABC (Fig 6.19). Keep one of them fixed. Place the second triangle on it. It fits exactly into the first. Turn it round in any way and still they fit with one another exactly. Are you able to see that when the three sides of a triangle have equal lengths
