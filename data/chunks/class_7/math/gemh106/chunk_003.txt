an obtuse angle? (ii) anacute angle? 2. Can the exterior angle of a triangle be a straight angle? Try THESE 1. Anexterior angle of a triangle is of measure 70 and one of its interior opposite angles is of measure 25 . Find the measure of the other interior opposite angle. 2. The two interior opposite angles of an exterior angle of a triangle are 60 and 80 . Find the measure of the exterior angle. 3. Is something wrong in this diagram (Fig 6.12)? Comment. EXERCISE 6.2 1. Find the value of the unknown exterior angle x in the following diagrams: 2024-25 EE a i emarics 2. Find the value of the unknown interior angle x in the following figures: ? (iii) AW (vi) 7 6.5 ANGLE SuM PROPERTY OF A TRIANGLE There is aremarkable property connecting the three angles of a triangle. You are going to see this through the following four activities. 1. Draw atriangle. Cut on the three angles. Rearrange them as shown in Fig 6.13 (1), (ii). The three angles now constitute one angle. This angle is a straight angle and so has measure 180 . @ (ii) Fig 6.13 Thus, the sum of the measures of the three angles of a triangle is 180 . 2. The same fact you can observe in a different way also. Take three copies of any triangle, say AABC (Fig 6.14). Fig 6.14 2024-25 THE TRIANGLE AND ITS PROPERTIES Iii Arrange them as in Fig 6.15. What do you observe about 71 + 22 + 23? (Do you also see the exterior angle ty ? property"?) Fig 6.15 3. Take apiece of paper and cut out a triangle, say, AABC (Fig 6.16). Make the altitude AM by folding AABC such that it passes through A. Fold now the three corners such that all the three vertices A, B and C touch at M. Fig 6.16 You find that all the three angles form together a straight angle. This again shows that the sum of the measures of the three angles of a triangle is 180 . 4. Draw any three triangles, say AABC, APQR and AX YZ in your notebook. Use your protractor and measure each of the angles of these triangles. Tabulate your results Name of A Measures of Angles Sum of the Measures of the three Angles AABC mZA = mZB= mZC= mZA+m/B+m/C= APQR mZP= mZQ= m/ZR= mZP+m4Q+mZR= AXYZ mZX= m/ZY= m/ZZ= mZX+mZY+mZZ= Allowing marginal errors in measurement, you will find that the last column always gives 180 (or nearly 180 ). When perfect precision is possible, this will also show that the sum of the measures of the three angles of a triangle is 180 . You are now ready to give a formal justification of your assertion through logical argument. Statement The total measure of s the three angles of a triangle is 180 . 4 To justify this let us use the exterior B angle property of a triangle. . C D Fig
