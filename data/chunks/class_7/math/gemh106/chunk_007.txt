Yes Therefore, the triangle is possible. EXAMPLE 4 The lengths of two sides of a triangle are 6 cm and 8 cm. Between which two numbers can length of the third side fall? SOLUTION We know that the sum of two sides of a triangle is always greater than the third. Therefore, third side has to be less than the sum of the two sides. The third side is thus, less than 8+ 6= 14cm. The side cannot be less than the difference of the two sides. Thus, the third side has to be more than 8 6=2 cm. The length of the third side could be any length greater than 2 and less than 14 cm. EXERCISE 6.4 1.

Between what two measures should the length of the third side fall? TuHink, Discuss AND WRITE in 1. Isthe sum of any two angles of a triangle always greater than the third angle? , Pythagoras, a Greek philosopher of sixth century === B.C. is said to have founda very important and useful property of right-angled triangles given in this section. A The property is, hence, named after him. In fact, this property was known to people of many other countries too. The Indian mathematician Baudhayan has also given an equivalent form of this property. B C We now try to explain the Pythagoras property. | vy we 6.8 RIGHT-ANGLED TRIANGLES AND PYTHAGORAS PROPERTY Fig 6.23 In aright-angled triangle, the sides have some special names. The side opposite to the right angle is called the hypotenuse; the other two sides are known as the legs of the right-angled triangle. In AABC (Fig 6.23), the right-angle is at B. So, AC is the hypotenuse. AB and BC are the legs of AABC. b a Make eight identical copies of right angled triangle of any size you prefer. For example, you make a right-angled triangle whose hypotenuse is a Cc units long and the legs are of lengths b units and c units (Fig 6.24). Fig 6.24 Draw two identical squares on a sheet with sides of lengths b +c. You are to place four triangles in one square and the remaining four triangles in the other square, as shown in the following diagram (Fig 6.25). c b c b Square A Fig 6.25 Square B 2024-25 THE TRIANGLE AND ITS PROPERTIES
