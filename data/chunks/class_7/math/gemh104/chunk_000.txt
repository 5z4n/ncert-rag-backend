0756CHO4 The teacher has said that she would be starting anew chapter in Rea oo. mathematics and it is going to be simple equations. Appu, Sarita and Ameena have revised what they learnt in algebra chapter in 77/ ch we AES i na\al Class VI. Have you? Appu, Sarita and Ameena are excited because they have constructed a game which they call mind reader and they want to present it to the whole class. The teacher appreciates their enthusiasm and invites them to present their game. Ameena begins; she asks Sara to think of a number, multiply it by 4 and add 5 to the product. Then, she asks Sara to tell the result. She says it is 65. Ameena instantly declares that the number Sara had thought of is 15. Sara nods. The whole class including Sara is surprised. Itis Appu s turn now. He asks Balu to think of anumber, multiply it by 10 and subtract 20 from the product. He then asks Balu what his result is? Balu says it is 50. Appu immediately tells the number thought by Balu. Itis 7, Balu confirms it. Everybody wants to know how the mind reader presented by Appu, Sarita and Ameena works. Can you see how it works? After studying this chapter and chapter 12, you will very well know how the game works. Let us take Ameena s example. Ameena asks Sara to think of anumber. Ameena does not know the number. For her, it could be anything 1, 2,3,..., 11,..., 100,.... Let us denote this unknown number by a letter, say x. You may use y or or some other letter in place of x. It does not matter which letter we use to denote the unknown number Sara has thought of. When Sara multiplies the number by 4, she gets 4.x. She then adds 5 to the product, which gives 4x + 5. The value of (4x + 5) depends on the value of x. Thus ifx=1,4x+5=4x1+45=9. This means that if Sara had | in her mind, her result would have been 9. Similarly, if she thought of 5, then for x =5,4*x+5=4x5+5=25; Thus if Sara had chosen 5, the result would have been 25. 2024-25 Chapter 4 EE es sr emarics To find the number thought by Sara let us work backward from her answer 65. We have to find x such that 4x+5=65 (4.1) Solution to the equation will give us the number which Sara held in her mind. Let us similarly look at Appu s example. Let us call the number Balu chose as y. Appu asks Balu to multiply the number by 10 and subtract 20 from the product. That is, from y, Balu first gets 10y and from there (10y 20). The result is known to be 50. Therefore, 10y 20 = 50 (4.2) The solution of this equation will give us the number Balu had thought of. 4.3 ReEvIEwW oF wHat WE Know Note, (4.1) and (4.2) are equations.
