+ 12 becomes 12) 5x+12-12=27-12 5x = 27-12 or 5x=15 or 5x=15 We shall now solve two more equations. As you can see they involve brackets, which have to be solved before proceeding. EXAMPLE 7 Solve (a) 4(m+3) =18 (b) 2(x+3)=8 SOLUTION (a) 4(m +3) =18 18 9 m+3= m+3= 4 2 or m= 3 3 (transposing 3 to RHS) m=2 ( ired solution) as. 3 9 6 _3 or TOA YT Ir 10n - -j=>-- -= 5 equired solutio 5 37575 3 3 3 Check LHS=4 53 =4x 5+ 4X3=2x3+4x3 [put m= 5] =6+12=18=RHS (b) 2(x+ 3) =8 We divide both sides by ( 2), so as to remove the brackets in the LHS, we get, x+3= 5 or x+3=-4 Le.,x= 4-3 (transposing 3 to RHS) or x=-7 (required solution) 2024-25 MATHEMATICS Check LHS = -2(-7+3)=~-2(-4) =8=RHS as required. 4.6 APPLICATIONS OF SIMPLE EQUATIONS TO PRACTICAL SITUATIONS We have already seen examples in which we have taken statements in everyday language and converted them into simple equations. We also have learnt how to solve simple equations. Thus we are ready to solve puzzles/problems from practical situations. The method is first to form equations corresponding to such situations and then to solve those equations to give the solution to the puzzles/problems. We begin with what we have already seen [Example | (i) and (iii), Section 4.2]. EXAMPLE 8Thesumof three times a number and 11 is 32. Find the number. SOLUTION @ Ifthe unknown number is taken to be x, then three times the number is 3x and the sum of 3x and 11 is 32. Thatis, 3x+ 11 =32 @ To solve this equation, we transpose 11 to RHS, so that 3x=32-11 or 3x=21 Thi 5 bined a . is equation was obtaine Now, divide botitgReapy 3 o earlier in Section 4.2, Example 1. So x= 3 = 7 The required number is 7. (We may check it by taking 3 times 7 and adding 11 to it. It gives 32 as required.) EXAMPLE 9Finda number, such that one-fourth of the number is 3 more than 7. SOLUTION Try THESE wv @ Letus take the unknown number to be y; one-fourth of yis > . (i) When you multiply 4 a number by 6 and y subtract 5 from the This number (+) is more than 7 by 3. product, you get 7. y Can you tell what Hence we get the equation for y as 47 7=3 the number is? (i) What is that num- @ To solve this equation, first transpose 7 to RHS We get =34+7=10. ber one third of We then multiply both sides of the equation by 4, to get which added to 5 gives 8? rn x4=10x4 or y=40 (the required number) 2024-25 SIMPLE EQUATIONS Let us check the equation formed. Putting the value of y in the equation, LHS = -7=10- 7=3=RHS, as required. EXAMPLE 10 Raju s father s age is 5 years more than three times Raju s age. Find Raju
