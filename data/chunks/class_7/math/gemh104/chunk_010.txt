equation, first transpose 7 to RHS We get =34+7=10. ber one third of We then multiply both sides of the equation by 4, to get which added to 5 gives 8? rn x4=10x4 or y=40 (the required number) 2024-25 SIMPLE EQUATIONS Let us check the equation formed. Putting the value of y in the equation, LHS = -7=10- 7=3=RHS, as required. EXAMPLE 10 Raju s father s age is 5 years more than three times Raju s age. Find Raju s age, if his father is 44 years old. SOLUTION @ As given in Example 3 earlier, the equation that gives Raju's age is 3y+5=44 @ Tosolve it, we first transpose 5, to get 3y = 44-5 =39 2. Dividing both sides by 3, we get y=13 That is, Raju s age is 13 years. (You may check the answer.) (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) 1. Setup equations and solve them to find the unknown numbers in the following cases: There are two types of boxes containing mangoes. Each box of the larger type contains = 4more mangoes than the number of mangoes contained in 8 boxes of the smaller type. Each larger box contains 100 mangoes. Find the number of mangoes contained in the smaller box? EXERCISE 4.3 Add 4 to eight times a number; you get 60. One-fifth of anumber minus 4 gives 3. If I take three-fourths of a number and add 3 to it, I get 21. When I subtracted 11 from twice a number, the result was 15. Munna subtracts thrice the number of notebooks he has from 50, he finds the result to be 8. Ibenhal thinks of a number. If she adds 19 to it and divides the sum by 5, she will get 8. Anwar thinks of a number. If he takes away 7 from 5 of the number, the result is 23.
