and RHS are equal). Thus if we add the same number to both sides of an equality, it still holds. Let us now subtract 2 from both the sides; as a result, LHS =8 -3-2=5-2=3 RHS =44+1-2=5-2=3. Again, the equality holds. Thus if we subtract the same number from both sides of an equality, it still holds. Similarly, if we multiply or divide both sides of the equality by the same non-zero number, it still holds. For example, let us multiply both the sides of the equality by 3, we get LHS =3 x (8-3)=3x5=15, RHS=3x(4+1)=3x5=15. The equality holds. Let us now divide both sides of the equality by 2. LHS = (8-3) +2=5+2=5 RHS = (441) +2=5+2= 5 = LHS Again, the equality holds. If we take any other equality, we shall find the same conclusions. Suppose, we do not observe these rules. Specificially, suppose we add different numbers, to the two sides of an equality. We shall find in this case that the equality does not 2024-25 SIMPLE EQUATIONS iit ie hold (i.e., its both sides are not equal). For example, let us take again equality (4.5), 8-3=4+4+1 add 2 to the LHS and 3 to the RHS. The new LHS is 8 3 +2 =5+2=7 and the new RHS is4+1+3=5+43=8. The equality does not hold, because the new LHS and RHS are not equal. Thus if we fail to do the same mathematical operation with same number on both sides of an equality, the equality may not hold. The equality that involves variables is an equation. These conclusions are also valid for equations, as in each equation variable represents a number only. Often an equation is said to be like a weighing balance. Doing a mathematical operation on an equation is like adding weights to or removing weights from the pans of a weighing balance. An equation is like a weighing balance with equal weights on both its pans, in which case the arm of the balance is exactly horizontal. If we add the same weights to both the pans, the arm remains horizontal. Similarly, if we remove the same weights from both the pans, the arm remains horizontal. On the other hand if we t t add different weights to the pans or remove different weights from | L.H.S. R.HLS. them, the balance is tilted; that is, the arm of the balance doesnot |A balanced equation is like a remain horizontal. weighing balance with equal weights in the two pans. We use this principle for solving an equation. Here, ofcourse, the balance is imaginary and numbers can be used as weights that can be physically balanced against each other. This is the real purpose in presenting the principle. Let us take some examples. @ Consider the equation: x+3=8 (4.6) We shall subtract 3 from both sides of this equation. The new LHS is x+3-3=xand thenewRHSis8-3=5 Why should we subtract 3, and not some other number? Try adding 3. Will it help? Why not? 3 It is
