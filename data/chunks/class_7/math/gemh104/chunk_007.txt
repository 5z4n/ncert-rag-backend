more than one mathematical operation. Let us solve some more equations with this in mind. EXAMPLE 5Solve: (a) 3n+7=25 (4.10) (b) 2p -1=23 (4.11) SOLUTION (a) We go stepwise to separate the variable n on the LHS of the equation. The LHS is 3n +7. We shall first subtract 7 from it so that we get 3n. From this, in the next step we shall divide by 3 to get n. Remember we must do the same operation on both sides of the equation. Therefore, subtracting 7 from both sides, 3n+7 -7=25-7 (Step 1) or 3n= 18 2024-25 (b) Let us put the solution p = 12 back into the equation. The solution is thus checked for its correctness. Why do you not check the solution of (a) also? SIMPLE EQUATIONS Now divide both sides by 3, 3n 18 Step 2 or n = 6, which is the solution. What should we do here? First we shall add 1 to both the sides: 2p-1+1=234+1 (Step 1) or 2p = 24 _ 2p _ 24 Now divide both sides by 2, we get > = > (Step 2) or p = 12, whichis the solution. One good practice you should develop is to check the solution you have obtained. Although we have not done this for (a) above, let us do it for this example. LHS =2p-1=2x12-1=24-1 = 23 =RHS We are now in a position to go back to the mind-reading game presented by Appu, Sarita, and Ameena and understand how they got their answers. For this purpose, let us look at the equations (4.1) and (4.2) which correspond respectively to Ameena s and Appu s examples. @ First consider the equation 4x+5=65. (4.1) Subtracting 5 from both sides, 4x+5 5=65- 5. Le. 4x = 60 Divide both sides by 4; this will separate x. We get = = or x = 15, whichis the solution. (Check, if it is correct.) @ Nowconsider,l0y 20= 50 (4.2) Adding 20 to both sides, we get 10y 20 + 20 =50+ 20 or 10y=70 Dividing both sides by 10, we get toy = 10 10 10 or y = 7, which is the solution. (Check if it is correct.) You will realise that exactly these were the answers given by Appu, Sarita and Ameena. They had learnt to set up equations and solve them. That is why they could construct their mind reader game and impress the whole class. We shall come back to this in Section 4.7. 2024-25 EE Se i eMarics EXERCISE 4.2 1.
