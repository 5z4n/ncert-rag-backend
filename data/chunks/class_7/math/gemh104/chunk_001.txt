Appu s example. Let us call the number Balu chose as y. Appu asks Balu to multiply the number by 10 and subtract 20 from the product. That is, from y, Balu first gets 10y and from there (10y 20). The result is known to be 50. Therefore, 10y 20 = 50 (4.2) The solution of this equation will give us the number Balu had thought of. 4.3 ReEvIEwW oF wHat WE Know Note, (4.1) and (4.2) are equations. Let us recall what we learnt about equations in Class VI. An equation is a condition on a variable. In equation (4.1), the variable is x; in equation (4.2), the variable is y. The word variable means something that can vary, i.e. change. A variable takes on different numerical values; its value is not fixed. Variables are denoted usually by letters of the alphabets, such as x, y, z, l, m, n, p, etc. From variables, we form expressions. The expressions are formed by performing operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on the variables. From x, we formed the expression (4x + 5). For this, first we multiplied x by 4 and then added 5 to the product. Similarly, from y, we formed the expression (10y 20). For this, we multiplied y by 10 and then subtracted 20 from the product. All these are examples of expressions. The value of an expression thus formed depends upon the chosen value of the variable. As we have already seen, when x = 1, 4x +5 =9; when x=5, 4x +5 = 25. Similarly, when x=15, 4x+5=4x15+5=65; when x=0, 4x+5=4x0+5=5; and so on. Equation (4.1) is a condition on the variable x. It states that the value of the expression (4x + 5) is 65. The condition is satisfied when x = 15. It is the solution to the equation 4x +5=65. When x =5, 4x + 5 = 25 and not 65. Thus x = 5 is not a solution to the equation. Similarly, x = 0 is not a solution to the equation. No value of x other than 15 satisfies the condition 4x + 5 =65. The value of the expression (10y 20) depends on the value of y. Verify this by giving five different values to y and finding for each y the value of (10 y 20). From the different values of (10y 20) you obtain, do you see a solution to 10y 20 = 50? If there is no solution, try giving more values to y and find whether the condition 10y 20 = 50 is met. 2024-25 SIMPLE EQUATIONS iit i 4.4 Wuat Equation 1s? In an equation there is always an equality sign. The equality sign shows that the value of the expression to the left of the sign (the left hand side or LHS) is equal to the value of the expression to the right of the sign (the right hand side or RHS). In equation (4.1), the LHS is (4x +5) and the
