Setup an equation in the following cases: (i) Irfan says that he has 7 marbles more than five times the marbles Parmit has. Irfan has 37 marbles. (Take m to be the number of Parmit s marbles.) (ii) Laxmi s father is 49 years old. He is 4 years older than three times Laxmi s age. (Take Laxmi s age to be y years.) (ii) The teacher tells the class that the highest marks obtained by a student in her class is twice the lowest marks plus 7. The highest score is 87. (Take the lowest score to be /.) (iv) Inan isosceles triangle, the vertex angle is twice either base angle. (Let the base angle be b in degrees. Remember that the sum of angles of a triangle is 180 degrees). 4.4.1 Solving an Equation Consider an equality 8-3=4+1 (4.5) | ll il) The equality (4.5) holds, since both its sides are equal (each is equal to 5). Let us now add 2 to both sides; as a result LHS =8-34+2=54+2=7 RHS =4+14+2=54+2=7. Again the equality holds (i.e., its LHS and RHS are equal). Thus if we add the same number to both sides of an equality, it still holds. Let us now subtract 2 from both the sides; as a result, LHS =8 -3-2=5-2=3 RHS =44+1-2=5-2=3. Again, the equality holds. Thus if we subtract the same number from both sides of an equality, it still holds. Similarly, if we multiply or divide both sides of the equality by the same non-zero number, it still holds. For example, let us
