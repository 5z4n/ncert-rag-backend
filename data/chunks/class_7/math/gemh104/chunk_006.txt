an equation. Here, ofcourse, the balance is imaginary and numbers can be used as weights that can be physically balanced against each other. This is the real purpose in presenting the principle. Let us take some examples. @ Consider the equation: x+3=8 (4.6) We shall subtract 3 from both sides of this equation. The new LHS is x+3-3=xand thenewRHSis8-3=5 Why should we subtract 3, and not some other number? Try adding 3. Will it help? Why not? 3 It is because subtracting 3 reduces the LHS to x. Since this does not disturb the balance, we have New LHS = New RHS or x=5 which is exactly what we want, the solution of the equation (4.6). 2024-25 EE emarics To confirm whether we are right, we shall put x = 5 in the original equation. We get LHS =x+3=5+3=8, which is equal to the RHS as required. By doing the right mathematical operation (i.e., subtracting 3) on both the sides of the equation, we arrived at the solution of the equation. @ Letus look at another equation x-3=10 (4.7) What should we do here? We should add 3 to both the sides, By doing so, we shall retain the balance and also the LHS will reduce to just x. New LHS = x-34+3=x , New RHS=10+3= 13 Therefore, x = 13, which is the required solution. By putting x= 13 in the original equation (4.7) we confirm that the solution is correct: LHS of original equation =x- 3 = 13-3=10 This is equal to the RHS as required. Similarly, let us look at the equations Sy = 35 (4.8) m > = 5 (4.9) | In the first case, we shall divide both the sides by 5. This will give us just yon LHS Sy _Sxy_ 35 5x7 New LHS = =U, New RHS = =~ = 7 Therefore, y=7 This is the required solution. We can substitute y = 7 in Eq. (4.8) and check that it is satisfied. In the second case, we shall multiply both sides by 2. This will give us just m on the LHS m The new LHS = 3 =m. The new RHS =5 x2 = 10. Hence, m= 10 (It is the required solution. You can check whether the solution is correct). One can see that in the above examples, the operation we need to perform depends on the equation. Our attempt should be to get the variable in the equation separated. Sometimes, for doing so we may have to carry out more than one mathematical operation. Let us solve some more equations with this in mind. EXAMPLE 5Solve: (a) 3n+7=25 (4.10) (b) 2p -1=23 (4.11) SOLUTION (a) We go stepwise to separate the variable n on the LHS of the equation. The LHS is 3n +7. We shall first subtract 7 from it so that we get 3n. From this, in the next step we shall divide by 3 to get n. Remember we must do the same operation on both
