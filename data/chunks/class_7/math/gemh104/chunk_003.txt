is z; z multiplied by 6 is 62. Subtracting 5 from 6z, one gets 6z 5. The result is 7. The equation is 6z 5 =7 2024-25 EE ee i emarics m (ii) One fourth of mis 7: It is greater than 7 by 3. This means the difference ( 7 7) is 3. The equation is m7 -7=3. ne : (iv) Take the number to be n. One third of 1 is 3 Li n This one-third plus 5 is 3 +5. Itis 8. n The equation is 3 +5=8. EXAMPLE 2 Convert the following equations in statement form: (i) x-5=9 (i) 5p =20 Gi) 3n+7=1 Ww = -2=6 SOLUTION (i) Taking away 5 fromx gives 9. (ii) Five times anumber p is 20. (ii) Add 7 to three times x to get 1. (iv) You get 6, when you subtract 2 from one-fifth of a number m. What is important to note is that for a given equation, not just one, but many statement forms can be given. For example, for Equation (i) above, you can say: Subtract 5 from x, you get 9. or Thenumber xis 5 more than 9. Write atleast one otherformfor or The number xis greater by 5 than 9. each equation (11), (iii)and (iv). or The difference between x and 5 is 9, and so on. EXAMPLE SConsider the following situation: Raju s father s age is 5 years more than three times Raju s age. Raju s father is 44 years old. Set up an equation to find Raju s age. SOLUTION We donot know Raju s age. Let us take it to be y years. Three times Raju s age is 3y years. Raju s father s age is 5 years more than 3y; that is, Raju s father is (3y + 5) years old. It is also given that Raju s father is 44 years old. Therefore, 3y+5=44 (4.3) This is an equation in y. It will give Raju s age when solved. EXAMPLE 4A shopkeeper sells mangoes in two types of boxes, one small and one large. A large box contains as many as 8 small boxes plus 4 loose mangoes. Set up an equation which gives the number of mangoes in each small box. The number of mangoes in a large box is given to be 100. SOLUTION Letasmall box contain m mangoes. A large box contains 4 more than 8 times m, that is, 8m +4 mangoes. But this is given to be 100. Thus 8m +4 = 100 (4.4) You can get the number of mangoes in a small box by solving this equation. 2024-25 SIMPLE EQUATIONS iit ie EXERCISE 4.1 1. Complete the last column of the table.
