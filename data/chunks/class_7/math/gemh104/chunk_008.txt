While solving these equations, we shall learn about transposing a number, 1.e., moving it from one side to the other. We can transpose a number instead of adding or subtracting it from both sides of the equation. EXAMPLE 6 Solve: 12p 5 =25 (4.12) SOLUTION Note, adding 5 to both sides ; ; ; is the same as changing side @ Adding 5 on both sides of the equation, of ( 5). 12p- 5+5=254+5 or 12p = 30 12p 5 = 25 12p =25+5 @ Dividing both sides by 12, Changing side is called 12p _ 30 2 2 PO transposing. While transposing anumber, we change its Sign. N|]n Check Putting p= 5 in the LHS of equation 4.12, LHS = 12x>-5 =6x5-5 = 30-5=25=RHS 2024-25 SIMPLE EQUATIONS iit oie As we have seen, while solving equations one commonly used operation is adding or subtracting the same number on both sides of the equation. Transposing a number (i.e., changing the side of the number) is the same as adding or subtracting the number from both sides. In doing so, the sign of the number has to be changed. What applies to numbers also applies to expressions. Let us take two more examples of transposing. Adding or Subtracting Transposing on both sides (i) 3p- 10=5 (i) 3p- 10=5 Add 10 to both sides Transpose ( 10) from LHS to RHS 3p -10+10=5+10 (On transposing 10 becomes + 10). or 3p=15 3p=5+10 or 3p=15 (i) 5x+12=27 (i) 5x+12=27 Subtract 12 from both sides Transposing + 12 (On transposing + 12 becomes 12) 5x+12-12=27-12 5x = 27-12 or 5x=15 or 5x=15 We shall now solve two more equations. As you can see they involve brackets, which have to be solved before proceeding. EXAMPLE 7 Solve (a) 4(m+3) =18 (b) 2(x+3)=8 SOLUTION (a) 4(m +3) =18 18 9 m+3= m+3= 4 2 or m= 3 3 (transposing 3 to RHS) m=2 ( ired solution) as. 3 9 6 _3 or TOA YT Ir 10n - -j=>-- -= 5 equired solutio
