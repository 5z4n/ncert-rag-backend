find whether the condition 10y 20 = 50 is met. 2024-25 SIMPLE EQUATIONS iit i 4.4 Wuat Equation 1s? In an equation there is always an equality sign. The equality sign shows that the value of the expression to the left of the sign (the left hand side or LHS) is equal to the value of the expression to the right of the sign (the right hand side or RHS). In equation (4.1), the LHS is (4x +5) and the RHS is 65. In equation (4.2), the LHS is (10y 20) and the RHS is 50. If there is some sign other than the equality sign between the LHS and the RHS, it is not an equation. Thus, 4x + 5 > 65 is not an equation. It says that, the value of (4x + 5) is greater than 65. Similarly, 4x +5 < 65 is not an equation. It says that the value of (4x + 5) is smaller than 65. In equations, we often find that the RHS is just a number. In Equation (4.1), it is 65 and in equation (4.2), itis 50. But this need not be always so. The RHS of an equation may be an expression containing the variable. For example, the equation 4x +5 = 6x - 25 has the expression (4x + 5) on the left and (6x 25) on the right of the equality sign. In short, an equation is a condition on a variable. The condition is that two expressions should have equal value. Note that at least one of the two expressions must contain the variable. We also note a simple and useful property of equations. The equation 4x +5 = 65 is the same as 65 = 4x + 5. Similarly, the equation 6x 25 = 4x +5 is the same as 4x + 5 =6x- 25. An equation remains the same, when the expressions on the left and on the right are interchanged. This property is often useful in solving equations. EXAMPLE 1 Write the following statements in the form of equations: (i) The sum of three times x and 11 is 32. (ii) Ifyou subtract 5 from 6 times a number, you get 7. (ii) One fourth of m is 3 more than 7. (iv) One third of a number plus 5 is 8. SOLUTION (i) Three times x is 3x. Sum of 3x and 11 is 3x + 11. The sum is 32. The equation is 3x + 11 =32. (it) Letus say the number is z; z multiplied by 6 is 62. Subtracting 5 from 6z, one gets 6z 5. The result is 7. The equation is 6z 5 =7 2024-25 EE ee i emarics m (ii) One fourth of mis 7: It is greater than 7 by 3. This means the difference ( 7 7) is 3.
