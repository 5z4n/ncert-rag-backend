this 2-D representation of a 3-D solid. 6. Two types of sketches of a solid are possible: (a) Anoblique sketch does not have proportional lengths. Still it conveys all important aspects of the appearance of the solid. (b) Anisometric sketch is drawn on an isometric dot paper, a sample of which is given at the end of this book. In an isometric sketch of the solid the measurements kept proportional. 7. Visualising solid shapes is a very useful skill. You should be able to see hidden parts of the solid shape. 8. Different sections of a solid can be viewed in many ways: (a) One way is to view by cutting or slicing the shape, which would result in the cross-section of the solid. (b) Another way is by observing a 2-D shadow of a 3-D shape. (c) Athird way is to look at the shape from different angles; the front-view, the side-view and the top-view can provide a lot of information about the shape observed. 2024-25
