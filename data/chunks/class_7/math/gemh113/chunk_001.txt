called nets. 13.3 NeEtTs For. Burtpinc 3-D SHAPES Take a cardboard box. Cut the edges to lay the box flat. You have now a net for that box. A net is a sort of skeleton-outline in 2-D [Fig13.4 (i)], which, when folded [Fig13.4 (11)], results in a 3-D shape [Fig 13.4 (iii)]. \ Fig 13.4 2024-25 VISUALISING SOLID SHAPES iD iii i il Here you got a net by suitably separating the edges. Is the reverse process possible? Here is a net pattern for a box (Fig 13.5). Copy an enlarged version of the net and try to make the box by suitably folding and gluing together. (You may use suitable units). The box is a solid. It is a 3-D object with the shape of a cuboid. Similarly, you can get a net for a cone by cutting a slit along its slant surface (Fig 13.6). You have different nets for different shapes. Copy enlarged versions of the nets given (Fig 13.7) and try to make Cube Cylinder Cone the 3-D shapes indicated. (You may also like to prepare skeleton models using strips of cardboard fastened with paper clips). Cut along here Fig 13.6 (i) (ii) (iit) HO EOS We could also try to make a net for making a pyramid like the Great Pyramid in Giza (Egypt) (Fig 13.8). That pyramid has a square base and triangles on the four sides. Fig 13.8 Fig 13.9 See if you can make it with the given net (Fig 13.9). 2024-25 i Hemarics Here you find four nets (Fig 13.10). There are two correct nets among them to make a tetrahedron. See if you can work out which nets will make a tetrahedron. YSN Fig 13.10 EXERCISE 13.1 1. Identify the nets which can be used to make cubes (cut out copies of the nets and try it): hoa ORS (i) (il) (iit) (iv) (v) (vi) 2. Dice are cubes with dots on each face. Opposite faces of a die always have a total of seven dots on them. Here are two nets to make dice (cubes); the numbers inserted in each square indicate the number of dots in that box. Insert suitable numbers in the blanks, remembering that the number on the opposite faces should total to 7. 3. Can this be a net for a die? Explain your answer. 2024-25 VISUALISING SOLID SHAPES iii (iii 4. Here is an incomplete net for making a cube. Complete it in at least two different ways. Remember that a cube has six faces. How many are there in the net here? (Give two separate diagrams. If you like, you may use a squared sheet for easy manipulation.) . Match the nets with appropriate solids: Zi (a) eo (i) > (b) a 1) (d) (iv) Play this game You and your friend sit back-to-back. One of you reads out a net to make a 3-D shape, while the other attempts to copy it and sketch or build the described 3-D object. 13.4 DrawinGc
