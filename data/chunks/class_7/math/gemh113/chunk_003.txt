we need what is known as an isometric sheet. Let us try to 2024-25 VISUALISING SOLID SHAPES iii, Ti iii make a cuboid with dimensions 4 cm length, 3 cm breadth and 3 cm height on given isometric sheet. 13.4.2 Isometric Sketches Have you seen an isometric dot sheet? (A sample is given at the end of the book). Sucha sheet divides the paper into small equilateral triangles made up of dots or lines. To draw sketches in which measurements also agree with those of the solid, we can use isometric dot sheets. [Given on inside of the back cover (3rd cover page). ] Let us attempt to draw an isometric sketch of a cuboid of dimensions 4 x 3 x 3 (which means the edges forming length, breadth and height are 4, 3, 3 units respectively) (Fig 13.13). Step 1 Draw a rectangle to show the front face. Step 3 Connect the matching corners with appropriate line segments. Note that the measurements are of exact size in an isometric sketch; 6 this is not so in the case of an oblique sketch. EXAMPLE 1 Hereisan oblique sketch of a cuboid [Fig 13.14()]. f Draw an isometric sketch that matches this drawing. Step 2 Draw four parallel line segments of length 3 starting from the four corners of the rectangle. Step 4 This is an isometric sketch of the cuboid. Fig 13.13 SOLUTION Hereis the solution [Fig 13.14(1)]. Note how the a or Fig 13.14 (i) measurements are taken care of. Fig 13.14 (ii) 2024-25 EE emarics How many units have you taken along (i) length ? (ii) breadth ? (iii) height ? Do they match with the units mentioned in the oblique sketch? EXERCISE 13.2 1. Use isometric dot paper and make an isometric sketch for each one of the given shapes: ENENSEEE | | Yat | (i Fig 13.15 (iv) 2. The dimensions of acuboid are 5 cm, 3 cm and2cm. Draw three different isometric sketches of this cuboid. 3. Three cubes each with 2 cm edge are placed side by side to form a cuboid. Sketch an oblique or isometric sketch of this cuboid. 4. Make an oblique sketch for each one of the given isometric shapes: 2024-25 VISUALISING SOLID SHAPES 5. Give (1) an oblique sketch and (i1) an isometric sketch for each of the following: (a) Acuboid of dimensions 5 cm, 3 cm and 2 cm. (Is your sketch unique?) (b) A cube with an edge 4cm long. An isometric sheet is attached at the end of the book. You could try to make on it some cubes or cuboids of dimensions specified by your friend. 13.4.3 Visualising Solid Objects Sometimes when you look at combined shapes, some of them may be hidden from your view. Here are some activities you could try in your free time to help you visualise some solid objects and how they look. Take some cubes and arrange them as shown in Fig 13.16. 7 Ff A 7 (i 7
