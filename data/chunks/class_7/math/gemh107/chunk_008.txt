=%12 = (100 10) == 90 Therefore When CP is = 100, SP is = 90. SP = CP - Loss Therefore, if CP were = 120 then = % 120 -= 12 == 108 SP = Eo x120 == 108 Thus, by both methods we get the SP as 100 = 108. 2024-25 MATHEMATICS EXAMPLE 13 Selling price of a toy car is % 540. If the profit made by shopkeeper is 20%, what is the cost price of this toy? i SOLUTION Weare given that SP=% 540 and the Profit = 20%. We need to find the CP. Amina does it like this Arun does it like this 20% profit will mean if CP is = 100, Profit = 20% of CP and SP=CP + Profit profit is = 20 So, 540 = CP + 20% of CP Therefore, SP = 100 + 20 = 120 20 | fe Now, when SP is = 120, =CP+ 59 xCP= Hr then CP is = 100. Therefore, when SP is = 540, _6 CP. Therefore, 540x SA cp 2 6 then CP = X50 == 450 or = 450 = CP Thus, by both methods, the cost price is 450. 1. Ashopkeeper bought a chair for = 375 and sold it for = 400. Find the gain Percentage. 2. Cost of an item is = 50. It was sold with a profit of 12%. Find the selling price. 3. Anarticle was sold for? 250 with a profit of 5%. What was its cost price? 4. Anitem was sold for = 540 at a loss of 5%. What was its cost price? 7.4 CHARGE GIVEN.ON BORROWED MONEY oR SIMPLE INTEREST Sohini said that they were going to buy a new scooter. Mohan asked her whether they had the money to buy it. Sohini said her father was going to take a loan from a bank. The money you borrow is known as sum borrowed or principal. This money would be used by the borrower for some time before it is returned. For keeping this money for some time the borrower has to pay some extra money to the bank. This is known as Interest. You can find the amount you have to pay at the end of the year by adding the sum borrowed and the interest. That is, Amount = Principal + Interest. Interest is generally given in per cent for a period of one year. It is written as say 10% per year or per annum or in short as 10% p.a. (per annum). 10% p.a. means on every & 100 borrowed, = 10 is the interest you have to pay for one year. Let us take an example and see how this works. EXAMPLE 14 Anita takes a loan of = 5,000 at 15% per year as rate of interest. Find the interest she has to pay at the end of one year. 2024-25 COMPARING QUANTITIES iii is SOLUTION The sum borrowed = 5,000, Rate of interest =
