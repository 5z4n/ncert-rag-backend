sr emarics Colour Number | Fraction | Denominator Hundred In Percentage of Beads Sars 0" oo Bh a 60% ue 20 i007 a Anwar found the Percentage of red beads like this Asha does it like this Out of 20 beads, the number of red beads is 8. 8 8x5 Hence, out of 100, the number of red beads is 20 20x5 = = 40% 8 100 = 40 (out of hundred) = 40% 40 20 100 We see that these three methods can be used to find the Percentage when the total does not add to give 100. In the method shown in the table, we multiply the fraction by 100 00 denominator. . This does not change the value of the fraction. Subsequently, only 100 remains in the Anwar has used the unitary method. Asha has multiplied by 5 to get 100 in the denominator. You can use whichever method you find suitable. May be, you can make your own method too. The method used by Anwar can work for all ratios. Can the method used by Asha also work for all ratios? Anwar says Asha s method can be used only if you can find a natural number which on multiplication with the denominator gives 100. Since denominator was 20, she could multiply it by 5 to get 100. If the denominator was 6, she would not have been able to use this method. Do you agree? | Ve 1. Acollection of 10 chips with different colours is given .

To compare fractional numbers, we need a common denominator and we have seen that it is more convenient to compare if our denominator is 100. That is, we are converting the fractions to Percentages. Let us try converting different fractional numbers to Percentages. EXAMPLE 1 Write = as per cent. 1 1 100 1 = x = x100% SOLUTION Wehave, 3 3% 100 3 0 ~ p00 % = 335% EXAMPLE 2 Out of 25 children in a class, 15 are girls. What is the percentage of girls? SOLUTION Outof 25 children, there are 15 girls. Therefore, percentage of girls = 35 x100 = 60. There are 60% girls
