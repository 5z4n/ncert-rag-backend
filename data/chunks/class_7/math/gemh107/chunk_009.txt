as 10% p.a. (per annum). 10% p.a. means on every & 100 borrowed, = 10 is the interest you have to pay for one year. Let us take an example and see how this works. EXAMPLE 14 Anita takes a loan of = 5,000 at 15% per year as rate of interest. Find the interest she has to pay at the end of one year. 2024-25 COMPARING QUANTITIES iii is SOLUTION The sum borrowed = 5,000, Rate of interest = 15% per year. This means if = 100 is borrowed, she has to pay 15 as interest for one year. If she has borrowed % 5,000, then the interest she has to pay for one year =z 100 x5000 =% 750 So, at the end of the year she has to give an amount of = 5,000 + = 750 = %5,750. We can write a general relation to find interest for one year. Take P as the principal or sum and R % as Rate per cent per annum. Now on every & 100 borrowed, the interest paid is = R RxP PXR 100 ~ 100 Therefore, on % P borrowed, the interest paid for one year would be 7.4.1 Interest for Multiple Years If the amount is borrowed for more than one year the interest is calculated for the period the money is kept for. For example, if Anita returns the money at the end of two years and the rate of interest is the same then she would have to pay twice the interest i.e., 750 for the first year and = 750 for the second. This way of calculating interest where principal is not changed is known as simple interest. As the number of years increase the interest also increases. For = 100 borrowed for 3 years at 18%, the interest to be paid at the end of 3 years is 18+ 18+ 18=3 x 18 =% 54. We can find the general form for simple interest for more than one year. We know that on a principal of = P at R% rate of interest per year, the interest paid for one year is . Therefore, interest / paid for T years would be TXRXP_PXRXT _ PRT = or 100 100 100 And amount you have to pay at the end of T years is A =P +1 1. = 10,000 is invested at 5% interest rate p.a.
