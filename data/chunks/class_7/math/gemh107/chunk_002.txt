converting the fractions to Percentages. Let us try converting different fractional numbers to Percentages. EXAMPLE 1 Write = as per cent. 1 1 100 1 = x = x100% SOLUTION Wehave, 3 3% 100 3 0 ~ p00 % = 335% EXAMPLE 2 Out of 25 children in a class, 15 are girls. What is the percentage of girls? SOLUTION Outof 25 children, there are 15 girls. Therefore, percentage of girls = 35 x100 = 60. There are 60% girls in the class. EXAMPLE 3 Convert q oper cent. 5 5 SOLUTION Wehave, rin 4 100% =125% 2024-25 EE LT i emarics From these examples, we find that the percentages related to proper fractions are less than 100 whereas percentages related to improper fractions are more than 100. Tuink, Discuss AND WRITE (i) Can you eat 50% of a cake? Can you eat 100% of a cake? Can you eat 150% of acake? (i) Cana price of anitem go up by 50%? Cana price of an item go up by 100%? Can a price of an item go up by 150%? 7.1.3 Converting Decimals to Percentage We have seen how fractions can be converted to per cents. Let us now find how decimals can be converted to per cents. EXAMPLE 4 Convert the given decimals to per cents: (a) 0.75 (b) 0.09 (c) 0.2 SOLUTION (a) 0.75 = 0.75 x 100 % (b) 0.09 = ~ =9 % - 109 % = 75% 109 ~o TP (c) 0.2= 0 * 100% = 20 % 1. Convert the following to per cents: 49 2 (a) 16 (b) 3.5 (c) 50 (d) 5 (e) 0.05 2. (i) Out of 32 students, 8 are absent. What per cent of the students are absent? (i) There are 25 radios, 16 of them are out of order. What per cent of radios are out of order? (ii) Ashop has 500 items, out of which 5 are defective. What per cent are defective? (iv) There are 120 voters, 90 of them voted yes. What per cent voted yes? 7.1.4 Converting Percentages to Fractions or Decimals We have so far converted fractions and decimals to percentages. We can also do the reverse. That is, given per cents, we can convert them to decimals or fractions. Look at the table, observe and complete it: 2024-25 COMPARING QUANTITIES iii hE is Per cent Make some more such examples and solve them. seract 1 1 raction | 700 | 100. 10 Decimal Foor | oo | | |] | Parts always add to give a whole In the examples for coloured tiles, for the heights of children and for gases XK Wa in the air, we find that when we add the Percentages we get 100. All the = parts that form the whole when added together gives the whole or 100%. Z| Ww So, if we are given one part, we can always find out the other part. Suppose, 30% of a given number of students are boys. This
