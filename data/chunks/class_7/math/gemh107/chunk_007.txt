CP SP. Let us try to interpret the statements related to prices of items. @ Atoy bought for = 72 is sold at = 80. @ A T-shirt bought for? 120 is sold at 100. @ Acycle bought for % 800 is sold for = 940. Let us consider the first statement. The buying price (or CP) is 72 and the selling price (or SP) is 80. This means SP is more than CP. Hence profit made = SP CP =% 80- %72=%8 Now try interpreting the remaining statements in a similar way. 7.3.1 Profit or Loss as a Percentage The profit or loss can be converted to a percentage. It is always calculated on the CP. For the above examples, we can find the profit % or loss %. Let us consider the example related to the toy. We have CP = 72, SP = = 80, Profit = = 8. To find the percentage of profit, Neha and Shekhar have used the following methods. 2024-25 COMPARING QUANTITIES iii hE is Neha does it this way Shekhar does it this way Profit 8 x 100 = = x100 Profit per cent = CP 79 On 72 the profit is 8 On 100, profit = 7 x100 7 1 Thus, the profit is 8 and } _ i Thus, profit per cent = lls profit Per cent is 1 re . Similarly you can find the loss per cent in the second situation. Here, CP =% 120, SP == 100. > Therefore, Loss = % 120 % 100 = 20 Lees veneers On Z 120, the loss is 20 p - So on = 100, the loss = 20 5. 100 2 20 1 120 120 50 2 2 => 165 Thus, loss per cent is 16 > Try the last case. Now we see that given any two out of the three quantities related to prices that is, CP, SP, amount of Profit or Loss or their percentage, we can find the rest. EXAMPLE 12 The cost of a flower vase is 120. If the shopkeeper sells it at a loss of 10%, find the price at which it is sold. SOLUTION Weare given that CP=% 120 and Loss per cent = 10. We have to find the SP. Sohan does it like this Anandi does it like this Loss of 10% means if CP is = 100, Loss is 10% of the cost price Loss is 10 = 10% of = 120 Therefore, SP would be = 100 =%12 = (100 10) == 90 Therefore When CP is = 100, SP is = 90. SP = CP - Loss Therefore, if CP were = 120 then = % 120 -= 12 == 108 SP = Eo x120 == 108 Thus, by both methods we get the SP as 100 = 108. 2024-25 MATHEMATICS EXAMPLE 13 Selling price of a toy car is % 540. If the profit made by shopkeeper is 20%, what is the cost price of
