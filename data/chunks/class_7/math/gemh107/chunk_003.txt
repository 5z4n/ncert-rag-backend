always add to give a whole In the examples for coloured tiles, for the heights of children and for gases XK Wa in the air, we find that when we add the Percentages we get 100. All the = parts that form the whole when added together gives the whole or 100%. Z| Ww So, if we are given one part, we can always find out the other part. Suppose, 30% of a given number of students are boys. This means that if there were 100 students, 30 out of them would be boys and the remaining would be girls. Then girls would obviously be (100 30)% = 70%. Try THESE 1. 35% + % = 100%, 64% + 20% + % =100% 45% = 100% %, 10% = % 30% 2. If65% of students in a class have a bicycle, what per cent | of the student do not have bicycles? ry 3. We have a basket full of apples, oranges and mangoes. If 50% are apples, 30% are oranges, then what per cent are mangoes? TuHink, Discuss AND WRITE Consider the expenditure made on a dress 20% on embroidery, 50% on cloth, 30% on stitching. Can you think of more such examples? 2024-25 EE LC i emarics 7.1.5 Fun with Estimation Percentages help us to estimate the parts of an area. EXAMPLE 5 What percent of the adjoining figure is shaded? SOLUTION We first find the fraction of the figure that is shaded. From this fraction, the percentage of the shaded part can be found. 1 You will find that half of the figure is shaded. And, 779% 100 % =50 % Thus, 50 % of the figure is shaded. Try THESE What per cent of these figures are shaded? @ (it) ee Tangram You can make some more figures yourself and ask your friends to estimate the shaded parts. 7.2 USE oF PERCENTAGES 7.2.1 Interpreting Percentages We saw how percentages were helpful in comparison. We have also learnt to convert fractional numbers and decimals to percentages. Now, we shall learn how percentages can be used in real life. For this, we start with interpreting the following statements: 5% of the income is saved by Ravi. 20 % of Meera s dresses are blue in colour. Rekha gets 10% on every book sold by her. What can you infer from each of these statements? By 5 % we mean 5 parts out of 100 or we write it as 700: It means Ravi is saving =5 out of every = 100 that he earns. In the same way, interpret the rest of the statements given above. 7.2.2 Converting Percentages to How Many Consider the following examples: EXAMPLE 6 A survey of 40 children showed that 25% liked playing football. How many children liked playing football? SOLUTION Here, the total number of children are 40. Out of these, 25% like playing football. Meena and Arun used the following methods to find the number. You can choose either method. 2024-25
