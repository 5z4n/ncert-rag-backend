every = 100 that he earns. In the same way, interpret the rest of the statements given above. 7.2.2 Converting Percentages to How Many Consider the following examples: EXAMPLE 6 A survey of 40 children showed that 25% liked playing football. How many children liked playing football? SOLUTION Here, the total number of children are 40. Out of these, 25% like playing football. Meena and Arun used the following methods to find the number. You can choose either method. 2024-25 COMPARING QUANTITIES iii as Arun does it like this Out of 100, 25 like playing football So out of 40, number of children who like Meena does it like this ~ x40 25% of 40 = 759 25 = lt laying football = x 40 = 10 Pray 1100 Hence, 10 children out of 40 like playing football. 1. Find: ly (a) 50% of 164 (b) 75% of 12 (c) las % of 64 2. 8%children of aclass of 25 like getting wet in the rain. How many children like getting wet in the rain. EXAMPLE 7 Rahul bought a sweater and saved % 200 when a discount of 25% was given. What was the price of the sweater before the discount? SOLUTION _ Rahulhas saved? 200 when price of sweater is reduced by 25%. This means that 25% reduction in price is the amount saved by Rahul. Let us see how Mohan and Abdul have found the original cost of the sweater. Abdul s solution = 25 is saved for every = 100 Amount for which & 200 is saved Mohan s solution 25% of the original price =% 200 Let the price (in ) be P 75 800 So, 25% of P = 200 or xP = 200 P_ 200 _ Thus both obtained the original price of 14 or P= 200 x4 sweater as = 800. Therefore, P = 800 1. 9is 25% of what number? 2. 75% of what number is 15? EXERCISE 7.1 1. Convert the given fractional numbers to per cents. 1 5 3 2 (a 8 (0) Z () 7 (d) = 2024-25 EE LC emarics 2.
