is 600. (b) 12% of it is = 1080. (c) 40% of it is 500 km. (d) 70% of itis 14 minutes. (e) 8% of itis 40 litres. 6. Convert given per cents to decimal fractions and also to fractions in simplest forms: (a) 25% (b) 150% (c) 20% (d) 5% 7. Inacity, 30% are females, 40% are males and remaining are children. What per cent are children? 8. Out of 15,000 voters in a constituency, 60% voted. Find the percentage of voters who did not vote. Can you now find how many actually did not vote? 9. Meeta saves % 4000 from her salary. If this is 10% of her salary. What is her salary? 10. A local cricket team played 20 matches in one season. It won 25% of them. How many matches did they win? 7.2.3 Ratios to Percents Sometimes, parts are given to us in the form of ratios and we need to convert those to percentages. Consider the following example: EXAMPLE 8 Reena s mother said, to make idlis, you must take two parts rice and one part urad dal. What percentage of such a mixture would be rice and what percentage would be urad dal? SOLUTION In terms of ratio we would write this as Rice : Urad dal=2: 1. 2 1 Now, 2 + 1=3 is the total of all parts. This means 3 part is rice and 3 part is urad dal. Then, percentage of rice would be : x100%= = = 665 %. 1 100 1 Percentage of urad dal would be 5 * 100 % = ae 33 3 % . 2024-25 COMPARING QUANTITIES EXAMPLE 9 If %250is to be divided amongst Ravi, Raju and Roy, so that Ravi gets two parts, Raju three parts and Roy five parts. How much money will each get? What will it be in percentages? SOLUTION The parts which the three boys are getting can be written in terms of ratios as2:3:5. Total of the parts is2+3+5= 10. Amounts received by each Percentages of money for each 2 . 2 7, x & 250 =F 50 Ravi gets x 100 % = 20 % 10 10 3 . 3 x = 250 =2%75 Raju gets x 100 % = 30 % 10 10 5 5 To 290 =F 125 Roy gets x10 % = 50 % 1. Divide 15 sweets between Manu and Sonu so that they get 20 % and 80 % of them respectively. 2. If angles of a triangle are in the ratio 2 : 3 : 4. Find the value of each angle. 7.2.4 Increase or Decrease as Per Cent There are times when we need to know the increase or decrease in a certain quantity as percentage. For example, if the population of a state increased from 5,50,000 to 6,05,000. Then the increase in population can be understood better if we say, the population increased by 10 %. How do we convert the increase or decrease in a quantity
