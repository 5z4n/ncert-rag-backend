the ratio 2 : 3 : 4. Find the value of each angle. 7.2.4 Increase or Decrease as Per Cent There are times when we need to know the increase or decrease in a certain quantity as percentage. For example, if the population of a state increased from 5,50,000 to 6,05,000. Then the increase in population can be understood better if we say, the population increased by 10 %. How do we convert the increase or decrease in a quantity as a percentage of the initial amount? Consider the following example. EXAMPLE 10Aschool team won 6 games this year against 4 games won last year. What is the per cent increase? SOLUTION Theincrease in the number of wins (or amount of change) = 6 4 =2. amount of change Percentage increase = - x 100 original amount or base increase in the number of wins 2 = : x100 = x 100 =50 original number of wins 4 EXAMPLE 11 The number of illiterate persons in a country decreased from 150 lakhs to 100 lakhs in 10 years. What is the percentage of decrease? SOLUTION Original amount=the number of illiterate persons initially = 150 lakhs. 2024-25 EE LS sr emarics Amount of change = decrease in the number of illiterate persons = 150 100 = 50 lakhs Therefore, the percentage of decrease amount of change 50 1 = _ x 100 = -x100 = 33original amount 150 3 1. Find Percentage of increase or decrease: Price of shirt decreased from = 280 to = 210. Marks in atest increased from 20 to 30. . My mother says, in her childhood petrol was | a litre. It is 52 per litre today. By what Percentage has the price gone up? 7.3 PRICES RELATED TO AN ITEM oR BUYING (AND SELLING I bought it for = 600 SHOP Lae) @: and will sell it for 610 The buying price of any item is known as its cost price. It is written in short as CP. The price at which you sell is known as the selling price or in short SP. What would you say is better, to you sell the item at a lower price, same price or higher price than your buying price? You can decide whether the sale was profitable or not depending on the CP and SP. If CP< SP then you made a profit = SP CP. If CP=SP then you are in ano profit no loss situation. If CP> SP then you have a loss = CP SP. Let us try to interpret the statements related to prices of items. @ Atoy bought for = 72 is sold at = 80. @ A T-shirt bought for? 120 is sold at 100. @ Acycle bought for % 800 is sold for = 940. Let us consider the first statement. The buying price (or CP) is 72 and the selling price (or SP) is 80. This means SP is more than CP. Hence profit made = SP CP
