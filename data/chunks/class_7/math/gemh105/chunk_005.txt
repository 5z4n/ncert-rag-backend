these segments (Fig 5.19). He claims they are parallel. How? Are you able to see that he has kept the corresponding angles to Fig 5.19 be equal? (What is the transversal here?) Thus, when a transversal cuts two lines, such that pairs of corresponding angles are equal, then the lines have to be parallel. Look at the letter Z(Fig 5.20). The horizontal segments here are parallel, because the alternate angles are equal. ZA When a transversal cuts two lines, such that pairs of alternate interior angles are equal, the lines have to be parallel. Fig 5.20 2024-25 EE i ematics Draw a line / (Fig 5.21). Draw a line m, perpendicular to /. Again draw a line p, ) such that p is perpendicular to m. Thus, p is perpendicular to a perpendicular to /. You find p Il 1. How? This is because you draw p such Fig 5.21 that 71 + 22 = 180 . Thus, when a transversal cuts two lines, such that pairs of interior angles on the same side of the transversal are supplementary, the lines have to be parallel.

When two lines /and m meet, we say they intersect; the meeting point is called the point of intersection. When lines drawn on a sheet of paper do not meet, however far produced, we call them to be parallel lines. 2024-25
