They are lines on a plane that do not meet anywhere. Can you identify parallel lines in the following figures? (Fig 5.16) Fig 5.16 Transversals of parallel lines give rise to quite interesting results. Take a ruled sheet of paper. Draw (in thick colour) two parallel lines / and m. Draw a transversal t to the lines / and m. Label 21 and 22 as shown [Fig 5.17()]. & Place a tracing paper over the figure drawn. Trace the lines /, m and t. Slide the tracing paper along , until / coincides with m. You find that 71 on the traced figure coincides with 22 of the original figure. In fact, you can see all the following results by similar tracing and sliding activity.

We use this result to get another interesting result. Look at Fig 5.18. When ft cuts the parallel lines, /, m, we get, 23 = Z7 (vertically opposite
