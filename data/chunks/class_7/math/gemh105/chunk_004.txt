We use this result to get another interesting result. Look at Fig 5.18. When ft cuts the parallel lines, /, m, we get, 23 = Z7 (vertically opposite angles). But 27 = Z8 (corresponding angles). Therefore, 23 = 28 57 ] You can similarly show that 271 = 26. Thus, we 3,1 have the following result : If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, each 6 8 m pair of alternate interior angles are equal. 42 This second result leads to another interesting property. Again, from Fig 5.18. Fig 5.18 2024-25 EE a i emarics 23+ Z1 =180 (23 and 21 form a linear pair) But 21 = 46 (A pair of alternate interior angles) Therefore, we can say that 23 + 26 = 180 . Similarly, 71+ 28 = 180 . Thus, we obtain the following result: If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then each pair of interior angles on the same side of the transversal are supplementary. You can very easily remember these results if you can look for relevant shapes . The F-shape stands for corresponding angles: at !| The Z - shape stands for alternate angles. Draw a pair of parallel lines and a transversal. Verify the above three statements by actually measuring the angles. 2024-25 LINES AND ANGLES iit Try THESE 60 g x m y a b Lines / || m; Lines a ll D; L,, L, be two lines tis a transversal cis a transversal tis a transversal Zx=?

When two lines are given, is there any method to check if they are parallel or not? You need this skill in many life-oriented situations. A draftsman uses a carpenter s square and a straight edge (ruler) to draw these segments (Fig 5.19). He claims they are parallel. How? Are you able to see that he has kept the corresponding angles to Fig 5.19 be equal? (What is the transversal here?) Thus, when a transversal cuts two lines, such that pairs of corresponding angles are equal, then the lines have to be parallel. Look at the letter Z(Fig 5.20). The horizontal segments here are parallel, because the alternate angles are equal. ZA When a transversal cuts two lines, such
