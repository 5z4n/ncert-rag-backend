Both the numerator and denominator of this number are positive integers. Such a rational number is called a positive rational number. So, 9 etc. are positive rational numbers. Try THESE 3 1. Is 5 a positive rational The numerator of is anegative integer, whereas the denominator . . is a positive integer. Such a rational number is called a negative rational 2. List five more positive 5 3-9 rational numbers. number. So, >->->-> etc. are negative rational numbers. 7 5029-25 > 877" RATIONAL NUMBERS 8 8x-l1 -8 @ Is - a negative rational number? We know that > = 3x-17 3 and 3 1. Is 8 a negative 8 8 : 9 3 is anegative rational number. So, > is anegative rational number. rational number! -3 2. List five more 5 6 2 negative rational Similarly, 7 5 _9 etc. are all negative rational numbers. Note that numbers. their numerators are positive and their denominators negative. @ The number 0 is neither a positive nor a negative rational number. @ What about =3 ? ~~ 8g _3y (LE 3 You will see that 3 = 3x ( 1) = 3 . 50, z 1S a positive rational number. - -5x(-l) 5 > 2 -5 Thus, 5-3 etc. are positive rational numbers. Va! Which of these are negative rational numbers? 2 5 A Jon o 6 . 2 o> @F> wt 3 w& M7 i) = 8.5 RationaL NuMBERS ON A NuMBER LINE You know how to represent integers on a number line. Let us draw one such number line. 4 3 2 l 0 1 2 3 4 The points to the right of 0 are denoted by + sign and are positive integers. The points to the left of 0 are denoted by sign and are negative integers. Representation of fractions on a number line is also known to you. Let us see how the rational numbers can be represented on a number line. Let us represent the number 5 on the number line. As done in the case of positive integers, the positive rational numbers would be marked on the right of 0 and the negative rational numbers would be marked on the left of 0. To which side of 0 will you mark ; ? Being a negative rational number, it would be marked to the left of 0. You know that while marking integers on the number line, successive integers are marked at equal intervels. Also, from 0, the pair 1 and 1 is equidistant. So are the pairs 2 and 2, 3 and 3. 2024-25 128 ee 1 1 In the same way, the rational numbers > and > would be at equal distance from 0. We know how to mark the rational number = . It is marked at a point which
