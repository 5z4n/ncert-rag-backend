where p and q are integers and q # 0. A Thus, 5 is arational number. Here, p=4 and g=5S. Is 4 also a rational number? Yes, because p = 3 and q =4 are integers. 3 4.2 @ You have seen many fractions like 878 1 3 etc. All fractions are rational numbers. Can you say why? How about the decimal numbers like 0.5, 2.3, etc.? Each of such numbers can be written as an ordinary fraction and, hence, are rational numbers. For example, 0.5 = 10 ; 0.333 333 333 = O99 etc. 1. Is the number 3 rational? Think aboutit. 2. List ten rational numbers. ). Numerator and Denominator I the integer p is the numerator, and the integer g (#0) is the denominator. ASS ne qd -3 Thus, in 7 the numerator is 3 and the denominator is 7. Mention five rational numbers each of whose (a) Numerator is a negative integer and denominator is a positive integer. (b) Numerator is a positive integer and denominator is a negative integer. (c) Numerator and denominator both are negative integers. (d) Numerator and denominator both are positive integers. @ Ate integers also rational numbers? Any integer can be thought of as a rational number. For example, the integer 5 is a rational number, because you can write it as n . The integer 0 can also be written as 0= 3 or 7 etc. Hence, it is also a rational number. Thus, rational numbers include integers and fractions. 2024-25 EE Hematics Equivalent rational numbers A rational number can be written with different numerators and denominators. For example, consider the rational number . ah -2 2x2 -4 2 _4 . We see that is the same as . 3 3x2 6 3 6 ar -2 (-2)x(5)_ 10 5 2- Iso th 10 so, 3 = 3x(-5) 75 30 3 iSalso the same as =. -2 - 10 ; ; Thus, 3 = 6 TOS" Such rational numbers that are equal to each other are said to be equivalent to each other. Acai 10 10 How? gain, 15 = 75 | ow?) By multiplying the numerator and denominator of a rational number by the same non zero integer, we obtain another rational number equivalent to the given rational number. This is exactly like Fill in the boxes: obtaining equivalent fractions. Just as multiplication, the division of the numerator and denominator _ 35 ~LI_ 25 _ =15 by the same non zero integer, also gives equivalent rational numbers. For 0 4 16 example, 3 9 6 10 10+(-5) -2 -12 12412 -1 @ 714 -15 -15+(-5) 3 24 ~ 24212 2 8.4 PosITIVE AND NEGATIVE RaTIONAL NUMBERS Consider the rational number 3 . Both the numerator and denominator of this number are positive integers. Such a rational number is called a positive rational number. So, 9 etc. are positive rational numbers. Try THESE 3 1. Is 5 a positive rational The numerator of is anegative integer, whereas the denominator . .
