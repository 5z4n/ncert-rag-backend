Are the two values same? So, we find that while adding rational numbers with same denominators, we add the numerators keeping the denominators same. -l11 7 -1147 -4 + = = 5 65 5 5 Thus, @ How do we add rational numbers with different denominators? As in the case of fractions, we first find the LCM of the two denominators. Then, we find the equivalent rational numbers of the given rational numbers with this LCM as the denominator. Then, add the two rational numbers. For example, let us add = and = . LCM of 5 and 3 is 15. s -7_-21 ,-2_-10 % 5 15 3. 15 -7 (2) -21 (10) -31 Ts ee D211) _ 5 3 15 15 15 Try THESE woe Additive Inverse Find: -4 4 . 3,2 a9 (i) >t What will be 77 _ _ -4 4 -4+4 4 (-4 6 11 7 7 7 7 7 2024-25 RATIONAL NUMBERS 2 2 2 (-2 Similarly, = +7 =9=7+ 3 3 3 3 In the case of integers, we call 2 as the additive inverse = of 2 and 2 as the additive inverse of 2.

EXAMPLE 6Satpal walks 3 km from a place P, towards east and then from there a 1 7 km towards west. Where will he be now from P? SOLUTION Let us denote the distance travelled towards east by positive sign. So, the distances towards west would be denoted by negative sign. Thus, distance of Satpal from the point P would be 2 *) 2 (-12) 2x7 (-12)x3 +| -l=]= =+ = + 3 7) 3 7 3X7 7x3 14-36 -22 1 1 21 21 21 Since it is negative, it means Satpal is at a distance | 1 km towards west of P. 8.9.2 Subtraction 5 3 Savita found the difference of two rational numbers 4 and 8 in this way: 5 3 40-21 19
