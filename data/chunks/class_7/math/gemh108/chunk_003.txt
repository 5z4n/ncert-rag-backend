the left of 0. You know that while marking integers on the number line, successive integers are marked at equal intervels. Also, from 0, the pair 1 and 1 is equidistant. So are the pairs 2 and 2, 3 and 3. 2024-25 128 ee 1 1 In the same way, the rational numbers > and > would be at equal distance from 0. We know how to mark the rational number = . It is marked at a point which is half the 1 distance between 0 and 1. So, 5 would be marked at a point half the distance between O and -1. < _ tro _tr to__eae ] -l 0 1 1 2 2 We know how to mark 3 on the number line. It is marked on the right of 0 and lies halfway between | and 2. Let us now mark > on the number line. It lies on the left of 0 and is at the same distance as = from 0. . | -2 3-4 In decreasing order, we have, = (=-l, Tay OD (= 2). This shows that -3 > lies between | and 2. Thus, lies halfway between | and 2. 5 -7 Mark > and > ina similar way. 1 1 Similarly, 3 is to the left of zero and at the same distance from zero as 3 is to the right. So as done above, = can be represented on the number line. Once we know how 2 4 5 to represent 3 on the number line, we can go on representing 37373 and so on. All other rational numbers with different denominators can be represented in a similar way. 8.6 RatTionaL NuMBERS IN STANDARD FORM . 3 -5 2 -7 Observe the rational numbers , , , . 5 8 7 Il The denominators of these rational numbers are positive integers and | is the only common factor between the numerators and denominators. Further, the negative sign occurs only in the numerator. Such rational numbers are said to be in standard form. 2024-25 RATIONAL NUMBERS ie oe A rational number is said to be in the standard form if its denominator is a positive integer and the numerator and denominator have no common factor other than 1, If a rational number is not in the standard form, then it can be reduced to the standard form. Recall that for reducing fractions to their lowest forms, we divided the numerator and the denominator of the fraction by the same non zero positive integer. We shall use the same method for reducing rational numbers to their standard form. EXAMPLE 1] Reduce 30 to the standard form. 45 -45+3 -15_ -15+5_ -3 30 3073 10 '10+5 We had to divide twice. First time by 3 and then by 5. This could also be done as 45 -45+15_ -3 30 302152 In this example, note that 15 is the HCF of 45 and 30. Thus, to reduce the rational number to its standard
