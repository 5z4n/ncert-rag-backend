Find: Based on these observations, we find that, Step 2 Multiply the denominators of the two rational numbers.

What is the reciprocal of 7 ? It will be 5 We extend this idea of reciprocals to non-zero rational numbers also. The reciprocal of 7 will be > 1.e., > ; that of 5 would be 37 2024-25 EO emarics ! 6 -8 What will be the reciprocal of [| ? and = ? Ni Product of reciprocals The product of a rational number with its reciprocal is always 1} xX rei rocal of 3) For example, 9 p 9 4 5 Savita divided a rational number 9 by another rational number 7 as, 4. -5_4. 7-28 = 9 7 9 -5 45 ~ She used the idea of reciprocal as done in fractions. f it first divided b > d 28 Arpit first divide g by = an got 45 He finally said 4.3.78 How didh hat? e y sai 9 7 45: Howdi e get that? He divided them as fractions, ignoring the negative sign and then put the negative sign in the value so obtained. 28 2 -5 Both of them got the same value 45 Try dividing 3 by 7 both ways and see if you get the same answer. This shows, to divide one rational number by the other non-zero rational number we multiply the rational number by the reciprocal of the other.
