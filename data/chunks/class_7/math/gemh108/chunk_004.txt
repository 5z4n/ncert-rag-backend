zero positive integer. We shall use the same method for reducing rational numbers to their standard form. EXAMPLE 1] Reduce 30 to the standard form. 45 -45+3 -15_ -15+5_ -3 30 3073 10 '10+5 We had to divide twice. First time by 3 and then by 5. This could also be done as 45 -45+15_ -3 30 302152 In this example, note that 15 is the HCF of 45 and 30. Thus, to reduce the rational number to its standard form, we divide its numerator and denominator by their HCF ignoring the negative sign, if any. (The reason for ignoring the negative sign will be studied in Higher Classes) SOLUTION Wehave, If there is negative sign in the denominator, divide by - HCP . EXAMPLE 2 Reduce to standard form: ay i) 15 SOLUTION (i) The HCF of 36 and 24 is 12. Thus, its standard form would be obtained by dividing by 12. 36 36+(-12) _ -3 24 -24+(-12) 2 (ii) The HCF of 3 and 15 is 3. -3 -3+(-2) 1 Thus, 15 -15=(-3) 5 Find the standard formof (@j) <= i) RY ind the standard form o (i) 45 (ii) 18 2024-25 EE semarics 8.7 COMPARISON OF RATIONAL NUMBERS We know how to compare two integers or two fractions and tell which is smaller or which is greater among them. Let us now see how we can compare two rational numbers. 2 5 @ Two positive rational numbers, like = and 7 can be compared as studied earlier in the case of fractions. | 1 , @ Mary compared two negative rational numbers 5 and 5 using number line. She knew that the integer which was on the right side of the other integer, was the greater integer. For example, 5 is to the right of 2 on the number line and 5 > 2. The integer 2 is on the right of 5 on the number line and 2> 5. She used this method for rational numbers also. She knew how to mark rational numbers 1 1 on the number line. She marked = and = as follows: 2 5 - J \ 0 1 ol_ne ol_2 10 5 10 1 5 Has she correctly marked the two points? How and why did she convert 5 to 10 1 ol vl 1 Thus, 57 7 oF >< 5 1 2 1 1 and "5 to To: She found that "5 is to the right of ~~. 3 2 1 1 -= --9?-= --? Can you compare 4 and 373 and 5. 1 1 1 We know from our study of fractions that = <> . And what did Mary get for > and 5 2 2 | ; ; 75! Was it not exactly the opposite? y= You will find that, 5 > but >< 5" D b h fe 3 2 d- lt ? o you observe the same for 4 33 and 3.757 Mary remembered that in integers she had studied 4 >3 but
