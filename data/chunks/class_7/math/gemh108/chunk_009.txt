would be denoted by negative sign. Thus, distance of Satpal from the point P would be 2 *) 2 (-12) 2x7 (-12)x3 +| -l=]= =+ = + 3 7) 3 7 3X7 7x3 14-36 -22 1 1 21 21 21 Since it is negative, it means Satpal is at a distance | 1 km towards west of P. 8.9.2 Subtraction 5 3 Savita found the difference of two rational numbers 4 and 8 in this way: 5 3 40-21 19 78 56 56 Farida knew that for two integers a and b she could write a b =a + ( b) 2024-25 EE VT HeMarics 5 3 5 She tried this for rational numbers also and found, 7 - 8 = + = Both obtained the same difference. 7 5 3 8 Try to find 8.9 117 in both ways. Did you get the same answer? So, we say while subtracting two rational numbers, we add the additive inverse of the rational number that is being subtracted, to the other rational number. rh 24-5 4 5S ' 5, (-14) ; _ = _ = + = 4 Us 3 5 3 5 3 additive inverse O 5 3 5 ~ 15 15 Find: 2 1 (-1) 2 5 | eo Se ; What will be 2-(2): 09-5 Gi)2o- = We 2-(3)- 7, additive inverse of (=) = 2. 5 = 47 =] 5 7 6 7 6 7 6 42 42 8.9.3 Multiplication 3 3 Let us multiply the rational number 5 by 2, i.e., we find = x2, On the number line, it will mean two jumps of 5 to the left. 6 - 4 -3 2 -1 5 5 5 5 5 5 1 2 3 5 = 9%) Where do we reach? We reach at 5 . Let us find it as we did in fractions. 3 -3x2 -6 xX2= = 5 5 5 We arrive at the same rational number. 4 6 Find =-* 3, 5% 4 using both ways. What do you observe? 2024-25 RATIONAL NUMBERS ike oe So, we find that while multiplying a rational number by a positive integer, we multiply the numerator by that integer, keeping the denominator unchanged. Let us now multiply a rational number by a negative integer, -2x(-5) _ 10 9 9 Remember, 5 can be written as 1 . Try THESE =x (-5) = 5 -5 10 -2x (5) What will be So, x =. 7 -3 -6 9 1 9 9x1 (i) xT? (ii) =x)? 3 3x(-2) -6 . . _ 2 = = _ Similarly, 1 ! ) lixl U 3 5_-3x5_=15 8 7 8x7 56 So, as we did in the case of fractions, we multiply two rational numbers in the following way: i Step 1 Multiply the numerators of the two rational numbers. Find: Based on these observations, we find that, Step 2 Multiply the denominators of the two rational numbers. Result of Step 1 i Step 3 Write the product as Result of
