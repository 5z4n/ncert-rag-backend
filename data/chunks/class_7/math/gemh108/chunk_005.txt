Jo compare two negative rational numbers, we compare them ignoring their negative signs and then reverse the order. 7 5 7 5 For example, to compare 5 and 3 we first compare 5 and 3 Wi f.2 d lude that > eget 7 <3 an conclude that 5 3 Take five more such pairs and compare them. chi 3 _2, 4 3, Which is greater gras Zor 5} @ Comparison of a negative and a positive rational number is obvious. A negative rational number is to the left of zero whereas a positive rational number is to the right of zero on anumber line. So, a negative rational number will always be less than a positive rational number.

From her earlier classes, she knew there would be exactly 6 whole numbers between 3 and 10. Similarly, she wanted to know the total number of integers between 3 and 3. The integers between 3 and 3 are 2, 1, 0, 1, 2. Thus, there are exactly 5 integers between 3 and 3. Are there any integers between 3 and 2? No, there is no integer between 3 and 2. Between two successive integers the number of integers is 0. 2024-25 MATHEMATICS Thus, we find that number of integers between two integers are limited (finite). Will the same happen in the case of rational numbers also? Reshma took two rational numbers = and =. She converted them to rational numbers with same denominators.
