part of the book will he read in 2 hours? SOLUTION The part of the book read by Sushant in 1 hour = 3 1 1 1 So, the part of the book read by him in a hours = a x5 Wot uxt = xX = 5 3 5x3 15 1 5 5 1 ind -x -=-x Let us now find 7 3 We know that 3 3 5. 1 5 21] 1. 1, 5 = = 5= OX ZF OX BX G 6 So 2024-25 EE Vs emarics Also. ~ x3 ag ty eS? 89 6 9x37 NS 9% 3 = 2x3 6 This is also shown by the figures drawn below. Each of these five equal shapes (Fig 2.10) are parts of five similar circles. Take one such shape. To obtain this shape we first divide a circle in three equal parts. Further divide each of these three parts in two equal parts. One part out of it is the shape we considered. What will it represent? 1 1 1 1 5 It will represent > x > = . The total of such parts would be 5X 7 = 7 2 3 6 6 6 Wecan thus find =x 2 as2 x 2 = <4 e can thus fin 35 SKS = . . . . Product of Numerators So, we find that we multiply two fractions as Product of Denominators > Value of the Products Try THESE You have seen that the product of two whole numbers is bigger than each of the two whole numbers. For example, 3 x 4= 12 and 12> 4, 12>3. What 8 4 3 2 _ happens to the value of the product when we multiply two fractions? 3 7 4 * 3 Letus first consider the product of two proper fractions. We have, 5 3 a xX- = a) x Ne) Il bi | 2 2024-25 FRACTIONS AND DECIMALS iA Di You will find that when two proper fractions are multiplied, the product is less than each of the fractions. Or, we say the value of the product of two proper fractions is smaller than each of the two fractions. Check this by constructing five more examples. Let us now multiply two improper fractions. 75 _35 357 355 ae iy mnaieifhevFenett 3 96 63 62 oduct is greater than each of the fractions 6 o 24 EO _ 5 3 15 9 7 63 xX = 3. 8 24 xX = Lag | mere | ee We find that the product of two improper fractions is greater than each of the two fractions. Or, the value of the product of two improper fractions is more than each of the two fractions. Construct five more examples for yourself and verify the above statement. Let us now multiply a proper and an improper fraction, say ; and : . 2 7 414 14. 7 14 2 We have 3% 5 =]5- Here, 15 <5 and 15 73 The product obtained
