of length 6 cm. He cuts this strip in smaller strips of length 2 cm each. You know that he would get 6 + 2 =3 strips. 2024-25 FRACTIONS AND DECIMALS ii Ri i ii John cuts another strip of length 6 cm into smaller strips of length zeom each. How many strips will he get now? He will get 6 + 5 strips. 15 3 A paper strip of length > emean be cut into smaller strips of length zom each to give 5 3), ~+z pieces. 2~2 So, we are required to divide a whole number by a fraction or a fraction by another fraction. Let us see how to do that. 2.2.1 Division of Whole Number by a Fraction Let us find it . We divide a whole into a number of equal parts such that each part is half of the whole. 1 1 The number of such half ( 3 ) parts would be 1+ 2 Observe the figure (Fig 2.11). How many half parts do you see? There are two half parts. me |b 1 2 1 So, 1+ = =2. Also, 1x ~=1x2=2. Thus, 1+ =1~x 2 1 2 1 1 ; Similarly, 3 +7 = number of 7 Parts obtained when each of the 3 whole, are divided Fig 2.11 into equal parts = 12 (From Fig 2.12) Fig 2.12 4 1 4 Observe also that, 3xo = 3x4 =12. Thus, 347 =3Xo = 12. 1 2 Find in a similar way, 3 + 3 and 3x a 2024-25 EE es i eMarics Reciprocal of a fraction The number can be obtained by interchanging the numerator and denominator of 1 1 3 1 5 oF by inverting >: Similarly, 1 is obtained by inverting 3 Let us first see about the inverting of such numbers. Observe these products and fill in the blanks : Multiply five more such pairs. The non-zero numbers whose product with each other is 1, are called the 5. 9 9 5 reciprocals of each other. So reciprocal of 9 is 5 and the reciprocal of 5 is 9 What =9 . . 5 is the receiprocal of 927! You will see that the reciprocal of 3 is obtained by inverting it. You get 2 . Tung, Discuss AND WRITE (i) Will the reciprocal of a proper fraction be again a proper fraction?
