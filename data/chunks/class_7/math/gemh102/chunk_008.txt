So, divide this --* part into 10 equal d tak 10 * 10 means 10 ! 10 o, divide this 10 part into 10 equal parts and take one part out of it.

That is, it represents 1, 1 1 1. 10 10 or 0.1 x 0. Can the dotted square be represented in some other way? How many small squares do you find in Fig 2.14? There are 100 small squares. So the dotted square represents one out of 100 or 0.01. Hence, 0.1 x 0.1 = 0.01. Note that 0.1 occurs two times in the product. In 0.1 there is eet fff fd one digit to the right of the decimal point. In 0.01 there are two digits (i.e., 1 + 1) to the right of the decimal point. Let us now find 0.2 x 0.3. We have, 0.2 x 0.3= 75% 10 V/V/V 7) | | | i 227 As we did for ~ , let us divide the square into 10 equal ZALAZA | | | 10 10 | | 3 parts and take three parts out of it, to get ~ 10 . Again divide each 2024-25 EE SE i eMarics 2 3 of these three equal parts into 10 equal parts and take two from each. We get 10 x 10 10 x = or 0.2 x 0.3. (Fig 2.15) Since there are 6 dotted squares out of 100, so they also reprsent 0.06. Thus, 0.2 x 0.3 = 0.06. Observe that 2 x 3 = 6 and the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in 0.06 is2(=1+1). The dotted squares represent Check whether this applies to 0.1 x 0.1 also. Find 0.2 x 0.4 by applying these observations. While finding 0.1 x 0.1 and 0.2 x 0.3, you might have noticed that first we multiplied them as whole numbers ignoring the decimal point. In 0.1 x 0.1, we found 01 x 01 or 1 x 1. Similarly in 0.2 x 0.3 we found 02 x 03 or 2 x 3. Then, we counted the number of digits starting from the rightmost digit and moved
