fraction by dividing by 10. Or, we say the decimal point was shifted by one place to the right in 0.5 to make it 5. So, there was a shift of one decimal point to the right in 25.5 also to make it 255. 22.5 225 _ Find 20.3 and 15.2 ina similar wa 1.19 28 Y- Find: (i) 0.25 (11) 002 (iii) 14 0.7 0.8 Let us now find 20.55 = 1.5. 3.96 2.31 We can write it is as 205.5 + 15, as discussed above. We get 13.7. Find 04 03" 2024-25 FRACTIONS AND DECIMALS Si i iii it 2. . . We can write it as = (How?) and we get the quotient Consider now, on as 134.9. How will you find ne ? We know that 27 can be written as 27.00. 27 _ 27.00 _ 2700 _ 4 0.03 0.03 3 ~ So, EXAMPLE 6. Eachside of aregular polygon is 2.5 cm in length. The perimeter of the polygon is 12.5cm. How many sides does the polygon have? SOLUTION The perimeter of a regular polygon is the sum of the lengths of all its equal sides = 12.5 cm. ; 12.5 125 Length of each side =2.5cm. Thus, the number of sides = 35 = 35 =5 The polygon has 5 sides. EXAMPLE 7 Acarcoversa distance of 89.1 km in 2.2 hours. What is the average distance covered by it in 1 hour? SOLUTION Distance covered by the car = 89.1 km. Time required to cover this distance = 2.2 hours. EXERCISE 2.5 1.

Avehicle covers a distance of 43.2 km in 2.4 litres of petrol. How much distance will it cover in one litre of petrol? WHAT HAVE WE DISCUSSED? . Wehave learnt how to multiply fractions. Two fractions are multiplied by multiplying their numerators and denominators seperately and writing the product as 5 2x5 10 product of numerators x 3. 7 3x7 21 - . For example, product of denominators P . A fraction acts as an operator of . For example, ; of 2 is : x2=1. . (a) The product of two proper fractions is less than each of the fractions that are multiplied. (b) The product of a proper and an improper fraction is less than the improper fraction and greater than the proper
