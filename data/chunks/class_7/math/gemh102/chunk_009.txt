applies to 0.1 x 0.1 also. Find 0.2 x 0.4 by applying these observations. While finding 0.1 x 0.1 and 0.2 x 0.3, you might have noticed that first we multiplied them as whole numbers ignoring the decimal point. In 0.1 x 0.1, we found 01 x 01 or 1 x 1. Similarly in 0.2 x 0.3 we found 02 x 03 or 2 x 3. Then, we counted the number of digits starting from the rightmost digit and moved towards left. We then put the decimal point there. The number of digits to be counted is obtained by adding the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in the decimal numbers that are being multiplied. Let us now find 1.2 x 2.5. Multiply 12 and 25. We get 300. Both, in 1.2 and 2.5, there is | digit to the right of the decimal point. So, count 1 + 1 =2 digits from the rightmost digit (i.e., 0) in 300 and move towards left. We get 3.00 or 3. Find in a similar way 1.5 x 1.6, 2.4 x 4.2. While multiplying 2.5 and 1.25, you will first multiply 25 and 125. For placing the decimal in the product obtained, you will count 1 + 2=3 (Why?) digits starting from the rightmost digit. Thus, 2.5 x 1.25 =3.225 Find 2.7 x 1.35. 1. Find: (i) 2.7x 4 (ii) 1.8 x 1.2 (iii) 2.3 x 4.35 2. Arrange the products obtained in (1) in descending order. EXAMPLE 3 The side of an equilateral triangle is 3.5 cm. Find its perimeter. SOLUTION All the sides of an equilateral triangle are equal. 2024-25 FRACTIONS AND DECIMALS So, length of each side = 3.5 cm Thus, perimeter = 3 x 3.5cm= 10.5 cm EXAMPLE 4 The length of a rectangle is 7.1 cm and its breadth is 2.5 cm. What is the area of the rectangle? SOLUTION Length of the rectangle = 7.1 cm Breadth of the rectangle = 2.5 cm Therefore, area of the rectangle = 7.1 x 2.5 cm? = 17.75 cm? 2.3.1 Multiplication of Decimal Numbers by 10, 100 and 1000 23 235 Reshma observed that 2.3 = 10 whereas 2.35 = 700 Thus, she found that depending on the position of the decimal point the decimal number can be converted to a fraction with denominator 10 or 100. She wondered what would happen ifa decimal number is multiplied by 10 or 100 or 1000. Let us see if we can find a pattern of multiplying numbers by 10 or 100 or 1000. Have a look at the table given below and fill in the blanks: 1.76 x 10 = 100 * 10= 17.6 2.35. x10 =_ 12.356 x 10 =__ 1.76 x 100 = 100 * 100 = 176 or 176.0] 2.35 x100=__s |: 12.356 x 100 =___ 1.76 x 1000 = 100 * 1000 = 1760. or | 2.35 x1000 =____} 12.356 x 1000 = 0.5 x 10= 79 x 10=5 ; O05x100=_ ; O5x1000=__
