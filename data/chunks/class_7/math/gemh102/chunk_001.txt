whole number with a proper or an improper fraction, we multiply the whole number with the numerator of the fraction, keeping the denominator same. 2 9 1 13 1. Find: (a) 5x3 (b) 5X6 ( ) 3x5 Wd) 7 *6 If the product is an improper fraction express it as a mixed fraction. f(t 274 2. Represent pictorially: 2x 5 ~ 5 To multiply a mixed fraction to a whole number, first convert the ae Ste mixed fraction to an improper fraction and then multiply. Find: (i) 5x2 3x95 = ay 9 57 _g! 7 Therefore, 7 = 7 = = 8. (ii) 15x6 Similarly, 2x4 _ x= =? Fraction as an operator of Observe these figures (Fig 2.6) The two squares are exactly similar. Each shaded portion represents 3 of 1. So, both the shaded portions together will represent 5 of 2. Combine the 2 shaded > parts. It represents 1. 1 1 So, we say 5 of 2 is 1. We can also get it as 5 x2=1. 1 1 Thus, 5 of 2= 5 x2=1 Fig 2.6 2024-25 FRACTIONS AND DECIMALS iP iii Also, look at these similar squares (Fig 2.7). Each shaded portion represents 3 of 1. So, the three shaded portions represent 5 of 3. Combine the 3 shaded parts. 1. It represents Is 1.e., 2 Fig 2.7 S f3is >. Al 3 0, 5 of 3is 5. Also, 5 x3= Th + f3 + 3 ; us, 5 0 = x3=5 So we see that of represents multiplication. N | bw Farida has 20 marbles. Reshma has : th of the number of marbles what. Farida has. How many marbles Reshma has? As, of indicates multiplication, so, Reshma has 5 x 20 =4 marbles. Similar] h 1 f 161 + x16 o imilarly, we have 5 of 16 is 5 =5 Try THESE 1 1 2 Can you tell, what is (1) 5 of 10?, (41) 7 of 16?, (iii) 5 of 25? = 8. EXAMPLE I Inaclass of 40 students 5 of the total number of studetns like to study English, 5 of the total number like to study Mathematics and the remaining students like to study Science. (it) How many students like to study English? (ii) How many students like to study Mathematics? (ii) What fraction of the total number of students like to study Science? SOLUTION Total number of students in the class = 40. (i) Ofthese 5 of the total number of students like to study English. 2024-25 EE a i emarics 1 1 Thus, the number of students who like to study English = = of 40 = =X 40 =8. (i) Try yourself. (ii) The number of students who like English and Mathematics = 8 + 16 = 24. Thus, the number of students who like Science = 40 24 = 16. Thus, the required fraction is es . EXERCISE 2.1 1. Which of the drawings (a) to (d) show : (i) 2x- (ii) 2x2 (iii) 3x5 (iv)
