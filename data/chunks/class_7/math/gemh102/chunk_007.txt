How much money should she pay? Certainly it would be = (8.50 x 1.50). Both 8.5 and 1.5 are decimal numbers. So, we have come across a situation where we need to know how to multiply two decimals. Let us now learn the multiplication of two decimal numbers. First we find 0.1 x 0.1. 1 1 1 Now, 0.1 = 10 3 0.1 x O1= x75 = ixl - _o01 10x10 100 Let us see it s pictorial representation (Fig 2.13) The fraction 10 represents | part out of 10 equal arts.
