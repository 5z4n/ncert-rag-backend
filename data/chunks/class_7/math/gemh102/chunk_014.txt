and writing the product as 5 2x5 10 product of numerators x 3. 7 3x7 21 - . For example, product of denominators P . A fraction acts as an operator of . For example, ; of 2 is : x2=1. . (a) The product of two proper fractions is less than each of the fractions that are multiplied. (b) The product of a proper and an improper fraction is less than the improper fraction and greater than the proper fraction. (c) The product of two imporper fractions is greater than the two fractions. . A reciprocal of a fraction is obtained by inverting it upside down. . Wehave seen how to divide two fractions. (a) While dividing a whole number by a fraction, we multiply the whole number with the reciprocal of that fraction. For example, 22S=2x2= (b) While dividing a fraction by a whole number we multiply the fraction by the reciprocal of the whole number. For example, 2 7 a2 yh 2 3 7 21 (c) While dividing one fraction by another fraction, we multuiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the other. So, 2 + 5 = 2 x U = 4 . 3 7 3 5 15 . Wealso learnt how to multiply two decimal numbers. While multiplying two decimal numbers, first multiply them as whole numbers. Count the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in both the decimal numbers. Add the number of digits counted. Put the decimal point in the product by counting the digits from its rightmost place. The count should be the sum obtained earlier. For example, 0.5 x 0.7 = 0.35 2024-25 7. 8. FRACTIONS AND DECIMALS ii iii To multiply a decimal number by 10, 100 or 1000, we move the decimal point in the number to the right by as many places as there are zeros over 1. Thus 0.53 x 10=5.3, 0.53 x 100=53, 0.53 x 1000 = 530 We have seen how to divide decimal numbers. (a) To divide a decimal number by a whole number, we first divide them as whole numbers. Then place the decimal point in the quotient as in the decimal number. For example, 8.4+4=2.1 Note that here we consider only those divisions in which the remainder is zero. (b) To divide a decimal number by 10, 100 or 1000, shift the digits in the decimal number to the left by as many places as there are zeros over 1, to get the quotient. So, 23.9 + 10 = 2.39,23.9 + 100 = 0 .239, 23.9 + 1000 = 0.0239 (c) While dividing two decimal numbers, first shift the decimal point to the right by equal number of places in both, to convert the divisor to a whole number. Then divide. Thus, 2.4 +0.2 =24+2=12. 2024-25
