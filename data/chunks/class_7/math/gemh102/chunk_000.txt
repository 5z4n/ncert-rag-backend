Fractions and Decimals Chapter 2 2.1 MULTIPLICATION OF FRACTIONS You know how to find the area of a rectangle. It is equal to length x breadth. If the length and breadth of a rectangle are 7 cm and 4 cm respectively, then what will be its area? Its area would be 7 x 4 = 28 cm . What will be the area of the rectangle if its length and breadth are 7 zm and 1 . oD Lol 15 7 15 35 cm respectively? You will say it will be 7 5 x 3 5 = XG cm . The numbers > and 5 are fractions. To calculate the area of the given rectangle, we need to know how to multiply fractions. We shall learn that now. 2.1.1 Multiplication of a Fraction by a Whole Number ~ - 1 | ra DPD Observe the pictures at the left (Fig 2.1). Each shaded part is rm Vo \ -=j {=== ; partofacircle.

Thus, to multiply a whole number with a proper or an improper fraction, we multiply the whole number with the numerator of the fraction, keeping the denominator same. 2 9 1 13 1.
