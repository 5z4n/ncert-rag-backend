100 = 0.0238, 2.38 + 1000 = 0.00238 2.4.2 Division of a Decimal Number by a Whole Number Let us find . Remember we also write it as 6.4 + 2. Try THESE Qi) 35.7+3=?; 64 64 = 1 @) 25.5+3=? So, 6.4+2 = To +2= 10 2 as learnt in fractions. 64x1 1x64 1 = 64 ~= #1 32 = = = x = x 32 =a 3.2 10x2 10x2 10 2 10 10 Or, let us first divide 64 by 2. We get 32. There is one digit to the right of the decimal point in 6.4. Place the decimal in 32 such that there would be one digit to its right. We get 3.2 again. To find 19.5 +5, first find 195 +5. We get 39. There is one digit to the : right of the decimal point in 19.5. Place the decimal point in 39 such that there @) 43.15+5=%; would be one digit to its right. You will get 3.9. (ii) 82.44+6=? yp q 2024-25 EE a i emarics 1296 1296 1 1 1296 1 x 324 3.94 = +4- X = x = Find: (i) 15.5+5 Now, 12.96 = 4 100 100 4 100 4 100 (i) 126.35 +7 Or, divide 1296 by 4. You get 324. There are two digits to the right of the decimal in 12.96. Making similar placement of the decimal in 324, you will get 3.24. Note that here and in the next section, we have considered only those divisions in which, ignoring the decimal, the number would be completely divisible by another number to give remainder zero. Like, in 19.5 + 5, the number 195 when divided by 5, leaves remainder zero. However, there are situations in which the number may not be completely divisible by another number, i.e., we may not get remainder zero. For example, 195 +7. We deal with such situations in later classes. EXAMPLE 5 Find the average of 4.2, 3.8 and 7.6. SOLUTION Theaverage of 4.2, 3.8 and 7.6 is cee = =5.2. 2.4.3 Division of a-Decimal Number by another Decimal Number 25.5 Let us find 05 1e., 25.5 + 0.5. 255. 5 255 10 < =- = x = a = Wehave 25.5 +0.5 10 10 105 51. Thus, 25.5+0.5=51 What do you observe? For ~ , we find that there is one digit to the right of the 5.5 0.5 decimal in 0.5. This could be converted to whole number by dividing by 10. Accordingly 25.5 was also converted to a fraction by dividing by 10. Or, we say the decimal point was shifted by one place to the right in 0.5 to make it 5. So, there was a shift of one decimal point to the right in 25.5 also to make it 255. 22.5 225 _ Find 20.3 and 15.2 ina similar wa 1.19 28 Y- Find: (i) 0.25 (11) 002 (iii) 14 0.7 0.8 Let us now find 20.55 = 1.5. 3.96 2.31 We can write it is
