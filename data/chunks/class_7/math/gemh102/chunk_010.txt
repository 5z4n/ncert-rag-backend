by 10 or 100 or 1000. Have a look at the table given below and fill in the blanks: 1.76 x 10 = 100 * 10= 17.6 2.35. x10 =_ 12.356 x 10 =__ 1.76 x 100 = 100 * 100 = 176 or 176.0] 2.35 x100=__s |: 12.356 x 100 =___ 1.76 x 1000 = 100 * 1000 = 1760. or | 2.35 x1000 =____} 12.356 x 1000 = 0.5 x 10= 79 x 10=5 ; O05x100=_ ; O5x1000=__ Observe the shift of the decimal point of the products in the table. Here the numbers are multiplied by 10,100 and 1000. In 1.76 x 10= 17.6, the digits are same 1.e., 1,7 and 6. Do you observe this in other products also? Observe 1.76 and 17.6. To which side has the decimal point shifted, right or left? The decimal point has shifted to the right by one place. Note that 10 has one zero over 1. In 1.76x100 = 176.0, observe 1.76 and 176.0. To which side and by how many digits has the decimal point shifted? The decimal point has shifted to the right by two places. Note that 100 has two zeros over one. Do you observe similar shifting of decimal point in other products also? 2024-25 EE ee VT eMarics So we say, when a decimal number is multiplied by 10, 100 or 1000, the digits in the product are same as in the decimal number but the decimal point in the product is shifted to the right by as, many of places as there are zeros over one. Based on these observations we can now say Try THESE 0.07 x 10 = 0.7, 0.07 x 100 = 7 and 0.07 x 1000 = 70.
