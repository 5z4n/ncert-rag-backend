It will represent 5 of qo Nw |e x a NSENe) Let us now see how to find the product of two fractions like ; x - . To do this we first learn to find the products like : x : . (a) How do we find 3 of a whole? We divide the whole in three equal parts. Each of the three parts represents 3 of the whole. Take one part of these three parts, and shade it as shown in Fig 2.8. 1 1 (b) How will you find 5 of this shaded part? Divide this one-third G ) shaded part into x 3 (Fig 2.9). NO] Re 1 1 two equal parts. Each of these two parts represents 5 of 3 ie., Bole Take out | part of these two and name it A . A represents 5 (c) What fraction is A of the whole? For this, divide each of the remaining 3 parts also in two equal parts. How many such equal parts do you have now? There are six such equal parts. A is one of these parts. 1 1 ol 1 So, A is 6 of the whole. Thus, 5 x 3 = 6" How did we decide that A was of the whole? The whole was divided in 6 = 2 X 3 parts and 1 = 1 x 1 part was taken out of it. wh 1 1 1 1x1 us 2% 37 6 > 2x3 1 1 xi or 2 * 37 2x3 2024-25 FRACTIONS AND DECIMALS 1 1 The value of 3 x 5 can be found in a similar way. Divide the whole into two equal parts and then divide one of these parts in three equal parts. Take one of these parts. This will represent : x : ice. = 1 1 1 xl ; ; Therefore 3 x > = 67 3x2 as discussed earlier. 1 1 1 1 1 Hence 7%3 73% 976 11 1 1 1 Find 3 x mn and mn x 33 5 x 5 and =x ~ and check whether you get 11 1 1 1 1 1 1 3%4 74 %3 2%5 > 5% 2 Fill in these boxes: o bete Bt OO (ii) x5 =| lA (iv) =xz-[ |-[_] EXAMPLE 2 Sushant reads 3 Part of a book in 1 hour. How much part of the book will he read in 2 hours? SOLUTION The part of the book read by Sushant in 1 hour = 3 1 1 1 So, the part of the book read by him in a hours = a x5 Wot uxt = xX = 5 3 5x3 15 1 5 5 1 ind -x -=-x Let us now find 7 3 We know that 3 3 5. 1 5 21] 1. 1, 5 = = 5= OX
