She needed a few coloured strips of paper of length 1.9 cm each. She had a strip of coloured paper of length 9.5 cm. How many pieces of the required length will she get out of this strip? She thought it would be - cm. Is she correct? Both 9.5 and 1.9 are decimal numbers. So we need to know the division of decimal numbers too! 2.4.1 Division by 10, 100 and 1000 Let us find the division of a decimal number by 10, 100 and 1000. Consider 31.5 = 10. 2024-25 FRACTIONS AND DECIMALS ii PE RTT 31.5 +10 315 4 31 3.15 ee 10 10 ~ 100 Similarly, 31.5100 =x I 3b = 0.315 10 100 1000 Let us see if we can find a pattern for dividing numbers by 10, 100 or 1000. This may help us in dividing numbers by 10, 100 or 1000 in a shorter way. 31.5 + 10 = 3.15 231.5+10=__ 15+10=__ | 29.36+10=__ 31.5+100=0.315 | 231.5+10=__ 15+100=__ | 29.36+100=__ 31.5 +1000 = 0.0315] 231.5 + 1000 =___ | 1.5+1000=___ | 29.36 +1000 =___ Take 31.5 + 10 = 3.15. In 31.5 and 3.15, the digits are same i.e., 3, 1, and 5 but the decimal point has shifted in the quotient. To which side and by how many digits? The decimal ; ; point has shifted to the left by one place. Note that 10 has one we ee ae zero over 1. f a Gi) 235.4 +100 Consider now 31.5 + 100 = 0.315. In 31.5 and 0.315 the a (iii) 235.4 + 1000 digits are same, but what about the decimal point in the quotient? It has shifted to the left by two places. Note that 100 has two zeros over]. So we can say that, while dividing a number by 10, 100 or 1000, the digits of the number and the quotient are same but the decimal point in the quotient shifts to the left by as many places as there are zeros over 1. Using this observation let us now quickly find: 2.38 = 10 = 0.238, 2.38 + 100 = 0.0238, 2.38 + 1000 = 0.00238 2.4.2 Division of a Decimal Number by a Whole Number Let us find .
