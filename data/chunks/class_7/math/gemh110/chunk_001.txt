In (3x? 5) we first obtain x , and multiply it by 3 to get 3x . From 3x , we subtract 5 to finally arrive at 3x? 5. Describe how the following expressions are obtained: In xy, we multiply the variable x with another variable y. Thus, XxX y=xy. In 4xy + 7, we first obtain xy, multiply it by 4 to get 4xy and 22 2 add 7 to 4xy to get the expression. Ixy + 5, xy, 4x" Sx 10.3 TERMS OF AN EXPRESSION We shall now put in a systematic form what we have learnt above about how expressions are formed. For this purpose, we need to understand what terms of an expression and their factors are. Consider the expression (4x + 5). In forming this expression, we first formed 4x separately as a product of 4 and x and then added 5 to it. Similarly consider the expression (3x? + Jy). Here we first formed 3x separately as a product of 3, x and x. We then formed 7y separately as a product of 7 and y. Having formed 3x and 7y separately, we added them to get the expression. You will find that the expressions we deal with can always be seen this way. They have parts which are formed separately and then added. Such parts of an expression which are formed separately first and then added are known as terms. Look at the expression (4x* 3xy). We say that it has two terms, 4x? and 3xy. The term 4x is a product of 4, x and x, and the term ( 3xy) is a product of ( 3), x and y. Terms are added to form expressions. Just as the terms 4x and 5 are added to form the expression (4x + 5), the terms 4.x* and ( 3xy) are added to give the expression (4x 3xy). This is because 4x? + ( 3xy) = 4x? 3xy. Note, the minus sign ( ) is included in the term. In the expression 4x 3xy, we took the term as ( 3xy) and not as (3xy). That is why we do not need to say that terms are added or subtracted to form an expression; just added is enough. Factors of a term We saw above that the expression (4x? 3xy) consists of two terms 4x and 3xy. The term 4x is a product of 4, x and x; we say that 4, x and x are the factors of the term 4x . Aterm is a product of its factors. The term 3xy is a product of the factors 3, x and y. 2024-25 EE i emarics Expression (4x? 3xy) Terms 4x? 3xy 7 T, 7 On 7tn 7ItN ra iN iy N Factors 4 x x = # Expression (5xy + 10) Terms 5xy 10 ww aly 7 IN 7 i] N A 1 S, Factors 5 x y We can represent the terms and factors of the terms of an expression conveniently
