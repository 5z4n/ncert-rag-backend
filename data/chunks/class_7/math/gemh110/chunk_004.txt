a binomial; it is a Classify the following monomial. The expression (a + b + 5) is not a binomial. expressions as a monomial, It contains three terms. a binomial or a trinomial: a, a+b,ab+a+b,ab+a + b 5, xy, xy + 5, 5x -x +2, 4pq - 3q + 5p, 7,4m 7n + 10, 4mn +7. An expression which contains three terms is called a trinomial; for example, the expressions x + y+ 7, ab+a+tb, 3x 5x + 2, m+n + 10 are trinomials. The expression ab+a+b+5is, however not a trinomial; it contains four terms and not three. The expression x+ y+ 5x1is nota trinomial as the terms x and 5x are like terms. In general, an expression with one or more terms is called a polynomial. Thus a monomial, a binomial and a trinomial are all polynomials. EXAMPLE 3 State with reasons, which of the following pairs of terms are of like terms and which are of unlike terms: (i) 7x, 12y (i) 15x, -21x (il) 4ab, 7ba (iv) 3xy, 3x (v) 6xy, 9x y (vi) pq , 4pq (vii) mn , 10mn SOLUTION Factors Algebraic Like/ factors same | Unlike or different terms (i) 7x 7,Xx Different Unlike The variables in the 12y 12, y terms are different. (it) 15x 15, x Same Like 21x 21, x (iil) 4ab| -4,a, \ Same Like Remember 7 ba T,a,b ab = ba 2024-25 ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS ii i iii ii The variable y is only in one term. The variables in the two terms match, but their powers do not match. (vi) | pq? 1,p.9.4 Same Like Note, numerical 4pq?| 4,P. 9.4 factor 1 is not shown Following simple steps will help you to decide whether the given terms are like or unlike terms: (i) Ignore the numerical coefficients. Concentrate on the algebraic part of the terms. (ii) Check the variables in the terms. They must be the same. (iii) Next, check the powers of each variable in the terms. They must be the same. Note that in deciding like terms, two things do not matter (1) the numerical coefficients of the terms and (2) the order in which the variables are multiplied in the terms. EXERCISE 10.1 1. Get the algebraic expressions in the following cases using variables, constants and arithmetic operations. (i) Subtraction of zfrom y. (ii) One-half of the sum of numbers x and y. (ii) The number z multiplied by itself. (iv) One-fourth of the product of numbers p and q. (v) Numbers x and y both squared and added. (vi) Number 5 added to three times the product of numbers m and n. (vii) Product of numbers y and z subtracted from 10. (viii) Sum of numbers a and b subtracted from their product. 2. (i) Identify the terms and their factors in the following expressions Show the terms and factors by tree diagrams. (a) x-3 (b) l+x+x? (c) y-y? (d) 5xy?+ 7x y (e) ab+ 2b ? - 3a (ii) Identify terms and factors in
