term 5xy, 5 is the coefficient of xy, x is the coefficient of Sy Identify the coefficients of the terms of following expressions: and y is the coefficient of 5x. In 10.xy?, 10 is the coefficient of xy , x is the coefficient of 10 y? and y is the coefficient of 10x. Thus, in this more general way, a coefficient may be either a numerical factor or an algebraic factor or a product of two or more factors. It is said to be the coefficient of the 4x 3y,a+b+5,2y+5,2xy product of the remaining factors. EXAMPLE I Identify, in the following expressions, terms which are not constants. Give their numerical coefficients: xy + 4, 13 y , 13 y + 5y , 4p q 3pq + 5 2024-25 ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS ii - i SOLUTION a Constant) Coefficient (iii) 13-y+5y ~y (iv) | 4p q -3pq* +5 4p q ee EXAMPLE 2 (a) Whatare the coefficients of x in the following expressions? 4x 3y, 8- x+y, yx y, 2z- 5xz (b) Whatare the coefficients of yin the following expressions? 4x 3y, 8 + yz, yz +5, my+m SOLUTION (a) Ineach expression we look for a term with x as a factor. The remaining part of that term is the coefficient of x. (b) The method is similar to that in (a) above. Term with factor y Coefficient of y 10.4 Like AND UNLIKE TERMS When terms have the same algebraic factors, they are like terms. When terms have different algebraic factors, they are unlike terms. For example, in the expression 2xy 3x + Sxy 4, look at the terms 2xy and 5xy. The factors of 2xy are 2, x and y. The factors of 5xy are 5, xand y. Thus their algebraic (i.e., those which contain variables) factors are the same and 2024-25 EE i emarics hence they are like terms. On the other hand the BYE HESE terms 2xy and 3x, have different algebraic factors. Group the like terms together from the OR _ They are unlike terms. Similarly, the terms, 2xy following: and 4, are unlike terms. Also, the terms 3x and 4 12x, 12, 25x, 25, 25y, 1, x, 12y, y are unlike terms. 10.5 MonomIALs, BINOMIALS, TRINOMIALS AND POLYNOMIALS An expression with only one term is called a monomial; for example, 7xy, 5m, 327, 4 etc. An expression which contains two unlike terms 1s called a binomial; for example, x + y,m - 5, mn + 4m, a - b* are binomials. The expression 10pq is not a binomial; it is a Classify the following monomial. The expression (a + b + 5) is not a binomial. expressions as a monomial, It contains three terms. a binomial or a trinomial: a, a+b,ab+a+b,ab+a + b 5, xy, xy + 5, 5x -x +2, 4pq - 3q + 5p, 7,4m 7n + 10, 4mn +7. An expression which contains three terms is called a trinomial; for example, the expressions x + y+ 7, ab+a+tb, 3x 5x + 2, m+n
