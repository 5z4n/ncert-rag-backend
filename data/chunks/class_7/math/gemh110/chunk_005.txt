There are a number of situations in which we need to find the value of an expression, such as when we wish to check whether a particular value of a variable satisfies a given equation or not. We find values of expressions, also, when we use formulas from geometry and from everyday mathematics. For example, the area of a square is / , where / is the length of a side of the square. If /= 5 cm., the area is 57cm? or 25 cm ; if the side is 10 cm, the area is 10?cm? or 100 cm? and so on. We shall see more such examples in the next section. 2024-25 ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS EXAMPLE 4 Find the values of the following expressions for x= 2. (i) x+4 (i) 4x3 (iii) 19 5x2 (iv) 100 10x?
