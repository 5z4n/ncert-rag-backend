smaller than both the integers. (d) aninteger greater than only one of the integers. (e) aninteger greater than both the integers. EXAMPLE 1 Write downa pair of integers whose (a) sumis 3 (b) difference is 5 (c) difference is 2 (d) sumisO SOLUTION (a) (-l)+(2)=-3 or (5)+2=-3 (b) (-9)-C4)=5 or (-2)-3=-5 (c) (-7)-C9)=2 or 1-Cl=2 (d) (-10)+10=0 or 5+(-5)=0 Can you write more pairs in these examples? 2024-25 . Write down a pair of integers whose: . Fillin the blanks to make the following statements true: INTEGERS i EXERCISE 1.1 (a) sumis 7 (b) difference is 10 (c) sumisO . (a) Write a pair of negative integers whose difference gives 8. (b) Write a negative integer and a positive integer whose sum is 5. (c) Write anegative integer and a positive integer whose difference is 3. . Inaquiz, team A scored 40, 10,0 and team B scored 10, 0, 40 in three successive rounds. Which team scored more? Can we say that we can add integers in any order? @ (5S) + 8)=C8) t Gece ) (i) 53 4+ we. = 53 (ii) I7 +... =0 (iv) [13 +(-12)] +(e. )=13+[C-12)+ (-7)] (vy) ( 4)+ [15+ (-3)] =[-44 15] 4 oe. 1.2 MULTIPLICATION OF INTEGERS We can add and subtract integers. Let us now learn how to multiply integers. 1.2.1 Multiplication of a Positive and a Negative Integer We know that multiplication of whole numbers is repeated addition. For example, 54+54+5=3x5=15 Can you represent addition of integers in the same way? yourep S y Try THESE We have from the following number line, ( 5) + ( 5) + (-5) =-15 Find: 4x ( 8), - et = SS ES 8 x (-2), 20 15 10 5 0 3 x (-7), 10 x 1) But we can also write using number line. (-5) + (5) + (5) =3 x5) Therefore, 3 x (-5) =-15 2024-25 EE es i eMarics Similarly ( 4)+ 4)+(-4)+C 4)+@ 4)=5x (C4) =-20 _$ EEE 20 16 12 -8 4 0 And (-3) + (3) + (-3) +3) = = Also, (7) +(-1)+(-T)= = Let us see how to find the product of a positive integer and a negative integer without using number line. Let us find 3 x ( 5) in a different way. First find 3 x 5 and then put minus sign ( ) before the product obtained. You get 15. That is we find (3 x 5) to get -15. Similarly, 5 x ( 4) = (5x4) = 20. Find ina similar way, 4x(-8)=_ = X(T) = = 6x(-5)= = 2x(-9)= = Using this method we thus have, 10x (43) 0x 4) = 430 Find: Till now we multiplied integers as (positive integer) x (negative integer). eI) Let us now multiply them as (negative integer) x (positive integer). @ 12x32) We first find -3 x 5. (iit) 7 x ( 22) To find this, observe the following pattern: We have, 3x5=15 2x5=10=15-5 1x5=5=10-5 0x5=0=5-5 So, -1x5=0-5=-5 2x5=-5-5=-10 3x5=-10-5=-15 We already have 3
