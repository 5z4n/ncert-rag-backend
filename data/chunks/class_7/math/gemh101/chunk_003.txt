way, 4x(-8)=_ = X(T) = = 6x(-5)= = 2x(-9)= = Using this method we thus have, 10x (43) 0x 4) = 430 Find: Till now we multiplied integers as (positive integer) x (negative integer). eI) Let us now multiply them as (negative integer) x (positive integer). @ 12x32) We first find -3 x 5. (iit) 7 x ( 22) To find this, observe the following pattern: We have, 3x5=15 2x5=10=15-5 1x5=5=10-5 0x5=0=5-5 So, -1x5=0-5=-5 2x5=-5-5=-10 3x5=-10-5=-15 We already have 3 x (-5) =-15 So we get (-3) x 5 =-15 =3 x (-5) Using such patterns, we also get ( 5) x 4= 20 =5 x ( 4) Using patterns, find ( 4) x 8, ( 3) x 7, (- 6) x 5 and ( 2) x9 Check whether, ( 4) x 8=4 x ( 8), (-3) x 7=3 x (-7), (-6) x 5 =6x ( 5) 2024-25 INTEGERS and (-2)x9=2~x(-9) Using this we get, ( 33) x 5 = 33 x (-5) =-165 We thus find that while multiplying a positive integer and a negative integer, we multiply them as whole numbers and put a minus sign ( ) before the product. We thus get a negative integer. 1. Find: (a) 15 x(-16) (b) 21 x(-32) (c) ( 42)x 12 (d) -55 x 15 2. Checkif (a) 25 x (-21)=(-25)x21 = (b) (-23) x 20=23 x (20) Write five more such examples. In general, for any two positive integers a and b we can say ax ( b) =(-a) x b=-(axb) 1.2.2 Multiplication of two Negative Integers Can you find the product ( 3) x ( 2)? Observe the following: -3x4=-12 -3 x3 =-9 =-12-(-3) 3 x2 =-6=-9-(-3) 3x | =-3 = 6-(-3) -3x0=0 =-3-(-3) 3 x-1=0-(-3)=04+3=3 3 x -2=3-(-3)=34+3=6 Do you see any pattern? Observe how the products change. Based on this observation, complete the following: 3x3= 3x-4=_ Now observe these products and fill in the blanks: -4x4=-16 -4x3=-12 =-16+4 -4x2=_ = -124+4 2024-25 EE Ee i emarics -4x1l= ~4x0= -4x (-I)=___ (i) Starting from (5) x 4, find (-5) x (-6) -4x(-2)=__ Gi) Starting from ( 6) x 3, find ( 6) x (7) 4x (3)=____ From these patterns we observe that, (-3) x (-l)=3 =3x1 (-3) x (-2)=6=3x2 (-3) x (-3)=9=3 x3 and ( 4)x(-l)=4=4x1 So, (-4)x(-2)=4x2 =__ (-4)x(3)=_ = So observing these products we can say that the product of two negative integers is a positive integer. We multiply the two negative integers as whole numbers and put the positive sign before the product. Thus, we have (-10) x (-12) = + 120 = 120 Similarly ( 15) x (-6) = + 90 = 90 In general, for any two positive integers a and b, (-a)x( b)=axb Find: ( 31) x ( 100), ( 25) x ( 72), (-83) x ( 28) Game 1 (i) Take a board marked from 104 to 104 as shown in the figure. (i) Take a bag containing two blue and two red dice. Number of dots on the blue
