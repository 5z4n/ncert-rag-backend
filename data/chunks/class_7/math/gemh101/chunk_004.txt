we have (-10) x (-12) = + 120 = 120 Similarly ( 15) x (-6) = + 90 = 90 In general, for any two positive integers a and b, (-a)x( b)=axb Find: ( 31) x ( 100), ( 25) x ( 72), (-83) x ( 28) Game 1 (i) Take a board marked from 104 to 104 as shown in the figure. (i) Take a bag containing two blue and two red dice. Number of dots on the blue dice indicate positive integers and number of dots on the red dice indicate negative integers. (iit) Every player will place his/her counter at zero. (tv) Each player will take out two dice at a time from the bag and throw them. (v) After every throw, the player has to multiply the numbers marked on the dice. 2024-25 INTEGERS i Sn N cn F/G |< ly} | AN}t]/ st st} W| | 0 1} ty va) a ae) wit) tS | Nom Kee) | tI N all =) vai Big WY | | | =92[ -91 |-90 | 89 |-88| 87] -86| ~85] s4| 83) =95 | 96-97 [98 | -99| = 100] 101 | -102 | -103] 104 (vi) Ifthe product is a positive integer then the player will move his counter towards [13 | 74-75 [-76 | =r7] 78] 79] 20| si] -82_ zr 104; if the product is a negative integer then the player will move his counter towards 104.

Observe the following table and complete it: What do you observe? Can you find a pair of integers whose product is not an integer? No. This gives us an idea that the product of two integers is again an integer. So we can say that integers are closed under multiplication. In general, ax bisan integer, for all integers a and b. Find the product of five more pairs of integers and verify the above statement. 1.3.2 Commutativity of Multiplication We know that multiplication is commutative for whole numbers. Can we say, multiplication is also commutative for integers? Observe the following table and complete it: Statement 1 Statement 2 3 x ( 4) =-12 (-4) x3 =-12 3x (-4) =(-4) x3 (-15) x (-10) = 150 (-10) x (-15) = 150 (-35) x (-12) = (-12) x (-35) = (-1) x (-15) = 2024-25 INTEGERS i What are your observations? The above examples suggest multiplication is commutative for integers. Write five more such examples and verify. In general, for any two integers a and b, axb=bxa 1.3.3 Multiplication by Zero We know that any whole number when multiplied by zero gives zero. Observe the following products of negative integers and zero. These are obtained from the patterns done earlier. (-3) x0=0 0x (-4)=0 -5x0=__ 0x (-6)=___ This shows that the product of a negative integer and zero is zero. In general,
