and b. Multiplication is commutative for integers. That is, ax b=b xa for any integers aand b. The integer | is the identity under multiplication, 1.e., 1 x a=ax 1 =a for any integer a. Multiplication is associative for integers, 1.e., (a x b) x c=ax (bx c) for any three integers a, b and c. . Under addition and multiplication, integers show a property called distributive property. That is, ax (b+c)=axb+axc for any three integers a, b and c. . The properties of commutativity, associativity under addition and multiplication, and the distributive property help us to make our calculations easier. . Wealso learnt how to divide integers. We found that, (a) (b) When a positive integer is divided by a negative integer, the quotient obtained is negative and vice-versa. Division of a negative integer by another negative integer gives positive as quotient. . Forany integer a, we have (a) a~0is not defined (b) a+lz=a -25
