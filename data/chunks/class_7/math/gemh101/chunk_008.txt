as whole numbers and then put a positive sign (+). In general, for any two positive integers a and b (-a) + (-b)=a~ b where b# 0 Find: (a) (36) = (4) (b) (201) = (3) (c) (-325) + (-13) be 1.5 PROPERTIES OF DIVISION OF INTEGERS z Observe the following table and complete it: ww What do you observe? We observe that integers are not closed under division. (-8)+(-4) =2 Result is an integer _4 (-4)+(C 8)= Result is not an integer} 3 ~ (-8)= 2024-25 EE, i ematics Justify it by taking five more examples of your own. @ We know that division is not commutative for whole numbers. Let us check it for integers also. You can see from the table that ( 8) + (-4) # (-4) + 8). Is (-9) + 3 the same as 3 + (9)? Is ( 30) + (6) the same as ( 6) + ( 30)? Can we say that division is commutative for integers? No. You can verify it by taking five more pairs of integers. Like whole numbers, any integer divided by zero is meaningless and zero divided by an integer other than zero is equal to zero i.e., for any integer a, a + Ois not defined but0 +a=0 fora #0. When we divide a whole number by | it gives the same whole number. Let us check whether it is true for negative integers also. Observe the following : ( 8)+1=(C8) (-11l)+1=-11 (-13) +1 =-13 (-25)+1l=___ (-37) +1 =___ ( 48)+1=___ This shows that negative integer divided by 1 gives the same negative integer. So, any integer divided by I gives the same integer. In general, for any integer a, a+l=a What happens when we divide any integer by (1)? Complete the following table (-8)+C1)=8 11+(-1)=-l1 13+(-1l)=_ (25)+(CD=_ 37) #1) = __ 48+ (-1)=___ What do you observe? We can say that if any integer is divided by ( 1) it does not give the same integer. Can we say [( 16) + 4] + ( 2) is the same as ( 16) + [4 + (-2)]? We know that [(-16) + 4] = (-2) =(-4) + 2) =2 Md. aA (i) a+(-1)=- a? for any integer a. So [( 16) + 4] + (-2) #(-16) + [4+ (2)] Can you say that division is associative for integers? No. Take different values of aandcheck. Verify it by taking five more examples of your own. 2024-25 INTEGERS EXAMPLE 2 Inatest (+5) marks are given for every correct answer and ( 2) marks are given for every incorrect answer. (i) Radhika answered all the questions and scored 30 marks though she got 10 correct answers. (ii) Jay also answered all the questions and scored ( 12) marks though he got 4 correct answers. How many incorrect answers had they attempted? SOLUTION (i) Marks given for one correct answer = 5 So, marks given for 10 correct answers = 5 x 10 =50 Radhika s score = 30 Marks
