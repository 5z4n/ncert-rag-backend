the sums are different when the order is changed? Certainly not. We say that addition is commutative for integers. 2024-25 INTEGERS i In general, for any two integers a and b, we can say at+b=b+a @ We know that subtraction is not commutative for whole numbers. Is it commutative for integers? Consider the integers 5 and ( 3). Is 5 (3) the same as ( 3) -5? No, because 5 (-3) =5 +3 = 8, and (-3) 5 =-3-5=-8. Take atleast five different pairs of integers and check this. We conclude that subtraction is not commutative for integers. 1.1.4 Associative Property Observe the following examples: Consider the integers 3, 2 and 5. Look at ( 5) + [(-3) + (-2)] and [( 5) + (-3)] + (2). In the first sum ( 3) and ( 2) are grouped together and in the second ( 5) and ( 3) are grouped together. We will check whether we get different results. (3) +2) (2) (5) +) 10 5 0 -10 -8 0 (-5) + [(-3) + (-2)] [(-5) + (-3)] + 2) In both the cases, we get 10. ie., (-5) + [-3) + @2)] = [(-5) + -2)] + C3) Similarly consider 3 , | and 7. (-3)+ [1+ (-7)]=-3 + = [((-3) + 1] + (<7) =-2 + = Is (-3) + [1 + (-7)] same as [(-3) + 1] + (-7)? Take five more such examples. You will not find any example for which the sums are different. Addition is associative for integers. In general for any integers a, b andc, we can say at+(b+c)=(at+b)+c 2024-25 EE Ss emarics 1. Write a pair of integers whose sum gives 1.1.5 Additive Identity When we add zero to any whole number, we get the same whole number. Zero is an additive identity for whole numbers. Is it an additive identity again for integers also? Observe the following and fill in the blanks: (i) (-8)+0 =-8 (i) O+( 8)=-8 (i) (-23)+0=_ (iv) 0+ (-37) =-37 (v) 0+(-59)=_ (vii) O+_ = - 43 (vi) 61+ =-61 (viii) +0= The above examples show that zero is an additive identity for integers. You can verify it by adding zero to any other five integers. In general, for any integer a a+O=a=O0+a (a) anegative integer (b) zero (c) aninteger smaller than both the integers. (d) aninteger smaller than only one of the integers. (e) aninteger greater than both the integers. . Write a pair of integers whose difference gives (a) anegative integer. (b) zero. (c) aninteger smaller than both the integers. (d) aninteger greater than only one of the integers. (e) aninteger greater than both the integers. EXAMPLE 1 Write downa pair of integers whose (a) sumis 3 (b) difference is 5 (c) difference is 2 (d) sumisO SOLUTION (a) (-l)+(2)=-3 or (5)+2=-3 (b) (-9)-C4)=5 or (-2)-3=-5 (c) (-7)-C9)=2 or 1-Cl=2 (d) (-10)+10=0 or 5+(-5)=0 Can you write more pairs in these examples? 2024-25 .
