above examples suggest multiplication is commutative for integers. Write five more such examples and verify. In general, for any two integers a and b, axb=bxa 1.3.3 Multiplication by Zero We know that any whole number when multiplied by zero gives zero. Observe the following products of negative integers and zero. These are obtained from the patterns done earlier. (-3) x0=0 0x (-4)=0 -5x0=__ 0x (-6)=___ This shows that the product of a negative integer and zero is zero. In general, for any integer a, ax0=0xa=0 1.3.4 Multiplicative Identity We know that | is the multiplicative identity for whole numbers. Check that 1 is the multiplicative identity for integers as well. Observe the following products of integers with 1. (-3)x1=-3 1x5=5 (-4)x1l=__ Ix8=_ Ix(5)=_ 3x1=___ 1x(-6)=___ Tx1l=_ This shows that 1 is the multiplicative identity for integers also. In general, for any integer a we have, axl=1xa=a What happens when we multiply any integer with 1? Complete the following: (-3) x (1) =3 3 x (-1) =-3 0 is the additive identity whereas 1 is the (6) x Cl) = ___ multiplicative identity for integers. We get (-1) x 13 =___ additive inverse of an integer a when we multiply (-1) x (-25)= (-1) toa,ie. ax (-l1)=(-1) Xa=-a 18 x (-1)= What do you observe? Can we say 1 is a multiplicative identity of integers? No. 2024-25 EE, i emarics 1.3.5 Associativity for Multiplication Consider 3, 2 and 5. Look at [( 3) x (-2)] x 5 and ( 3) x [(-2) x 5]. In the first case ( 3) and ( 2) are grouped together and in the second ( 2) and 5 are grouped together. We see that [(-3) x (-2)] x 5=6x5=30 and (-3) x [( 2) x 5] = (-3) x (-10) = 30 oF So, we get the same answer in both the cases. * Thus, [(-3) x (-2)] x 5=(-3) x [(-2) x 5] Look at this and complete the products: [(7) x (-6)] x4= x4= 7x [(-6) x4] =7x = Is [7 x (-6)] x 4=7 x [( 6) x 4]? Does the grouping of integers affect the product of integers? No. In general, for any three integers a, b andc (ax b)xc=ax(bxc) Take any five values for a, b and c each and verify this property. Thus, like whole numbers, the product of three integers does not depend upon the grouping of integers and this is called the associative property for multiplication of integers. 1.3.6 Distributive Property We know 16 x (10+ 2) = (16 x 10) + (16 x 2) [Distributivity of multiplication over addition] Let us check if this is true for integers also. Observe the following: (a) (-2) x (3+5)=-2x8=-16 and = [( 2) x 3] + [(-2) x 5] = (- 6) + (10) =-16 So, (-2) x (3. +5) =[(-2) x 3] + [(-2) x 5] (b) ( 4) x [(-2) + 7] = ( 4) x 5 =-20 and = [( 4) x (-2)]+[(-4) x 7]= 8
