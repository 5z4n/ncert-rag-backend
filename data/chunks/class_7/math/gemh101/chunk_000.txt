Chapter 1 Integers ira 1.1 PROPERTIES OF ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION OF INTEGERS We have learnt about whole numbers and integers in Class VI. We have also learnt about addition and subtraction of integers. 1.1.1 Closure under Addition We have learnt that sum of two whole numbers is again a whole number. For example, 17 +24=41 which is again a whole number. We know that, this property is known as the closure property for addition of the whole numbers. Let us see whether this property is true for integers or not. Following are some pairs of integers. Observe the following table and complete it. Statement Observation @) 17+23=40 Result is an integer @i) (-10)+3=___ (ii) ( 75)+18=_ (iv) 19+( 25) =-6 Result is an integer (v) 27+(-27)=__ (vi) ( 20)+0=_ (vil) (~ 35) +( 10) =___ What do you observe? Is the sum of two integers always an integer? Did you find a pair of integers whose sum is not an integer? Since addition of integers gives integers, we say integers are closed under addition. In general, for any two integers a and b, a + b is an integer. 2024-25 EE ee sr emarics 1.1.2 Closure under Subtraction What happens when we subtract an integer from another integer? Can we say that their difference is also an integer? Observe the following table and complete it: Statement Observation Gi) 7-9=-2 Result is an integer @) 17 (-21)=__ OO (ii) (- 8) -(-14) =6 Result is an integer (iv) ( 21)-(- 10) =___ (v) 32-(-17)= (vi) ( 18)-( 18) =__ (vil) ( 29)-O=____ What do you observe? Is there any pair of integers whose difference is not an integer? Can we Say integers are closed under subtraction? Yes, we can see that integers are closed under subtraction. Thus, ifa and b are two integers then a- b is also an intger. Do the whole numbers satisfy this property? 1.1.3 Commutative Property We know that 3 +5 =5 +3 =8, that is, the whole numbers can be added in any order. In other words, addition is commutative for whole numbers. Can we say the same for integers also? We have 5 + ( 6) = 1 and (-6)+5=-1 So, 5+ ( 6) =( 6)+5 Are the following equal? (i) ( 8) +( 9) and ( 9) + (- 8) (ii) ( 23) +32 and 32 + ( 23) (ii) ( 45)+0 and 0 + ( 45) Try this with five other pairs of integers. Do you find any pair of integers for which the sums are different when the order is changed? Certainly not. We say that addition is commutative for integers. 2024-25 INTEGERS i In general, for any two integers a and b, we can say at+b=b+a @ We know that subtraction is not commutative for whole numbers. Is it commutative for integers? Consider the integers 5 and ( 3). Is 5 (3) the same as ( 3) -5? No, because 5 (-3) =5 +3 = 8, and (-3) 5 =-3-5=-8. Take
