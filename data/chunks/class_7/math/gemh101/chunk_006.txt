= (16 x 10) + (16 x 2) [Distributivity of multiplication over addition] Let us check if this is true for integers also. Observe the following: (a) (-2) x (3+5)=-2x8=-16 and = [( 2) x 3] + [(-2) x 5] = (- 6) + (10) =-16 So, (-2) x (3. +5) =[(-2) x 3] + [(-2) x 5] (b) ( 4) x [(-2) + 7] = ( 4) x 5 =-20 and = [( 4) x (-2)]+[(-4) x 7]= 8 +(-28) =-20 So, ( 4) x [(-2) +7] =[C 4) x -2)] + 1-4) x 7] (c) (~8) x [(-2) + (-D] = (- 8) x (3) = 24 and = [( 8) x (-2)] + [- 8) x (-l] = 16 +8 =24 So, ( 8) x [(-2) +(-]I)] =[- 8) x (-2)] +[C 8) x CD] 2024-25 INTEGERS i Can we say that the distributivity of multiplication over addition is true for integers also? Yes. In general, for any integers a, b and c, ax(b+c)=axb+axc Take atleast five different values for each of a, b and c and verify the above Distributive property. en) (i) Is 10 x [((6+ (-2)] = 10x 6+ 10x (-2)? (i) Is ( 15) x [((-7) + (-1)] = 15) x (-7) + 15) x (-1)? Now consider the following: Can we say 4 x (3-8) =4x3-4~x 8? Let us check: 4x (3-8) =4x (-5) =-20 4x3-4x8=12 -32=-20 So, 4x(3-8)=4x3-4.x8. Look at the following: (-5) x [(-4) (-6)] =(-S) x2 = -10 [(-5) x ( 4)] -[(-5) x (- 6)] =20 -30= -10 So, (-5)x[(-4) (-6)] =[(-5) x (-4)] -[(-5) x (-9)] Check this for ( 9) x [ 10 ( 3)] and [(-9) x 10 ] [ (-9) x (-3)] You will find that these are also equal. In general, for any three integers a, b and c, ax(b-c)=axb-axc Take atleast five different values for each of a, b and c and verify this property.
