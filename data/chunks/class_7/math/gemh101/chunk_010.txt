Write five pairs of integers (a, b) such that a+b = 3. One such pair is (6, 2) because 6 + ( 2) = ( 3). . The temperature at 12 noon was 10 C above zero. If it decreases at the rate of 2 C per hour until midnight, at what time would the temperature be 8 C below zero? What would be the temperature at mid-night? . Inaclass test (+ 3) marks are given for every correct answer and ( 2) marks are given for every incorrect answer and no marks for not attempting any question. (i) Radhika scored 20 marks. If she has got 12 correct answers, how many questions has she attempted incorrectly? (11) Mohini scores 5 marks in this test, though she has got 7 correct answers. How many questions has she attempted incorrectly? . Anelevator descends into a mine shaft at the rate of 6 m/min. If the descent starts from 10 m above the ground level, how long will it take to reach 350 m. 2024-25 INTEGERS iE WHuaT HAVE WE DISCUSSED? . Wenow study the properties satisfied by addition and subtraction. (a) (b) (c) (d) Integers are closed for addition and subtraction both. That is, a + b and a- bare again integers, where a and bare any integers. Addition is commutative for integers, i.e, a+ b=b +a for all integers aand b. Addition is associative for integers, i.e., (a +b)+c=a+(b+c) for all integers a, band c. Integer 0 is the identity under addition. That is, a+0=0+a=a for every integer a. . Westudied, how integers could be multiplied, and found that product of a positive and a negative integer is a negative integer, whereas the product of two negative integers is a positive integer. For example, 2 x 7= 14 and 3 x 8 =24. . Product of even number of negative integers is positive, whereas the product of odd number of negative integers is negative. . Integers show some properties under multiplication. (a) (b) (c) (d) Integers are closed under multiplication. That is, a x b is an integer for any two integers a and b. Multiplication is commutative for integers. That is, ax b=b xa for any integers aand b. The integer | is the identity under multiplication, 1.e., 1 x a=ax 1 =a for any integer a. Multiplication is associative for integers, 1.e., (a x b) x c=ax (bx c) for any three integers a, b and c. . Under addition and multiplication, integers show a property called distributive property. That is, ax (b+c)=axb+axc for any three integers a, b and c.
