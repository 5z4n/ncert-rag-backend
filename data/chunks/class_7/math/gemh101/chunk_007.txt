18 x [7 + (-3)] = [18 x 7] + [18 x -3)] (21) x[-4) +6) =1-2) x C4] +(-2) x (-6)] 3. (i) Forany integer a, what is ( 1) x a equal to? (ii) Determine the integer whose product with ( 1) is (a) -22 (b) 37 (c) O 4. Starting from ( 1) x 5, write various products showing some pattern to show (-1) x (-l)=1. 1.4 Drvision oF INTEGERS We know that division is the inverse operation of multiplication. Let us see an example for whole numbers. Since 3 x 5=15 So 15+5=3and15+3=5 Similarly, 4 x 3 = 12 gives 12 +4=3 and 12+3=4 We can say for each multiplication statement of whole numbers there are two division statements. Can you write multiplication statement and its corresponding divison statements for integers? @ Observe the following and complete it. Multiplication Statement 2 x ( 6) = (-12) (-12) + ( 6) =2 , (-12)+2=(-6) ( 4) x 5 = (20) (-20) +5 = (- 4) (20)+(--4=5 ( 8) x (-9) = 72 72+ = yO (-3) x (-7) = (-8)x4=_ 5 x (-9) = (-10) x (-5) = 2024-25 INTEGERS i (-12) +2 =(-6) Find: (-20) * 5S=(-4) (a) (-100)+5 = (b) (81) +9 (32) =4=(- 8) ( ) (75)=5 @) (32)+2 (- 45) +5 =(-9) We observe that when we divide a negative integer by a positive integer, we divide them as whole numbers and then put a minus sign ( ) before the quotient. @ We also observe that: Can we say that 72 + (-8)=-9 and 50+ (-10)=-5 ( 48) = 8 = 48 ( 8)? 72 + (-9)=-8 50 + (-5)=-10 Let us check. We know that 48)+8=-6 So we can say that when we divide a positive integer by a negative Cc . a . and 48 +( 8)=-6 integer, we first divide them as whole numbers and then put a minus . . So ( 48) + 8 = 48 + ( 8) sign ( ) before the quotient. wee Check this for In general, for any two positive integers a and b (). 90 = (45) and (90) = 45 a~ (-b)=(-a)= b where b # 0 (ii) (-136) +4 and 136 + ( 4) Find: (a) 125+(-25) (b)80+(-5) (c)64+(-16) @ Lastly, we observe that (-12) + ( 6) =2;(-20) + ( 4) =5; (-32) + (-8)=4; (- 45) + --9)=5 So, we can say that when we divide a negative integer by a negative integer, we first divide them as whole numbers and then put a positive sign (+). In general, for any two positive integers a and b (-a) + (-b)=a~ b where b# 0 Find: (a) (36) = (4) (b) (201) = (3) (c) (-325) + (-13) be 1.5 PROPERTIES OF DIVISION OF INTEGERS z Observe the following table and complete it: ww What do you observe? We observe that integers are not closed under division. (-8)+(-4) =2 Result is an integer _4 (-4)+(C 8)= Result is
