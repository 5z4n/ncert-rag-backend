2013, 2540, 2820 Find the mean enrolment of the school for this period. 8. The rainfall _ in acity on 7 days of a certain week was recorded as follows: on [Tue [Wel [Thus [ FH | Sat | Sm an 122] 21 205} 5.5 | 1.0 (inmm) (i) Find the range of the rainfall in the above data. (ii) Find the mean rainfall for the week. (ii) On how many days was the rainfall less than the mean rainfall. 9. The heights of 10 girls were measured in cm and the results are as follows: 135, 150, 139, 128, 151, 132, 146, 149, 143, 141. (i) Whatis the height of the tallest girl? (1) Whatis the height of the shortest girl? (ii) What is the range of the data? (iv) What is the mean height of the girls? (v) How many girls have heights more than the mean height. 3.3 Mone As we have said Mean is not the only measure of central tendency or the only form of representative value. For different requirements from a data, other measures of central tendencies are used. Look at the following example To find out the weekly demand for different sizes of shirt, a shopkeeper kept records of sales of sizes 90 cm, 95 cm, 100 cm, 105 cm, 110 cm. Following is the record for a week: If he found the mean number of shirts sold, do you think that he would be able to decide which shirt sizes to keep in stock? M F total sh; id Total number of shirts sold 105 | 1 ean of total shirts sold = Number of different sizes of shirts 5 Should he obtain 21 shirts of each size? If he does so, will he be able to cater to the needs of the customers? 2024-25 DATA HANDLING iii The shopkeeper, on looking at the record, decides to procure shirts of sizes 95 cm, 100 cm, 105 cm. He decided to postpone the procurement of the shirts of other sizes because of their small number of buyers. Look at another example The owner of a readymade dress shop says, The most popular size of dress I sell is the size 90 cm. Observe that here also, the owner is concerned about the number of shirts of different sizes sold. She is however looking at the shirt size that is sold the most. This is another representative value for the data. The highest occuring event is the sale of size 90 cm. This representative value is called the mode of the data. The mode of a set of observations is the observation that occurs most often. EXAMPLE 4 Find the mode of the given set of numbers: 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 2, 1,2, 2,4 SOLUTION Arranging the numbers with same values together, we get 1,1, 1, 2,2, 2,2, 3,4,4 Mode of this data is 2 because it occurs more frequently than other observations. 3.3.1 Mode of Large Data Putting the same observations together
