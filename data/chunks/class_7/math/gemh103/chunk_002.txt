idea of the spread of the observations. This can be found by subtracting the lowest observation from the highest observation. We call the result the range of the observation. Look at the following example: EXAMPLE 3 The ages in years of 10 teachers of a school are: 32, 41, 28, 54, 35, 26, 23, 33, 38, 40 (i) What is the age of the oldest teacher and that of the youngest teacher? (ii) What is the range of the ages of the teachers? (ii) What is the mean age of these teachers? SOLUTION (i) Arranging the ages in ascending order, we get: 23, 26, 28, 32, 33, 35, 38, 40, 41, 54 We find that the age of the oldest teacher is 54 years and the age of the youngest teacher is 23 years. 2024-25 DATA HANDLING (ii) Range of the ages of the teachers = (54 23) years = 31 years (ii) Mean age of the teachers 4. Acricketer scores the following runs in eight innings: 234204 28432 33439 4384404 44 ~ 10 ears = 710 y' = 35 years EXERCISE 3.1 . Find the range of heights of any ten students of your class. . Organise the following marks in a class assessment, in a tabular form. 4, 6, 7,5, 3,5, 4,5, 2, 6, 2,5, 1, 9, 6, 5, 8, 4, 6, 7 (i) Whichnumber is the highest? (ii) Which number is the lowest? (ii) What is the range of the data? (iv) Find the arithmetic mean. . Find the mean of the first five whole numbers. 58, 76, 40, 35, 46, 45, 0, 100. Find the mean score. . Following table shows the points of each player scored in four games: Now answer the following questions: (i) Find the mean to determine A s average number of points scored per game. (i) To find the mean number of points per game for C, would you divide the total points by 3 or by 4? Why? (ii) B played in all the four games. How would you find the mean? (iv) Whois the best performer? . The marks (out of 100) obtained by a group of students in a science test are 85, 76, 90, 85, 39, 48, 56, 95, 81 and 75. Find the: (i) Highest and the lowest marks obtained by the students. 2024-25 EE a i emarics (ii) Range of the marks obtained. (ii) Mean marks obtained by the group. 7. The enrolment ina school during six consecutive years was as follows: 1555, 1670, 1750, 2013, 2540, 2820 Find the mean enrolment of the school for this period. 8. The rainfall _ in acity on 7 days of a certain week was recorded as follows: on [Tue [Wel [Thus [ FH | Sat | Sm an 122] 21 205} 5.5 | 1.0 (inmm) (i) Find the range of the rainfall in the above data. (ii) Find the mean rainfall for the week. (ii) On how many days was the rainfall less than the mean rainfall.
