What do we understand by mode here? Whereas mean gives us the average of all observations of the data, the mode gives that observation which occurs most frequently in the data. Let us consider the following examples: (a) You have to decide upon the number of chapattis needed for 25 people called for a feast. (b) Ashopkeeper selling shirts has decided to replenish her stock. (c) Weneed to find the height of the door needed in our house. (d) When going ona picnic, if only one fruit can be bought for everyone, which is the fruit that we would get. In which of these situations can we use the mode as a good estimate? Consider the first statement. Suppose the number of chapattis needed by each person is 2,3,2,3,2,1,2,3,2,2,4, 2, 2,3, 2,4, 4, 2,3, 2,4, 2,4, 3,5 2024-25 DATA HANDLING iy The mode of the data is 2 chapattis. If we use mode as the representative value for this data, then we need 50 chapattis only, 2 for each of the 25 persons. However the total number would clearly be inadequate. Would mean be an appropriate representative value? For the third statement the height of the door is related to the height of the persons using that door. Suppose there are 5 children and 4 adults using the door and the height of each of 5 children is around 135 cm. The mode for the heights is 135 cm. Should we get a door thatis 144 cm high? Would all the adults be able to go through that door? It is clear that mode is not the appropriate representative value for this data. Would mean be an appropriate representative value here? Why not? Which representative value of height should be used to decide the doorheight? Similarly analyse the rest of the statements and find the representative value useful for that issue. Try THESE Discuss with your friends and give (a) Two situations where mean would be an appropriate representative value to use, and (b) Two situations where mode would be an appropriate representative value to use. 3.4 MEDIAN We have seen that in some situations, arithmetic mean is an appropriate measure of central tendency whereas in some other situations, mode is the appropriate measure of central tendency. Let us now look at another example. Consider a group of 17 students with the following heights (in cm): 106, 110, 123, 125, 117, 120, 112, 115, 110, 120, 115, 102, 115, 115, 109, 115, 101. The games teacher wants to divide the class into two groups so that each group has equal number of students, one group has students with height lesser than a particular height and the other group has students with heights greater than the particular height. How would she do that? Let us see the various options she has: (i) She can find the mean. The mean is 106+110+123+1254+1174+1204+112+115+110+120+1154+1024+115+115+109+115+101 1930 113.5 2024-25 EE ee sr emarics So, if the teacher divides the students into two groups on the basis
