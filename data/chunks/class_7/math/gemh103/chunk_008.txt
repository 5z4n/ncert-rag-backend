observations. Consider the following examples: EXAMPLE 8Two hundred students of 6" and 7" classes were asked to name their favourite colour so as to decide upon what should be the colour of their school building. The results are shown in the following table. Represent the given data on a bar graph. Answer the following questions with the help of the bar graph: (i) Which is the most preferred colour and which is the least preferred? (it) How many colours are there in all? What are they? SOLUTION Choose asuitable scale as follows: Start the scale at 0. The greatest value in the data is 55, so end the scale at a value greater than 55, such as 60. Use equal divisions along the axes, such as increments of 10. You 2024-25 EE emarics Scale : 1 unit = 10 students Students > 50 30 10 ue] G} [a4 Green Blue Yellow Orange know that all the bars would lie between 0 and 60. We choose the scale such that the length between 0 and 60 is neither too long nor too small. Here we take | unit for 10 students. We then draw and label the graph as shown. From the bar graph we conclude that (i) Blue is the most preferred colour (Because the bar representing Blue is the tallest). (ii) Green is the least preferred colour. (Because the bar representing Green is the shortest). (ii) There are five colours. They are Red, Green, Blue, Yellow and Orange. (These are observed on the horizontal line) EXAMPLE 9 Following data gives total marks (out of 600) obtained by six children of a particular class. Represent the data on a bar graph.

Thus 1| unit will represent 100 marks. (What would be the difficulty if we choose one unit to represent 10 marks?) (ii) Now represent the data on the bar graph.

These cities are near the south pole and hence have only a few hours of sunshine each day. In Margate 1 3 1 1 2 | 4 4 a | 7 4 In Aberdeen By drawing individual bar graphs you could answer questions like (i) In which month does each city has maximum sunlight? or (ii) In which months does each city has minimum sunlight? G & However, to answer questions like In a particular month, which city has more sunshine eae hours , we need to compare the average hours of sunshine of both the cities.
