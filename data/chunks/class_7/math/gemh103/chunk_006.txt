class into two groups so that each group has equal number of students, one group has students with height lesser than a particular height and the other group has students with heights greater than the particular height. How would she do that? Let us see the various options she has: (i) She can find the mean. The mean is 106+110+123+1254+1174+1204+112+115+110+120+1154+1024+115+115+109+115+101 1930 113.5 2024-25 EE ee sr emarics So, if the teacher divides the students into two groups on the basis of this mean height, such that one group has students of height less than the mean height and the other group has students with height more than the mean height, then the groups would be of unequal size. They would have 7 and 10 members respectively. (ii) The second option for her is to find mode. The observation with highest frequency is 115 cm, which would be taken as mode. There are 7 children below the mode and 10 children at the mode and above the mode. Therefore, we cannot divide the group into equal parts. Let us therefore think of an alternative representative value or measure of central tendency. For doing this we again look at the given heights (in cm) of students and arrange them in ascending order. We have the following observations: 101, 102, 106, 109, 110, 110, 112, 115, 115, 115, 115, 115, 117, 120, 120, 123, 125 The middle value in this data is 115 because this value Try THESE divides the students into two equal groups of 8 students each. This value is called as Median. Median refers to the value Your friend found the median and the mode of a given data. Describe and correct your friends error if any: which lies in the middle of the data (when arranged in an increasing or decreasing order) with half of the observations above it and the other half below it. The games teacher decides 35, 32, 35, 42, 38, 32, 34 to keep the middle student as a refree in the game. Median = 42, Mode = 32 Here, we consider only those cases where number of observations is odd. Thus, in a given data, arranged in ascending or descending order, the median gives us the middle observation. Note that in general, we may not get the same value for median and mode. Thus we realise that mean, mode and median are the numbers that are the representative values of a group of observations or data. They lie between the minimum and maximum values of the data. They are also called the measures of the central tendency. EXAMPLE 7 Find the median of the data: 24, 36, 46, 17, 18, 25, 35 SOLUTION Wearrange the data in ascending order, we get 17, 18, 24, 25, 35, 36, 46 Median is the middle observation. Therefore 25 is the median. EXERCISE 3.2 1. The scores in mathematics test (out of 25) of 15 students is as follows: 19, 25, 23, 20, 9, 20, 15, 10, 5,
