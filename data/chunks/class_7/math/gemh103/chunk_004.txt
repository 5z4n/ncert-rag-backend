value is called the mode of the data. The mode of a set of observations is the observation that occurs most often. EXAMPLE 4 Find the mode of the given set of numbers: 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 2, 1,2, 2,4 SOLUTION Arranging the numbers with same values together, we get 1,1, 1, 2,2, 2,2, 3,4,4 Mode of this data is 2 because it occurs more frequently than other observations. 3.3.1 Mode of Large Data Putting the same observations together and counting them is not easy if the number of observations is large. In such cases we tabulate the data. Tabulation can begin by putting tally marks and finding the frequency, as you did in your previous class. Look at the following example: EXAmMPLe 5 Following are the margins of victory in the football Find the mode of matches of a league. ; 1,3,2,5, 1,4, 6, 2,5, 2,2, 2,4, 1, 2,3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, @ . . 93,0, 3,4, 3,2,4,9, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 5, 3, 3, 2,3, 2,4, 2, 1,2 Find the mode of this data. (i) 2, 14, 16, 12, 14, 14, 16, SOLUTION Letus put the data ina tabular form: 14, 10, 14, 18, 14 Margins of Victory Tally Bars Number of Matches TH III! TH TH III! 2024-25 EE st emarics Looking at the table, we can quickly say that 2 is the mode since 2 has occured the highest number of times. Thus, most of the matches have been won with a victory margin of 2 goals. TuHink, Discuss AND WRITE Can a set of numbers have more than one mode? EXAMPLE 6Find the mode of the numbers: 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5,5, 5, 6, 6, 8 SOLUTION Here, 2 and 5 both occur three times. Therefore, they both are modes of the data. 1. Record the age in years of all your classmates. Tabulate the data and find the mode. 2. Record the heights in centimetres of your classmates and find the mode. 1. Find the mode of the following data: 12, 14, 12, 16, 15, 13, 14, 18, 19, 12, 14, 15, 16, 15, 16, 16, 15, 17, 13, 16, 16, 15, 15, 13, 15, 17, 15, 14, 15, 13, 15, 14 2. Heights (in cm) of 25 children are given below: 168, 165, 163, 160, 163, 161, 162, 164, 163, 162, 164, 163, 160, 163, 160, 165, 163, 162, 163, 164, 163, 160, 165, 163, 162 What is the mode of their heights? What do we understand by mode here? Whereas mean gives us the average of all observations of the data, the mode gives that observation which occurs most frequently in the data. Let us consider the following examples: (a) You have to decide upon the number of chapattis needed for 25 people called for a feast. (b) Ashopkeeper selling shirts has decided to replenish her stock. (c) Weneed to find the height of the door needed in our house. (d) When
