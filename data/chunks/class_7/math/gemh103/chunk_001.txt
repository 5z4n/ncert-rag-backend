litres. Thus, each vessels would have 40 litres of milk. The average or Arithmetic Mean (A.M.) or simply mean is defined as follows: Sum of all observations number of observations mean = Consider these examples. EXAMPLE 1 Ashish studies for 4 hours, 5 hours and 3 hours respectively on three consecutive days. How many hours does he study daily on an average? SOLUTION The average study time of Ashish would be Total number of study hours 44543 Number of days for which he studied ~ 3 Thus, we can say that Ashish studies for 4 hours daily on an average. hours = 4 hours per day Examp.e 2 A batsman scored the following number of runs in six innings: 36, 35, 50, 46, 60, 55 Calculate the mean runs scored by him in an inning. SOLUTION Total runs = 36 + 35 +50 + 46 + 60 + 55 = 282. To find the mean, we find the sum of all the observations and divide it by the number of observations. Therefore, in this case, mean = 6 = 47. Thus, the mean runs scored in an inning are 47. Where does the arithmetic mean lie How would you find the average of your study hours for the whole week? 2024-25 EE CE i emarics Tuink, Discuss AND WRITE Consider the data in the above examples and think on the following: @ Is the mean bigger than each of the observations? \ @ [sit smaller than each observation? r a Discuss with your friends. Frame one more example of thistype 2, ' and answer the same questions. ZL | I You will find that the mean lies inbetween the greatest and the smallest. =a- ~7 observations. In particular, the mean of two numbers will always lie between the two numbers. For =8 , which lies between 5 and 11. Can you use this idea to show that between any two fractional numbers, you can find example the mean of 5 and 11 is 1 1 as many fractional numbers as you like. For example between 5 and q you have their 1 1 + 5 t7 1 3 7 average 2S = > and then between = and 3, you have their average 16 co | Ww 2 8 and so on. 1. Find the mean of your sleeping hours during one week. 1 1 pias 2. Find atleast 5 numbers between 5 and 3 ; 3.2.1 Range The difference between the highest and the lowest observation gives us an idea of the spread of the observations. This can be found by subtracting the lowest observation from the highest observation. We call the result the range of the observation. Look at the following example: EXAMPLE 3 The ages in years of 10 teachers of a school are: 32, 41, 28, 54, 35, 26, 23, 33, 38, 40 (i) What is the age of the oldest teacher and that of the youngest teacher? (ii) What is the range of the ages
