In Margate 1 3 1 1 2 | 4 4 a | 7 4 In Aberdeen By drawing individual bar graphs you could answer questions like (i) In which month does each city has maximum sunlight? or (ii) In which months does each city has minimum sunlight? G & However, to answer questions like In a particular month, which city has more sunshine eae hours , we need to compare the average hours of sunshine of both the cities. To do this we will learn to draw what is called a double bar graph giving the information of both cities side-by-side. This bar graph (Fig 3.1) shows the average sunshine of both the cities. [| Margate Scale : 1 unit = 1 hour of sunshine a Aberdeen = = Hours of sunshine aw fan) N a re. Ne April July Nov. a a [) Z 2 ost ) is i= a. 2 o E & @ A < Fig 3.1 2024-25 EE emarics 1. For each month we have two bars, the heights of which give the average hours of sunshine in each city. From this we can infer that except for the month of April, there is always more sunshine in Margate than in Aberdeen. You could put together a similiar bar graph for your area or for your city. Let us look at another example more related to us. EXAMPLE 10 A mathematics teacher wants to see, whether the new technique of teaching she applied after quarterly test was effective or not. She takes the scores of the 5 weakest children in the quarterly test (out of 25) and uarterl g = Halt Yeay E in the half yearly test (out of 25): = Quarterly 10 15 12 20 9 3 Half yearly | 15 18 16 21 15 SOLUTION Shedraws the adjoining double bar graph and finds a marked improvement in most of the students, the teacher decides 4 E 2 2 5 that she should continue to use the new technique of teaching. < Steclents Can you think of a few more situations where you could use double bar graphs? The bar graph (Fig 3.2) shows the result of a survey to test water resistant watches made by different companies. Each of these companies claimed that their watches were water resistant. After a test the above results were revealed. [_] Number tested (a) Can you work out a fraction of the number of watches [] Number that leaked that leaked to the number tested for each company? Could you tell on this basis which company has better watches?
