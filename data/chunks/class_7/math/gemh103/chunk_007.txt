of the data. They are also called the measures of the central tendency. EXAMPLE 7 Find the median of the data: 24, 36, 46, 17, 18, 25, 35 SOLUTION Wearrange the data in ascending order, we get 17, 18, 24, 25, 35, 36, 46 Median is the middle observation. Therefore 25 is the median. EXERCISE 3.2 1. The scores in mathematics test (out of 25) of 15 students is as follows: 19, 25, 23, 20, 9, 20, 15, 10, 5, 16, 25, 20, 24, 12, 20 Find the mode and median of this data. Are they same? 2. Theruns scored ina cricket match by 11 players is as follows: 6, 15, 120, 50, 100, 80, 10, 15, 8, 10, 15 Find the mean, mode and median of this data. Are the three same? 2024-25 DATA HANDLING ii oe 3. The weights (in kg.) of 15 students of a class are: 38, 42, 35, 37, 45, 50, 32, 43, 43, 40, 36, 38, 43, 38, 47 (i) Find the mode and median of this data. (ii) Is there more than one mode? 4. Find the mode and median of the data: 13, 16, 12, 14, 19, 12, 14, 13, 14 5. Tell whether the statement is true or false: (i) The mode is always one of the numbers in a data. (ii) The mean is one of the numbers in a data. (ii) The median is always one of the numbers in a data. (iv) The data 6, 4, 3, 8,9, 12, 13, 9 has mean 9. 3.5 Use oF Bar GRAPHS WITH A DIFFERENT PURPOSE We have seen last year how information collected could be first arranged in a frequency distribution table and then this information could be put as a visual representation in the form of pictographs or bar graphs. You can look at the bar graphs and make deductions about the data. You can also get information based on these bar graphs. For example, you can say that the mode is the longest bar if the bar represents the frequency. 3.5.1 Choosing a Scale We know that a bar graph is a representation of numbers using bars of uniform width and the lengths of the bars depend upon the frequency and the scale you have chosen. For example, in a bar graph where numbers in units are to be shown, the graph represents one unit length for one observation and if it has to show numbers in tens or hundreds, one unit length can represent 10 or 100 observations. Consider the following examples: EXAMPLE 8Two hundred students of 6" and 7" classes were asked to name their favourite colour so as to decide upon what should be the colour of their school building. The results are shown in the following table. Represent the given data on a bar graph. Answer the following questions with the help of the bar graph: (i) Which is the most preferred colour and which is the least preferred? (it) How many colours are
