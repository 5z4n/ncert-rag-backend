base 6 cm (Fig 9.7). Its height AD which is perpendicular from the vertex A is outside the triangle. a Can you find the area of the triangle? Bt is a GS parallelogram are 4 cm and 3 cm respectively. Find the HG EG GG TE Ec area of the parallelogram (Fig 9.8). Fig 9.7 SOLUTION Given that length of base (b) = 4 cm, height (h) = 3 cm Area of the parallelogram = b x h =4cmX3cm=12 cm EXAMPLE 2 Find the height x if the area of the parallelogram is 24 cm? and the base is 4cm 4cm. Fig 9.8 SOLUTION Area of parallelogram = b x h Therefore,24 = 4 x x (Fig 9.9) Nas or 4 =xor x=6cm Fig 9.9 So, the height of the parallelogram is 6 cm. 2024-25 PERIMETER AND AREA ii. oo EXAMPLE 3The two sides of the parallelogram ABCD are 6 cm and 4 cm. The height corresponding to the base CD is 3 cm (Fig 9.10). Find the (i) area of the parallelogram. (ii) the height corresponding to the base AD. SOLUTION (i) Area of parallelogram = b x h =6cmx3cm=18 cm (il) base (b) = 4cm, height = x (say), Area = 18 cm? A Area of parallelogram = b x x 18=4 xx % _y, ry 4 D 6cm C Therefore, x=4.5cm Fig 9.10 Thus, the height corresponding to base AD is 4.5 cm.
