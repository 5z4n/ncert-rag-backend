QM is the height from Q to SR and QN is the height from Q to PS. If SR = 12 cm and QM = 7.6 cm. Find: M (a) the area of the parallegram PQRS (b) QN, if PS = 8 cm | A B 6. DLand BM are the heights on sides AB and AD - 9.15 respectively of parallelogram ABCD (Fig 9.15). If , the area of the parallelogram is 1470 cm , AB = 35 cm and AD = 49 cm, find the length of BM and DL. 7. AABC is right angled at A (Fig 9.16). AD is perpendicular to BC. If AB =5 cm, BC = 13 cm and AC = 12 cm, Find the area of AABC. Also find the length of B D 43cm Cc Fig 9.16 Fig 9.17 8. AABC is isosceles with AB = AC =7.5 cm and BC = 9 cm (Fig 9.17). The height AD from A to BC, is 6 cm. Find the area of AABC. What will be the height from C to AB i.e., CE? 9.3 CIRCLES A racing track is semi-circular at both ends (Fig 9.18). Can you find the distance covered by an athlete if he takes two rounds of a racing track? We need to find a method to find the distances around when a shape is circular. Fig 9.18 2024-25 PERIMETER AND AREA ii Er 9.3.1 Circumference of a Circle Tanya cut different cards, in curved shape from a cardboard. She wants to put lace around to decorate these cards. What length of the lace does she require for each? (Fig 9.19) 0 Oo (a) Fig oe. You cannot measure the curves with the help of a ruler, as these figures are not straight . Fig 9.20 What can you do? Here is a way to find the length of lace required for shape in Fig 9.19(a). Mark a point on the edge of the card and place the card on the table. Mark the position of the point on the table also B (Fig 9. 20). Now roll the circular card on the table along a straight line till Fig 9.21 the marked point again touches the table. Measure the distance along the line. This is the length of the lace required (Fig 9.21). It is also the distance along the edge of the
