Fig 9.19(a). Mark a point on the edge of the card and place the card on the table. Mark the position of the point on the table also B (Fig 9. 20). Now roll the circular card on the table along a straight line till Fig 9.21 the marked point again touches the table. Measure the distance along the line. This is the length of the lace required (Fig 9.21). It is also the distance along the edge of the card from the marked point back to the marked point. You can also find the distance by putting a string on the edge of the circular object and taking all round it. The distance around a circular region is known as its circumference. Take a bottle cap, a bangle or any other circular object and find the circumference. Now, can you find the distance covered by the athlete on the track by this method? Still, it will be very difficult to find the distance around the track or any other circular . object by measuring through string. Moreover, the measurement will not be accurate. LAL . d So, we need some formula for this, as we have for rectilinear figures or shapes. 2a Let us see if there is any relationship between the diameter and the circumference of the circles. Consider the following table: Draw six circles of different radii and find their circumference by using string. Also find the ratio of the circumference to the diameter. Circle Diameter | Circumference Ratio of Circumference to Diameter 3.5cm 7.0cm 22.0cm Sa 3.14 2024-25 EE i emarics 7.0cm 14.0cm 44.0cm =3.14 [oa [ate [ge == io What do you infer from the above table? Is this ratio approximately the same? Yes. Can you say that the circumference of a circle is always more than three times its diameter? Yes. This ratio is a constant and is denoted by 7 (pi). Its approximate value is = or 3.14. So, we can say that d = 1 where C represents circumference of the circle and d its diameter. or C=ud We know that diameter (d) of a circle is twice the radius (7) 1.e., d= 2r So, C=1d=n x 2r or C = 2mr. Try THESE In Fig 9.22 (a) Which square has the larger perimeter? 7 N (b) Which is larger, perimeter of smaller square or the ~ Z| circumference of the circle? Fig 9.22 Take one each of quarter plate and half plate. Roll once each of these on a table-top. Which plate covers more distance in one complete revolution? Which plate will take less number of revolutions to cover the length of the table-top? 2024-25 PERIMETER AND AREA EXAMPLE 7 Whatis the circumference of acircle of diameter 10 cm (Take t= 3.14)? SOLUTION _ Diameter of the circle (d)= 10cm Circumference of circle = 1d =3.14x10cm=31.4cm So, the circumference of the circle of diameter 10 cmis 31.4cm. EXAMPLE 8 What is the circumference of a circular disc of radius 14 cm?
