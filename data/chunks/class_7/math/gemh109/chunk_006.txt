of a field. He needs > \ ) to purchase fertiliser. If 1 kg of fertiliser is required for | square metre : area, how much fertiliser should he purchase? e What will be the cost of polishing a circular table-top of radius 2 m at the rate of = 10 per square metre? Ke .. Can you tell what we need to find in such cases, Area or Perimeter? In such cases SS =~ we need to find the area of the circular region. Let us find the area of a circle, using graph paper. Draw a circle of radius 4 cm on a graph paper (Fig 9.25). Find the area by counting the number of squares enclosed. As the edges are not straight, we get a rough estimate of the area of circle by this method. 7 \ There is another way of finding the area of a circle. Draw a circle and shade one half of the circle [Fig 9.26(i)]. Now fold the circle into eighths and cut along the folds [Fig 9.26(ii)]. DB Fig 9.26 Arrange the separate pieces as shown, in Fig 9.27, which is roughly a parallelogram. The more sectors we have, the nearer we reach an appropriate parallelogram. 2024-25 Fig 9.25 Fig 9.27 PERIMETER AND AREA ii ey As done above if we divide the circle in 64 sectors, and arrange these sectors. It gives nearly a rectangle (Fig 9.28). _ _ 5 Circumference >| Fig 9.28 What is the breadth of this rectangle? The breadth of this rectangle is the radius of the circle, 1e., 7 . As the whole circle is divided into 64 sectors and on each side we have 32 sectors, the length of the rectangle is the length of the 32 sectors, which is half of the circumference. (Fig 9.28) Area of the circle = Area of rectangle thus formed =/ xb = (Half of circumference) x radius = 5 2mr ) xr=mr So, the area of the circle = 17 Try THESE Draw circles of different radii on a graph paper. Find the area by counting the number of squares. Also find the area by using the formula. Compare the two answers. EXAMPLE 1]2Find the area of a circle of radius 30 cm (use 1 = 3.14). SOLUTION _ Radius, r=30cm Area of the circle = 177 = 3.14 x 30? = 2,826 cm? EXAMPLE 13Diameter of a circular garden is 9.8 m. Find its area. SOLUTION Diameter, d= 9.8 m. Therefore, radius r= 9.8 +2=4.9m 22 22 Area of the circle = 1 = 7 x (4.9) m= > x 4.94.9 m?= 75.46 m2 EXAMPLE 14 The adjoining figure shows two circles with the same centre. The radius of the larger circle is 10 cm and the radius of the smaller circle is 4cm. Find: (a) the area of the larger circle (b) the area of the smaller circle (c) the shaded area between the two circles. (w= 3.14) 2024-25 EE i emarics SOLUTION (a) (b)
