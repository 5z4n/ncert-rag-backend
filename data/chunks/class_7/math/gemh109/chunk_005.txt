plate covers more distance in one complete revolution? Which plate will take less number of revolutions to cover the length of the table-top? 2024-25 PERIMETER AND AREA EXAMPLE 7 Whatis the circumference of acircle of diameter 10 cm (Take t= 3.14)? SOLUTION _ Diameter of the circle (d)= 10cm Circumference of circle = 1d =3.14x10cm=31.4cm So, the circumference of the circle of diameter 10 cmis 31.4cm. EXAMPLE 8 What is the circumference of a circular disc of radius 14 cm? [Use t= 2) SOLUTION _ Radius of circular disc (r) = 14cm Circumference of disc = 27r = 2x=x14 cm= 88cm So, the circumference of the circular disc is 88 cm. EXAMPLE 9 Theradius of acircular pipe is 10 cm. What length of a tape is required to wrap once around the pipe (7 = 3.14)? SOLUTION _ Radius of the pipe (r)=10cm Length of tape required is equal to the circumference of the pipe. Circumference of the pipe = 27r =2x3.14x 10cm = 62.8cm Therefore, length of the tape needed to wrap once around the pipe is 62.8 cm. . 22 EXAMPLE 10Find the perimeter of the given shape (Fig 9.23) (Take n= > ). SOLUTION _Inthisshape we need to find the circumference of semicircles on each side of the square. Do you need to find the perimeter of the square also? No. The outer boundary, of this figure is made up of semicircles. Diameter of each semicircle is 14 cm. We know that: Circumference of the circle = 1d Circumference of the semicircle = > Td = xX = 7 x 14cm =22 cm Circumference of each of the semicircles is 22 cm Therefore, perimeter of the given figure = 4 x 22cm =88cm Fig 9.23 2024-25 EE Hemarics EXAMPLE 11 Sudhanshu divides a circular disc of radius 7 cm in two equal parts. What is the perimeter of each semicircular shape disc? (Use 1 = Fz) SOLUTION To find the perimeter of the semicircular disc (Fig 9.24), we need to find (i) Circumference of semicircular shape (ii) Diameter Given that radius (r) = 7 cm. We know that the circumference of circle = 27r a: the circumference of the semicircle 5 x2tr =r = 7 x 7com=22 cm Fig 9.24 So, the diameter of the circle = 2r=2x7cem=14cm Thus, perimeter of each semicircular disc = 22 cm + 14cm =36 cm 9.3.2 Area of Circle \ Consider the following: = Nes \ i @ =A farmer dug a flower bed of radius 7 m at the centre of a field.
