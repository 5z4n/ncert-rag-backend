22 Area of the circle = 1 = 7 x (4.9) m= > x 4.94.9 m?= 75.46 m2 EXAMPLE 14 The adjoining figure shows two circles with the same centre. The radius of the larger circle is 10 cm and the radius of the smaller circle is 4cm. Find: (a) the area of the larger circle (b) the area of the smaller circle (c) the shaded area between the two circles. (w= 3.14) 2024-25 EE i emarics SOLUTION (a) (b) (c) << 10 cm 9. . Find the circumference of the circles with the following radius: (Take 1 = ) Radius of the larger circle = 10cm So, area of the larger circle = mr? =3.14x 10x 10 =314 cm Radius of the smaller circle = 4cm Area of the smaller circle =r? =3.14x4x4=50.24 cm Area of the shaded region = (314 50.24) cm? = 263.76 cm? EXERCISE 9.2 (a) 14cm (b) 28mm (c) 21cm . Find the area of the following circles, given that: (a) radius = 14mm (Take t= 7) (b) diameter =49 m (c) radius =5 cm . Ifthe circumference of acircular sheet is 154 m, find its radius. Also find the area of the sheet. (Take 7= 7) A gardener wants to fence a circular garden of diameter 21m. Find the length of the rope he needs to purchase, if he makes 2 rounds of fence. Also find the cost of the rope, if it costs % 4 per meter. (Take 1 = z) From a circular sheet of radius 4 cm, a circle of radius 3 cm is removed. Find the area of the remaining sheet. (Take 1 = 3.14) Saima wants to put a lace on the edge of a circular table cover of diameter 1.5 m. Find the length of the lace required and also find its cost if one meter of the lace costs = 15. (Take m = 3.14) 7. Find the perimeter of the adjoining figure, which is a semicircle including its diameter. 8. Find the cost of polishing a circular table-top of diameter 1.6 m, if the rate of polishing is = 15/m?. (Take m= 3.14) Shazli took a wire of length 44 cm and bent it into the shape of a circle. Find the radius of that circle. Also find its area. If the same wire is bent into the shape of a square, what will be the length of each of its sides? Which figure encloses more area, the circle or the square? (Take 1 = z) . From a circular card sheet of radius 14 cm, two circles of radius 3.5 cm and a rectangle of length 3 cm and breadth 1cm are removed. (as shown in the adjoining figure). Find the area of the remaining sheet. (Take 7 = Fz) 2024-25 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17.
