Paper windmill in the picture looks symmetrical (Fig 12.11); but you do not find any line of symmetry. No folding can help you to have coincident halves. However if you rotate it by 90 about the fixed point, the windmill will look exactly the same. We say the windmill has a rotational symmetry. Fig 12.11 D C B A D ae rape afte rp ae 90 90 90 90 Fig 12.12 In a full turn, there are precisely four positions (on rotation through the angles 90 , 180 , 270 and 360 ) when the windmill looks exactly the same. Because of this, we say it has a rotational symmetry of order 4. Here is one more example for rotational symmetry. Consider a square with P as one of its corners (Fig 12.13). Let us perform quarter-turns about the centre of the square marked x. ES -Aa- e (ii) (iii) (iv) Fig 12.13 2024-25 SYMMETRY iE os Fig 12.13 (i) is the initial position. Rotation by 90 about the centre leads to Fig 12.13 (ii). Note the position of P now. Rotate again through 90 and you get Fig 12.13 (iii). In this way, when you complete four quarter-turns, the square reaches its original position. It now looks the same as Fig12.13 (1). This can be seen with the help of the positions taken by P. Thus a square has a rotational symmetry of order 4 about its centre. Observe that in this case, (i) The centre of rotation is the centre of the square. (i) The angle of rotation is 90 . (ii) The direction of rotation is clockwise. (iv) The order of rotational symmetry is 4. Try THESE 1. (a) Can you now tell the order of the rotational symmetry for an equilateral triangle?

Which of the following shapes (Fig 12.15) have rotational symmetry about the marked point. $ (it) (iti) (i) (iv) Fig 12.15 Do Tus Draw two identical parallelograms, one-ABCD on a piece of paper and the other A' B' C' D' on a transparent sheet. Mark the points of intersection of their diagonals, O and O' respectively (Fig 12.16). Place the parallelograms such that A lies on A, B' lies on B and so on. O' then falls on O. 2024-25 EE i emarics Stick a pin into the shapes at the point O. Now turn the transparent shape in the clockwise direction. How many times do the shapes coincide in one full round? What is the order of rotational symmetry? The point where we have the pin is the centre of rotation. It is the intersecting point of the diagonals in this case. Every object has a rotational symmetry of order 1, as it occupies same position after a rotation of 360 (1.e., one complete revolution). Such cases have no interest for
