What is a screen reader, Ma? Motuer: I knew you d ask about it! Well, a screen reader is a software application that helps people who are visually impaired use computers and smartphones. It reads out the text displayed on the screen and provides audio feedback. Anyy__: That s amazing! So, Tara can use a computer just like we do? Motue_r: Yes, she can. Anuj _ : So, it makes a big difference in their daily lives. Motuer: It certainly does. It ensures that people who are visually impaired can use digital services independently, without help from others. This can improve their quality of life. It also opens up more job opportunities in fields like IT, banking, and more, where they can work just efficiently like anybody else. Anuj: Wow! So that means people who are visually impaired can work and do things on their own? I m so proud of my school. Motuer: Yes, and this way, we can ensure that the benefits of Digital Indiareach everyone, helping them to participate fully in all areas of life. Remember, inclusion is not just about having the right tools, but also about having the right mindset. 06-Mar-25 2:47:34 PM
