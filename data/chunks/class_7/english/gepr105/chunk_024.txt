II Now, listen to the poem and correct your answers wherever required. In fields so vast, our soldiers stand, With hearts so brave, and firm command, They guard our land both night and day, To keep our fears and foes at bay. With every dawn and setting sun, Their duty calls, it must be done, Through stormy skies and blazing heat, They march along with steady feet. For love of land, they fight and strive, To keep our hopes and dreams alive, With pride and honour, they defend, Our India, till the very end. Rawr panna Let us listen (refer to page 220) You will listen to the teacher speak about a braveheart. As you listen, complete the bio-table given below. Hello children, you all have read about Rani Abbakka. Let me share with you some details about one more braveheart. Her name is Rani Gaidinliu. Gaidinliu was born on 26 January 1915, in the present-day Tamenglong district of Manipur. She was a Naga leader who led an armed uprising against the British in Manipur, Nagaland, and Assam. Gaidinliu belonged to the Rongmei tribe, also known as the Kabui tribe. 06-Mar-25 2:50:28 PM Unit 5.indd 225 In 1927, at the age of 13, Gaidinliu joined the Heraka movement. This movement aimed at the revival of the Naga tribal religion and the establishment of self-rule for the Nagas, ending British rule. Gaidinliu was arrested in 1932 when she was just 16 and was sentenced to life imprisonment by the British rulers. Between 1932 and 1947, she was kept in several prisons across the Northeast. After being released in 1947, she continued to work for the betterment of her community. The then Prime Minister described Gaidinliu as the Daughter of the Hills and gave her the title Rani for her courage. She was also awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1982. In 1991, Rani Gaidinliu returned to her birthplace, where she died on 17 February 1993 at the age of 78. Rani Gaidinliu was conferred the Birsa Munda Award posthumously. The State Government has developed a park along with a statue to honour Rani Gaidinliu in Silchar, Assam. Not only that, the Government of India issued a postal stamp in her honour in 1996 and a commemorative coin in 2015. What a braveheart indeed! https://amritmahotsav.nic.in/unsung-heroes-detail.htm?56 Notes Unit 5.indd 226 06-Mar-25 2:50:28 PM
