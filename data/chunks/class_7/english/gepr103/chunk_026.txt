page 131) You will listen to a girl speak about the story of how Agartala got its name and the importance of agar. As you listen, choose the correct option for the questions given below. Hi everyone, We all know that Agartala is the capital of Tripura. But did you know how Agartala got its name? It s made up of two words: agar , which is a type of tree, and tala , meaning underneath. So, Agartala means under the agar tree . These trees are also called aloeswood, eaglewood, or gharuwood. It is also referred to as wood of the gods . Agarwood, the wood from these trees, is really special. It smells amazing like a mix of woody and flowery scents. It is one of the rarest and the most expensive woods in the world. People have used it for thousands of years in medicines, perfumes and rituals. It has been described as early as 1400 BCE in the Vedas. The Egyptians are believed to have used agarwood incense as part of their rituals more than 3,000 years ago. Here s something even more remarkable agarwood only forms when the tree is hurt or infected with a bug or virus. Instead of dying, the tree creates this dark, sticky, sweet-smelling substance called agar oil which protects it from further infection. Agarwood is very important to people in Agartala. It s used to make perfumes, incense, and the hand carvings which Tripura is famous for. And here s the best part: the tree was once almost extinct, but now, thanks to people taking care of it, you can find it in almost every house in northern Tripura. How great is that! 06-Mar-25 2:49:27 PM
