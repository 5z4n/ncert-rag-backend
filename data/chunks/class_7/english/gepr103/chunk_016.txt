Himachal is in the north but Arunachal is all the way in the east. I thought all the Pradesh states sat next to each other. : ge We took two trains and drove a long time to get here. St This morning, we walked through a forest to reach our & treehouse. The forest here is so thick that if you blink or so stop to tie your shoelaces, you will get lost. S&S I love Arunachal the best so far and am beginning to enjoy myself. I hope we get to see red pandas. sh) es With love, st) Shaana OSSD SSSSESSES BS | Unit 3.indd 120 06-Mar-25 2:49:14 PM DREAMS AND DISCOVERIES e e & @ oe @ e e e e ( 24 May 20XX & Dear classmates, ( SRE e Y ee e It did not take any time at all to travel south west and get e to the Sundarbans in West Bengal.
