The Age of Reorganisation Tapestry of the Past 08-04-2025 11:38:26 Sanskrit emerged as one of the preferred languages for philosophical and literary works. Do you recall some aspects of the Yoga Sutras in your Physical Education and Well-being classes in Grade 6? These Yoga Sutras were compiled by Patanijali during this period. The Shungas patronised literature, art and architecture. The Bharhut Stapa (in present-day Madhya Pradesh) presents us with beautiful examples of Shunga art. It was probably built during the time of Ashoka, but the Shungas added beautifully carved railings and reliefs depicting stories from the Buddha s life. These are considered some of the earliest examples of Buddhist art. Fe ) an >. Hs I. 2 5 2 er. Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1 Fig.6.5.1. Railings at the Bharhut Stipa.

The Satavahanas From the limited evidence available, the Shungas seem to have waged wars with many of their neighbouring regions. This may have included the Satavahanas, who ruled large parts of the Deccan from the 2nd century BCE onward, to the south of the Shunga Empire. Sometimes referred to as Andhras , the Satavahanas were a powerful dynasty and their empire largely comprised of present-day Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and MaharasnNtra, with different capital cities at different times the most famous were Amravati and Pratishthana (Paithan). Trade and commerce appear to have flourished in the Satavahana kingdom.

The type of ship depicted on the coin above suggests advanced shipbuilding and navigation technologies. Fig.
