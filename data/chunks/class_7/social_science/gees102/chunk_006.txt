water vapour will have a humidity of 100%. In practice, dry weather has a relative humidity range between 20% and 40%, while humid weather usually falls between 60% and 80% relative humidity. Y THINK ABOUT IT If the humidity in Delhi is at 52% while in Kochi it is 84%, in which of the two places are wet clothes likely to dry faster? And where are you likely to sweat more, assuming the temperature is the same in both places? But how do we measure such numbers? This is done through an instrument called a hygrometer. Again, there are several types of hygrometers, depending on the principle they are based on. The measurement of humidity is of great importance in many industrial processes, such as food processing. Museums also monitor humidity as they need to maintain a dry environment to preserve their exhibit. 08-04-2025 12:42:34 Weather Stations As you can see, we need several instruments to measure the weather at a particular place and time. A weather station brings all these instruments together, making it easy to measure and track the weather. Readings of all the measurements are taken at regular intervals, which helps in mapping and forecasting the weather. Fig. 2.11 An automated weather station An Automated Weather Station (AWS) is a self-operating system that uses various sensors to measure and record weather data, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, | precipitation, and atmospheric pressure. Such stations are widely used in fields like agriculture, aviation, navigation, environmental monitoring, and so on, providing accurate and timely weather information without the need for human intervention. DON'T MISS OUT In 2023, the National Disaster Management Authority set up an AWS at a glacial lake of Sikkim at an altitude of more than 4800 metres above sea level. The AWS provides early information about upcoming weather conditions. Fig. 2.12. AWS ata glacial lake of Sikkim Predicting the Weather Meteorologists collect data using these instruments over long periods of time. They study the data and use scientific India and the World: Land and the People 2 - Understanding the Weather Chapter 2.indd 39 08-04-2025 12:42:34 methods to try and predict the weather. Such predictions are very important nowadays, as climate change makes extreme weather, such as droughts, floods, cyclones, etc., more frequent. E a nN Cc) fs Oo _ + z =~ Fog | Heat Wave [e) o .
