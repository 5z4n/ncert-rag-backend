signs do they observe? Document any sayings in your regional language that refer to weather prediction. In the last few centuries, scientists have worked out methods to measure and monitor the elements of the weather with great | precision. Based on those inputs, meteorologists try to predict how the weather will behave in a particular region after a few hours or a few days, or even a few weeks. How do they do it? Do they just look up at the sky and guess? No, they ve got some cool gadgets, a few of which we will now look at. 08-04-2025 12:42:23 Weather Instruments a) Temperature LET'S REMEMBER In your Grade 6 Science textbook, Curiosity, you read about different types of thermometers used for measuring the temperature the clinical thermometer and the laboratory thermometer. You also learnt about temperature scales. One of them is the Celsius scale; another is the Fahrenheit scale. If, for instance, we have a cool temperature of 15 degrees Celsius (noted as 15 C), it is the same as 59 degrees Fahrenheit (noted as 59 F). | Fig. 2.4.1. Snow melts Fig. 2.4.2.

Statistics: The technique of gathering and analysing information or data in order to be able to detect patterns, understand events or make predictions. Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1 Chapter 2.indd 32 There are several types of thermometers. Some simply measure the ambient temperature; others record the maximum and minimum temperatures during a day. Thermometers often use a coloured liquid which expands when the temperature increases. However, more and more, digital thermometers are preferred as they are more precise and can record more data. Indeed, temperature recordings can be used to collect some useful statistics, including: = Range of temperature or the maximum temperature minus the minimum temperature during a particular period of time (usually 24 hours). = Mean daily temperature or the maximum temperature plus the minimum temperature of the day divided by two. DON T MISS OUT > The India Meteorological Department was set up in 1875. Its motto is adityat jayate vrishti, which means, From the sun arises rain. The phrase comes from the ancient text Manusmriti, and the complete sentence reads, From the sun arises rain, from rain comes food, and from food, living beings originate. > Canyouthink ofa reason why rain arises from the sun?
