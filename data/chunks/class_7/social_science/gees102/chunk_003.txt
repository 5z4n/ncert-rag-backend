If Krishnan said it was 20 C in Chennai and he was feeling a little cold, he and Amir would have a measure they could understand. What do you think Amir s reaction to Krishnan s statement might be? b) Precipitation If the news says that a particular place received 30 mm of rainfall in a day, what does it mean? How is rainfall measured? The amount of rainfall is measured with the help of an instrument called arain gauge (Fig. 2.6). When it rains, the water falls into a funnel and is collected in a cylinder. A scale is attached to the cylinder to measure the depth of rainwater collected. For example, when the height of the water collected is 5 mm, we say that the area received 5 mm of rainfall. collecting funnel measuring scale measuring tube India and the World: Land and the People 2 - Understanding the Weather Fig. 2.6. Rain gauge 08-04-2025 12:42:27 LET'S EXPLORE Make a rain gauge as shown in the diagram above. Place the rain gauge in an open area, away from objects that might obstruct rain. Ensure that the rain gauge is on a flat surface and will not tilt or topple with the wind. Using the measuring scale, record the amount of rainwater collected at the same time every day, for a month. (If there is snow, allow it to melt before taking the measurement.) Calculate the average rainfall for every week in that month and comment on the variation from week to week. c) Atmospheric pressure Our bodies are quite aware of temperature and rainfall. But you may also have experienced that the weather sometimes feels heavy , as before a thunderstorm. This is related to atmospheric pressure, which is the pressure exerted by the weight of the air above and around us. The atmospheric pressure is higher near the sea coast and lower as we go higher up into the mountains. When you climb a mountain, the air gets thinner than in the plain below. As a result, the air pressure is lower, and there is less oxygen available for lower pressure (cooler air) Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 7 Part 1 Fig. 2.7 Chapter 2.indd 34 08-04-2025 12:42:29 your lungs to take in. With less oxygen getting into your blood, your body has to work harder to keep you moving! That s why people sometimes feel breathless, dizzy or tired at high altitudes. This does not mean that the atmospheric pressure is always high in the plains below
