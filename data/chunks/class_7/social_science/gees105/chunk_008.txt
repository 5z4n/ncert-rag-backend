One of his most important political concepts is the saptanga (see fig 5.15) or the seven parts that constitute a kingdom. According to Kautilya, the saptdanga together must create a settled, well-protected, and prosperous kingdom to be maintained both through warfare and through alliances for peace, as the case may be. He emphasised the importance of law and order in society, which necessitated a strong administration. He also detailed many
