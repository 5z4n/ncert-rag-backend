AM 6. Lookat the real life situation that a retail seller of vegetables encountered: A family came to shop for vegetables. The price of beans that the seller on the cart was offering was ~30/kg. The lady started to bargain with the seller to bring the price down to 25/kg. The seller protested and refused to sell at that price saying he would make a loss at that price. The lady walks away. The family then goes to a super bazaar nearby. They buy vegetables in the super bazaar where they pay ~40/kg for the beans that is neatly packed in a plastic bag.
