heat and light Fig. 5.5: Burning magnesium ribbon are also produced along with the formation of a new substance in this reaction. The burning of magnesium ribbon can be represented as Magnesium + Oxygen Magnesium oxide + Heat + Light (Ribbon) (Air) (White powder) A chemical reaction in which a substance reacts with oxygen and produces heat and/or light is called combustion. Substances that undergo combustion reactions are called combustible substances. For example, wood, paper, cotton, kerosene, etc., are combustible substances. Fig. 5.4: Rusted iron nails Let us find out whether the presence of oxygen is essential for combustion. | Activity 5.5: Let us investigate y * Place two identical candles on two separate petri dishes and light them. + Cover one of these with a glass tumbler, as shown in Fig. 5.6.

Why does this happen? Since the candle covered by the glass tumbler does not have a continuous supply of air, the flame gets extinguished soon. The component of air that supports combustion is oxygen. This can be confirmed by the presence of carbon dioxide in the glass tumbler inverted on the candle. How can you test the presence of carbon dioxide gas? You can test the carbon dioxide gas by adding a small amount of lime water in the petri dish. You will notice that it turns milky. This carbon dioxide was formed by the carbon from the wax and the oxygen from the air. In other words, oxygen is required for combustion. oa = 1S) xo] < x wn ~~ = a. wv =) xo] < =] (=) i a wn oa fo)] < = 1S) SCIENCE AND SOCIETY If a person s clothes catch fire, what is the best way to extinguish the fire? Wrap a blanket or cloth around the person. This cuts off the supply of air, and the fire gets extinguished. Caution Synthetic blanket or cloth should never be used to put out a fire, as these can melt and stick to the skin. FASCINATING FACTS Nature s wonders: You might have seen some insects emitting light in a garden or a field in late evenings. These insects are called fireflies, and their light is produced by a chemical = change. This type of light production (without heat) in living organisms is called bioluminescence. Fireflies Is the Presence of Air Enough for Combustion? We learnt above that combustible substances and oxygen are necessary for combustion. We also know that paper is a combustible substance, but we can keep it in the air
