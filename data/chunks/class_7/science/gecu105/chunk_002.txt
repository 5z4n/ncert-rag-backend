o Chapter 5.indd 61 Calcium hydroxide + Carbon dioxide Calcium carbonate + Water (Lime water) (Insoluble substance) The turning of lime water milky is also used as a test for carbon dioxide. Let us explore this with another activity using some substances from our kitchen. | Activity 5.4: Let us experiment | Take a teaspoonful of vinegar or lemon juice in a test tube. Add a pinch of baking soda (sodium hydrogen carbonate) to it. What do you observe? You would hear a fizzing bubbling sound and see the gas bubbles forming. Pass this gas through freshly prepared lime water kept in another test tube, as shown in Fig. 5.3a. What do you observe? The lime water turns milky. What do you infer about the gas formed by mixing vinegar and baking soda? This indicates that the gas formed is carbon dioxide. This activity can also be performed using two small used bottles instead of test tubes and a flexible straw, as shown in Fig. 5.3b. >, ~ >, ~ >, ~ >, ~ >, ~ >, ~ >, ~ Lime water => Bubbles of ~ carbon dioxide gas Vinegar and baking soda Fig. 5.3: Reaction of vinegar and baking soda Since a new substance, carbon dioxide, is formed in this reaction, we say that a chemical change has occurred here as well. It can be represented as Vinegar + Baking soda Carbon dioxide + Other substances Repeat the above activity using baking soda and water. Do you observe any bubble formation? Is this a physical or a chemical change? 2 o = U xo] < wn ~~ = a. wv =) xo] < =] (=) i a U) o fo)] < = U 4/3/2025 4:52:48 PM 5.3 Some Other Processes Involving Chemical Changes Rp ih hid ht Alli chllrd Ad dodeihd dele At dodo tad ctagly) 5.3.1 Rusting In the rusting of iron, which you studied in the chapter The World of Metals and Non-metals , a new _ brown-coloured substance called rust is formed. Thus, rusting is also a chemical change because it involves the formation of a new substance, iron oxide (Fig. 5.4). 5.3.2 Combustion Let us recall the burning of a magnesium ribbon (Fig. 5.5) learnt in the chapter The World of Metals and Non-metals . Can you predict if this is a physical or a chemical change? When the magnesium ribbon is burnt, a new substance, magnesium oxide, is formed. So, the burning of magnesium ribbon also involves a = chemical change. We observed that heat and light Fig. 5.5: Burning magnesium ribbon are also produced along with the formation of a new substance in this reaction. The burning of magnesium ribbon can be represented as Magnesium + Oxygen Magnesium oxide + Heat + Light (Ribbon) (Air) (White powder) A chemical reaction in which a substance reacts with oxygen and produces heat and/or light is called combustion. Substances that undergo combustion reactions are called combustible substances. For example, wood, paper, cotton, kerosene, etc., are combustible
