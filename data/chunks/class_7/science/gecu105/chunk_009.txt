The message will become invisible. Now use a warm iron over the paper (or hold the paper over the flame of a candle, taking care that it does not catch fire). The invisible letters turn dark brown as the paper gets warm. Can any of these changes be reversed? /J\ Caution Perform this activity under the supervision of an adult. + We hear a lot of news about landslides and breaking of rocks in hilly regions these days, causing a lot of damage to life and property. Discuss what steps we can take to reduce landslides and rock erosion. Disciplinary History Geography Society >, ~ Observe the activities going on in the kitchen and note any changes that can be reversed. Are these physical or chemical technology 4 Economy changes?

Try and find out! e Take a small bottle, some sugar, fresh yeast, water, and a balloon. Make a sugar solution in the bottle by mixing two teaspoons of sugar and a small amount of water. Now add a spoonful of yeast and cover the mouth of the bottle with a balloon. Leave it undisturbed for about an hour. e What do you observe? e Carefully take off the balloon, holding its mouth tightly closed and attach it to another small bottle containing freshly prepared lime water. Shake the bottle so that the contents of the balloon get mixed with lime water. e What do you observe? e What can you conclude from this experiment? e Identify all the changes occurring in the experiment and state which of them are physical and chemical changes. Chameleons (Girgits) change colour to blend in with their surroundings and also when they are angry or sense danger (Fig. 5.12). Is this a change that can be reversed?
