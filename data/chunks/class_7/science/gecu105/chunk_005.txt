Fig. 5.9: What changes occur when a candle burns? The wax of the candle melts, is carried up the wick, and evaporates due to the heat of the flame. The vapour of wax burns to produce a flame. The melting of wax, its solidification, and evaporation are physical changes. The burning of vapour on the other hand, is a chemical change. This shows that the burning of a candle involves both physical and chemical changes. KNOW A SCIENTIST The candle you just observed has long been an object of curiosity for several scientists including Michael Faraday, who made significant contributions to several areas of science. In the nineteenth century, Faraday delivered a series of lectures called Chemical History of a Candle. Faraday believed that the candle was the perfect object to introduce scientific study. Through it, he discussed differences between various physical and chemical processes like melting, vapourisation, and combustion. AS Chapter 5.indd 65 4/3/2025 4:52:53 PM 5.5 Are Changes Permanent? (pS ee) Once something has undergone a change, can we get it back in its original form? _Activity 5.8: Let us think _ | Think again about all the changes that we have discussed or talked about so far. In which of these can we get back the object or substance in the form we started with? Record your observations in Table 5.2. Table 5.2: Can changes be reversed? 1. Melting ice cubes Yes 2. Chopping vegetables No 3. Boiling water Yes 4. Making popcorn from corn No 5. 12. Returning to the original object or substance with which we started shows that the changes we brought can be reversed. For example, when ice melts, it can be refrozen into ice. Similarly, when water evaporates, it can be condensed back into liquid water. However, some changes cannot be reversed since we cannot get the original object or substance back after the change. For example, chopped vegetables cannot return to their original size and shape, and making popcorn cannot go back to its original form. Thus, changes around us could be grouped into those that can be reversed and those that cannot be reversed. 5.6 Are All Changes Desirable? (Gpsrrrvindcceided EAS ees) Many useful changes happen in our daily life. For example, the changing of milk into curd, ripening of fruits, cutting of fruits, and cooking of food. All these are desirable changes. Can you think of some other desirable changes happening around you? iF Chapter 5.indd 66 4/3/2025 4:52:53 PM | i) cS rT) oa 13) < a .>] ~n a] ) x Cd = > Y) ss] =] s) On the other hand, some changes may be undesirable, such as
