-= 0777CHOS It has now become water! A bud that I saw yesterday on this rose plant has become a flower today. The bottle containing cold water is not cold anymore. Yesterday, I saw some brown spots on a banana, but today it has more brown spots and a strong smell. These students are describing some changes. What kinds of changes are they talking about? Chapter 5.indd 57 4/3/2025 4:52:45 PM [ Activity 5.1: Let us think and reflect [ You might have observed various changes happening around you. Some of them are listed in Table 5.1, you may notice that something is changing in each case. Take a moment to reflect on the changes in each case. Record your observations in Table 5.1. able 5.1: Some changes observed around us You might have noticed that these changes could be in the size, shape, smell, or other property of the substance or object. Can you think of some other changes that happen in your surroundings? Make a list of those changes too. We observe the changes occurring around us with the help of our senses of sight, smell, touch, hearing, and taste. Can we arrange these _ changes into categories?

Creating some objects with paper + Take a few sheets of paper and fold them to create new objects (Fig. 5.1). + Do you get the same paper back when you unfold these objects? B. Playing with a balloon + Take a balloon and inflate it. Now, loosen your grip and let the air escape out. Fig. 5.1: Objects made from paper Do you get the uninflated balloon back? Changes Around Us: Physical and Chemical >, ~ >, ~ Take another balloon; inflate it and grip the opening tightly. Now, prick it with a pin. /\ caution Be careful while using a pin. + What happens? Will you be able to get the uninflated balloon back? C. Crushing a piece of chalk + Crush a small piece of chalk into powder. + Can you get the chalk piece back from the powder? Is there any similarity in the changes listed in A, B, and C? During all these changes, materials, such as the paper, the rubber sheet of the balloon, and the chalk, remained the same, though their appearances (shape or size) may have changed. You may also recall from the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity that water can exist in different states (solid, liquid, and gas), and can change from one state to another. In all these cases, although we observe a change in the appearance, no new substance is formed. Such changes in which only physical properties like
