Many useful changes happen in our daily life. For example, the changing of milk into curd, ripening of fruits, cutting of fruits, and cooking of food. All these are desirable changes. Can you think of some other desirable changes happening around you? iF Chapter 5.indd 66 4/3/2025 4:52:53 PM | i) cS rT) oa 13) < a .>] ~n a] ) x Cd = > Y) ss] =] s) On the other hand, some changes may be undesirable, such as the rusting of iron or the decay of food during its storage. A change that is undesirable in some situations may be desirable in other situations. For example, decomposition of food can be very useful in converting food waste into compost. Some changes occurring over the years due to human activity can have a long-term environmental impact. For example, the increased consumption of fuels in cars, trains, aeroplanes, etc., is increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Drying of paint on walls, doors, furniture, etc., releases many substances through evaporation, causing atmospheric pollution. 5.7 Some Slow Natural Changes (Gp dno AS Le) 5.7.1 Weathering of rocks Have you seen heaps of sand, soil, and stones lying at the base of mountains as shown in Fig. 5.10a? These are called sediments. How have these formed? These are formed by physical changes that break up large rocks into smaller pieces. Temperature changes due to climatic conditions, growing roots of trees, and even freezing of water within cracks in the rocks can cause them to break. Water or chemicals present in water, can also react with the rocks and cause chemical changes in their composition. An example of such a chemical change is shown in Fig. 5.10b. Here, an originally black-coloured rock called basalt, which contains iron, has chemically changed to produce a red-coloured layer. The red colour is a result of the iron oxide produced when the rock surface was exposed for a long time to water or air containing water vapour. These physical and chemical changes in rocks are collectively called weathering, which eventually leads to the formation of soil. a o = U cS < = wn a = a. wv =) cS < =] i U) o fo)] < = U @ nn) Fig. 5.10: (a) Sediments at the base of a cliff (b) red sediment layer Chapter 5.indd 67 4/3/2025 4:52:54 PM Ss oO cS iC) ao 13) < uu n a] =) x . a = > U7) A) ss] = o 5.7.2 Erosion Have you noticed fine sand collecting on riverbeds or in lakes? This sand is formed when rock pebbles, soil, and sediments are broken down and moved from one location to another by natural forces like wind and flowing water. This process is called erosion. Erosion during a landslide is an example of a physical change. River rocks and pebbles often appear smoother due to the constant erosion caused by the flowing water. When the speed of the water or wind decreases,
