seen some insects emitting light in a garden or a field in late evenings. These insects are called fireflies, and their light is produced by a chemical = change. This type of light production (without heat) in living organisms is called bioluminescence. Fireflies Is the Presence of Air Enough for Combustion? We learnt above that combustible substances and oxygen are necessary for combustion. We also know that paper is a combustible substance, but we can keep it in the air for any length of time without it catching fire. What else is needed to start combustion? Let us learn about this.

It quickly catches fire. Do we say that we need a fire to start the burning process? >, ~ Take another piece of paper. Using a magnifying glass, focus the sunrays to make the smallest and brightest spot on the paper, as shown in the Fig. 5.7a. Hold it there for some time. Fig. 5.7(a): Focusing the sunrays using a What do you observe? 1g. oO. : usL u 6 magnifying glass > 6 We observe that the paper starts to emit smoke, and then catches fire (Fig. 5.7b). Thus, we find that a substance can burn even without fire. How do we explain this change? Focusing sunrays on the paper heats it. The temperature of the paper increases with time. After some time, the paper becomes so hot that it starts burning. This minimum temperature at which a substance catches fire is called its ignition temperature. Since the temperature of the lighted matchstick was already higher than Fig. 5.7(b): Paper catching fire the ignition temperature of the paper, it caught fire almost immediately. So, we can conclude that for the combustion process to occur, there are three requirements (Fig. 5.8) (i) A combustible substance, also called fuel (ii) Oxygen (iii) Heat that allows the fuel to reach its ignition temperature.
