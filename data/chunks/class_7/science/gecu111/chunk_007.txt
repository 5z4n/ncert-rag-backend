The image of the candle flame is upside down, that is, inverted. Let us now make a pinhole camera, which you can Take a piece of cardboard and a candle. Make a small hole in the cardboard. In a dimly lit room, position the cardboard at a short distance from a screen. Place a lighted candle in front of it as shown in Fig. 11.12a. What do you see on the screen? Light coming the screen. Do you notice anything surprising? use outdoors. Activity 11.10: Let us construct_| ae > >, ~ >, ~ >, ~ Take two boxes of cardboard such that one can slide into another with very little gap in between them. Cut open one side of each box. On the opposite face of the larger box, make a small hole in the middle (Fig. 11.13a). On the opposite face of the smaller box, cut out a square from the middle with a side of about 5-6 cm. Cover this opening with a thin translucent paper (like a tracing paper) to form a screen (Fig. 11.13b). Slide the smaller box inside the larger one in such a way that the side with the tracing paper is inside (Fig. 11.13 ). Hold the pinhole camera with the pinhole facing the object and look through the open side of the smaller box. Cover your head and the camera with a dark cloth. Look at a distant object, like a tree or building, in bright sunlight and move the smaller box forward or backward until an image appears on the tracing paper. Do the images seen in the camera show the colours of the objects on the other side? Are the images erect or upside down?
