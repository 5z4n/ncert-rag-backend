Hence, these substances are basic in nature. >, ~ The substances in Group C, such as tap water, sugar solution, and salt solution, did not change the colour of either litmus paper. Can you predict their nature? Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 These substances are said to be neutral because they are neither acidic nor basic.

Can you recall their taste? You will find that all these substances taste sour. Thus, we can say that substances that taste sour tend to contain acids and are acidic in nature. /\\ Caution Do not taste anything until asked to do so. Do not taste any unknown substance. Some common edible substances and the names of the most common acids present in them are given in Fig. 2.4. /_, $ eo.

Rub the baking soda solution between your fingers. What do you observe? It feels soapy or slippery. Basic substances are generally slippery to touch. Also, bases generally taste bitter, but everything that tastes bitter may not contain a base. For example, bitter gourd (karela) possesses a bitter taste but is not basic in nature. Now, I can check the nature of floor cleaning liquid using an indicator! If litmus is not available, are there some other natural substances that can serve as_ acid-base indicators?

Try making your indicators using these flowers. | Activity 2.3: Let us prepare | + Collect some fallen petals of red roses available in your rl surroundings (Fig. 2.5). It is advised not to pluck flowers. You may pick petals or flowers fallen on the ground.
