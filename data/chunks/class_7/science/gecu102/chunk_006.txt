Chapter 2.indd 16 4/3/2025 4:50:51 PM KNOW A SCIENTIST Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray (P.C. Ray) is known as the Father of Modern Indian Chemistry . He earned a doctorate in chemistry from the United Kingdom and returned to India. He contributed towards advancing scientific research in India. He also established India s first pharmaceutical company (a company in the field of medicines) in 1901. He was a person rooted in Indian culture and knowledge traditions. Through his writings on the history of chemistry in India, he highlighted the ; achievements and expertise of ancient Ay Indian scientists to the modern world. Ray, a social reformer, * also advocated the use of the mother tongue as a medium of instruction in educational institutions. Exploring Substances: Acidic, Basic, and Neutral 2.2 What Happens When Acidic Substances Mix with Basic Substances? (PPD lah ia alelllddladich ded daodad dle edi odathategly) Let us investigate by performing the following experiment. | | Activity 2.7: Let us experiment | + Take one drop of lemon juice in a test tube and add around twenty drops of water to it. Observe the colour. Add a drop of blue litmus solution to it. >, ~ Fig. 2.10(a): The colour of the Do you observe any colour change (Fig. 2.10a)? solution on adding blue litmus solution >, ~ >, ~ Slowly add drops of lime water to this test tube with the help of a dropper and swirl it well. What do you observe? Is there any change in the colour of the solution? A stage comes when the colour of the solution >, ~ >, ~ changes from red to blue (Fig. 2.10b). Again, add one drop of lemon juice to the above solution. >, ~ Can you predict why there is a change in colour? Fig. 2.10(b): The colour of the solution on adding lime water Chapter 2.indd 17 4/3/2025 4:50:52 PM Initially, when a drop of blue litmus solution is added to the lemon juice solution, the colour of the solution turns red. When lime water is added to this test tube, the colour of the solution eventually changes from red to blue. This shows that the solution in the test tube is no longer acidic. Lime water has neutralised the effect of the acid. When the solution of an acid is mixed with the solution of a base in sufficient quantity, we find that the resulting solution is neither acidic nor basic. Such reactions are called neutralisation reactions. In a neutralisation reaction, salt and water
