Table 2.2) From the above activity, we can conclude that the red rose extract can also be used to test the nature of the substances; hence, it is another example of an acid-base indicator. We can conclude that the red rose extract seems to give red colour in an acidic solution and green colour in a basic solution. Can you now fill in the nature of the substances in Table 2.3? ro i a s < i} a i.)

You may repeat the process of preparing the extract and testing substances with some vegetables, fruits, or flowers, such as beetroot, purple cabbage, turmeric, Indian blackberry (jamun), and red hibiscus (gudhal) flower. They can also act as acid-base indicators. FASCINATING FACTS Hydrangea is a plant that grows in cooler climates in the Himalayan region and the North-eastern states. It gives flowers of different colours, depending on the nature of the soil. Acidic soil produces bluef@ coloured flowers, whereas in basic soil, the flowers are pink or red. Can gardeners alter the colour of hydrangea flowers by adjusting the acidic or basic nature of the soil? Hydrangea flowers 2.1.3 Turmeric as an indicator We have used blue and red litmus paper strips in Activity 2.1. Can you also make paper strips with some other natural indicators? Find out by performing the following activity. | Activity 2.5: Let us prepare | + Take aspoonful of turmeric (haldi) in a petri dish or container and add a little water to make a paste (Fig. 2.9a). You may also grind a piece of fresh turmeric. + Carefully dip a piece of filter paper in the turmeric paste until it gets yellow colour. + Take it out and allow it to dry. + Cut this yellow paper into thin strips, which are used as turmeric paper (Fig. 2.9b). /\ caution Perform this step under the supervision of an adult.
