Record the data in Table 2.2. Table 2.2: Grouping of samples tested in Table 2.1 Group A Group B Group C Chapter 2.indd 9 4/3/2025 4:50:43 PM _~, 1 am curious to know what are these red and blue litmus paper strips made of? Why do they change colour when drops of some samples are put on them? Fig. 2.3: Blue and red litmus Let us find out! paper strips Litmus is a natural substance obtained from lichens. It is available both as a solution and in the form of paper strips, known as litmus paper. The litmus paper is available in two colours blue and red, as shown in Fig. 2.3. Substances that turn blue litmus paper to red are acidic in nature, while those that turn red litmus paper to blue are basic in nature. Since litmus shows different colours in acidic and basic solutions, it is called an acid-base indicator. Some other substances, both natural and synthetic, can also be used as indicators. Synthetic indicators are made in laboratories, and you will learn more about them in higher grades. HOLISTIC LENS Lichens are formed by the association of two living organisms, a fungus and an alga. They grow on rocks and trees in regions that have abundant rainfall and clean air. Do you find lichens on trees in your neighbourhood? Now, let us classify the substances sorted in Group A, Group B, and Group C in Table 2.2. * The substances in Group A, such as lemon juice, amla juice, tamarind water, and vinegar turned the blue litmus paper to red, implying that these substances are acidic in nature. The substances in Group B, such as soap solution, baking soda solution, lime water, and washing powder solution turned the red litmus paper to blue. Hence, these substances are basic in nature. >, ~ The substances in Group C, such as tap water, sugar solution, and salt solution, did not change the colour of either litmus paper. Can you predict their nature? Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 These substances are said to be neutral because they
