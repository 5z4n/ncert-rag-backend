Exploring Substances: Acidic, Basic, and Neutral On 28 February, the school hosted a science fair to celebrate National Science Day. At the entry gate, siblings Ashwin and Keerthi were greeted with a white sheet of paper. They were curious to know why a white sheet of paper was given to them! A few steps ahead, there was a volunteer spraying a liquid ia on these sheets of paper. The siblings also got their white sheets sprayed. To their surprise, the words Welcome to the Wonderful World of Science appeared on the papers the moment the liquid was sprayed (Fig. 2.1). They were excited and eager to know how this happened and the reason behind it. Their curiosity was partly satisfied at the Colourful World of Substances stall. They saw many activities showing colour changes on mixing different substances. They decided to explore these changes further. Let us join them on this learning adventure. , i) | y = 2) National Science Day aN C; i | Chapter 2.indd 7 4/3/2025 4:50:42 PM Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 Chapter 2.indd 8 2.1 Nature Our Science Laboratory 2.1.1 Litmus as an indicator | Activity 2.1: Let us explore | * Collect samples of lemon juice, soap solution, amla juice, tamarind water, vinegar, baking soda solution, lime water, tap water, washing powder solution, sugar solution, and salt solution. > Take a strip of blue litmus paper and cut it into small pieces. + Spread these pieces on a clean and dry white tile. + Using a dropper, put one drop of each of the samples, one-by-one, on these litmus paper pieces, as shown in Fig. 2.2a.

Fig. 2.2(b): Colour change in red litmus paper How to prepare lime water? Do not confuse lime water with the word lime, which is a fruit similar to lemon. Lime water (solution of calcium hydroxide in water) can be easily prepared by mixing lime (chuna, i.e. calcium oxide) in water and leaving it undisturbed for some time, say an hour. Filter the liquid into another container and use it as lime water. 4/3/2025 4:50:43 PM | Table 2.1: Testing the nature of samples with blue and red litmus papers | Colour of blue Colour of red litmus paper after _ litmus paper after putting a drop of putting a drop of sample sample S.No. Name of the sample 1.
