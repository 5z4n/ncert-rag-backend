is advised not to pluck flowers. You may pick petals or flowers fallen on the ground. Take a fistful of the collected petals of red roses and wash them with water. >, ~ >, ~ Crush the petals using a mortar Fig. 2.5: Red roses and pestle. Fig. 2.6: Red rose petals immersed in hot water >, ~ Place them in a glass tumbler. >, ~ Pour some hot water into the glass tumbler to ensure that the crushed flower petals are completely immersed. /\ Caution Perform this step under the supervision of an adult. + Cover the glass tumbler with a lid. Wait for 5-10 minutes till the water becomes coloured (Fig. 2.6), and filter it. + The filtrate (liquid after filtration) is the required flower extract (Fig. 2.7) to be used as an acid-base indicator. | <__SSSSS __ Test tue Test tube stand Red rose extract Fig. 2.7: Test tube containing the red rose extract [Activity 2.4: Let us find out | * Place 10-20 drops of the prepared red rose extract in each of two small transparent bottles or test tubes.

Are the samples that change the colour of the flower extract to a shade of red the same as those that changed the colour of blue litmus paper to red? (Group A, Table 2.2) Are the samples that change the colour of the flower extract to a shade of green the same as those that changed the colour of red litmus paper to blue? (Group B, Table 2.2) ** Are the samples that do not change the colour of the flower extract the same as those that did not change the colour of red and blue litmus papers? (Group C, Table 2.2) From the above activity, we can conclude that the red rose extract can also be used to test the nature of the substances; hence, it is another example of an acid-base indicator. We can conclude that the red rose extract seems to give red colour in an acidic solution and green colour in a basic solution. Can you now fill in the nature of the substances in Table 2.3? ro i a s < i} a i.) Z
