have an instrument which measures and displays the vehicle s speed in km/h. It is called a speedometer. Another instrument, known as an odometer, is also fitted in the vehicles that measures the distance travelled by the vehicle in kilometre. Speedometer Odometer I once watched a part of marathon on a straight road stretch. I noticed that some people seemed to be running at the same speed during that distance while some people would speed up or slow down. | How were their motion different? 8.4 Uniform and Non-uniform Linear Motion Oa hi ith ha lit ht heath heath helt ta tal Do you remember learning about linear motion in the chapter Measurement of Length and Motion in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity? When an object moves along a straight line, its motion is called linear motion. Now, imagine a train on a track which is along a straight line between two adjacent railway stations. So, the motion of the train between these two stations is an example of linear motion (Fig. 8.11). The train starts from the first station A at a slow speed, then moves at a faster speed, then slows down and comes to a halt at the next station D. In between the two stations, for some distance (B to C), the train moves at a constant speed, that is, at an unchanging speed.

So, the train is in uniform motion between B and C (Fig. 8.11). On the other hand, if the speed of an object moving along a straight line keeps changing, it is said to be in non-uniform linear motion. The motion of the train between A and B, as well as between C and D, is non-uniform (Fig. 8.11). An object in uniform linear motion covers equal distances in equal intervals of time, while it covers unequal distances in equal intervals of times when it is in non-uniform linear motion. In Table 8.3, data are given for the distances travelled by two trains, X and Y, between the time 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM. < c td (=) = GS Sj i] oO E = = (-) i<j oO E oO Pe iH} 2) oO = Table 8.3: Distances travelled by two trains in equal time intervals of 10 minutes Train X Train Y Time 5 = 7 (AM) Position Distance Position Distance (km) (km) (km) (km) 10:00 0 0 0 0 10:10 20 20 20 20 10:20 40 20 35 15 10:30 60 20 50 15 10:40 80 20 75 25 10:50 100 20 95 20 11:00 120 20 120 25 Which of the two trains is in uniform linear motion between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM?
