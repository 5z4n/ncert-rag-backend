Train X covers equal distances in equal intervals of time, so it is in uniform linear motion while Train Y is in non-uniform linear motion. Uniform linear motion is an idealisation. In everyday life, we seldom find objects moving with a constant speed over long distances or for long intervals of time. That is why we have to use average speeds.

The time period of a simple pendulum of a given length is constant at a place. The SI unit of time is the second. Its symbol is s. The average speed of an object is the total distance covered divided by the total time taken to cover it. An object moving along a straight line with a constant speed is said to be in uniform linear motion. If the speed of an object moving along a straight line keeps changing, it is said to be in non-uniform linear motion. Let Us Enhance Our Learning Time (s) (ee hd Sg . Calculate the speed of a car that travels 150 metres in 10 seconds. Express your answer in km/h. . A runner completes 400 metres in 50 seconds. Another runner completes the same distance in 45 seconds. Who has a greater speed and by how much? . A train travels at a speed of 25 m/s and covers a distance of 360 km. How much time does it take? . Atrain travels 180 km in 3 h. Find its speed in: (i) km/h (ii) m/s (iii) What distance will it travel in 4h ifit maintains the same speed throughout the journey? . The fastest galloping horse can reach the speed of approximately 18 m/s. How does this compare to the speed of a train moving at 72 km/h? . Distinguish between uniform and non-uniform motion using the example of a car moving on a straight highway with no traffic and a car moving in city traffic. . Data for an object covering distances in different intervals of time are given in the following table. If the object is in uniform motion, fill in the gaps in the table. 0 10 20 30 50 70 Distance (m) 0 8 24 32 40 56 0 OF 4/3/2025 4:54:47
