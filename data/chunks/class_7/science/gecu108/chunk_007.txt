Which is the fastest train? The train which has covered the maximum distance in unit time is the fastest train, that is, the one with the highest speed. 8.3.1 Relationship between speed, distance, and time We already know how to calculate speed using Total distance covered Speed. = _ _ _ Total time taken if the distance travelled and time taken for it are known to us. We can write this equation in a different form to calculate the distance covered by an object, if we know its speed and the time taken, by using Total distance covered = Speed Total time taken Similarly, we can also calculate the time an object will take to cover a distance, if the distance and speed are given, by using Total distance covered Speed Example 8.2: Raghav is going to a neighbouring city in a bus moving at a speed of 50 km/h. If it takes him 2 h to reach that city, how far is that city? Solution: Distance covered by bus = Speed x Time Total time taken = km = 50 x2hk K = 100 km Example 8.3: A train is travelling at a speed of 90 km/h. How much time will it take to cover a distance of 360 km? Distance covered Speed 360k katt h =4h In all the examples so far, we have found the speed of an object by using the total distance covered divided by the total time taken . However, the object might not have travelled with the same speed during the entire duration of time. The object might have sometimes moved slower or sometimes faster. So, the speed that we have calculated is the average speed, but, in this book, we have used the term speed for average speed .

It is called a speedometer. Another instrument, known as an odometer, is also fitted in the vehicles that measures the distance travelled by the vehicle in kilometre. Speedometer Odometer I once watched a part of marathon on a straight road stretch. I noticed that some people seemed to be running at the same speed during that distance while some people would speed up or slow down. |
