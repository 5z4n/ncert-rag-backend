in a given interval of time decide which one is faster or slower. We often say that the faster runner has a higher speed. You are probably familiar with the word speed . 8.3 Speed [SS Sennnnsso>> ene | By comparing the distances moved by two or more objects in a unit time, it can be found out which of them is moving faster. The unit time may be one second or one minute or one hour. We call the distance covered by an object in a unit time as the speed of the object. How can we determine the speed of an object? It can be calculated, if we know the total distance covered by an object and the time taken to cover it. The speed of an object is the total distance covered divided by the total time taken to cover it. Thus, Total distance covered Total time taken What would be the unit of speed? We know the SI units of length and time. Since the speed is distance/time, the SI unit of speed is metre/second and is expressed as m/s. Speed can also be expressed in other units. If we express the distance in kilometre and time in hour, then the unit of speed is kilometre/hour, expressed as km/h.

Identify a train stopping at the railway station nearest to your place of stay. Find out the name of the next station where this train stops. Also, find the distance to that station as given in the timetable. Note the time at which the train departs from your station and arrives at the next station. Find the difference to calculate the time taken by the train to cover the distance till the next station. Calculate the speed of the train between the two stations and record it in Table 8.2. Repeat for 4-5 different types of trains (Passenger/ Express/ Superfast).
