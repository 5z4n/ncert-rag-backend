oscillations and calculate its time period. Repeat it a few times with children of different weights to find out if its time period is almost the same. Repeat this with swings of different lengths. Find out how the time period changes with increasing length of the swings. Is the swing also an example of a pendulum? 55 60 INNOVATION DISCOVERY ENQUIRY EXPLORATION Measurement of Time and Motion 4/3/2025 4:54:47 PM + Gather the timings of the winners of the races 100 m, 200 m, and 400 m for men and women in the last two Olympic games. Calculate and compare their speeds. In which event is the speed the fastest? FASCINATING FACTS Time started when our Universe was created and will continue in the future. We cannot see or feel time but we can only measure its passage in terms of a time interval between events. These time intervals can be fractions of Disciplinary History a second, or even days or months, or years or centuries. We can only say when an event occurred or for how Geography 4 Society long it lasted. Though we have learnt to measure time with increasing accuracy, and our lives are governed by watches and clocks, What is time? continues to be a tricky question with no easy answer!
