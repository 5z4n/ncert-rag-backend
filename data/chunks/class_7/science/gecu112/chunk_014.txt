our time to ask you one. | Have you looked closely at the front and back covers of , this science textbook? At first, they may just look like regular | scenes from a playground or a running track, but if you observe carefully, you'll find tiny hidden science clues connected to different chapters in the book! Take a closer look maybe you will spot something related to what we discussed about motion or light, or maybe even about plants and animals? Challenge yourself to find as many science links with the chapters as you can (we think there are more than 25!). And , who knows you might find connections that the authors and / illustrators hadn t even thought about! That is exactly how discoveries in science were made by someone just observing something new, something unusual in the world around them. This textbook is just a small guide, a map to find our way around the different paths ofscience. Never stop asking questions, and remember, your curiosity is the spark that lights the flame of exploration that will take you to incredible heights. And we ll | join you again, next year, for more adventures in science. 4/3/2025 4:57:32 PM Notes Chapter 12.indd 188 4/3/2025 4:57:32 PM
