When we view from the Earth, the Sun appears in the East, moves across the sky from the East to the West and disappears in the West. Does it indicate that the Sun is moving in the sky? Or might it be that the Earth itself is turning around and the Sun just appears to move? The fact is that the Sun appears to be moving because we view it from the Earth, which is turning around itself. Ds -* 4/3/2025 4:57:12 PM In which way is the Earth turning around itself? To visualise this, let us recall some of the objects which turn around themselves. Have you watched a top spinning around its spindle (Fig. 12.2a)? Or a spinning fan (Fig. 12.2b)? Or tried spinning a ball (Fig. 12.2c)? S28 Qa oo ' (a) @) ) Fig. 12.2: (a) A spinning top (b) A spinning fan (c) A spinning ball < < s a o = b-} < < = = td i Wi Earth's axis of In a similar manner, the Earth also spins (or rotation rotates) on its own axis in space as shown in Fig. 12.3. <1 No The Earth s axis of rotation passes through its ae geographic North Pole and the South Pole. The Earth completes one rotation in about 24 hours. When viewed from the top of the North Pole west/ (Fig. 12.3), the Earth is rotating in the anti-clockwise direction, that is, from West to East. Let us try to understand this with the help of a globe. You have used a globe in Grade 6 to represent the Earth and identified North Pole, South Pole, and Equator on it. You also learnt that its axis passed | >South Pole through its North and South poles (in the Grade 6 Social (SP) Science textbook Exploring Society India and Beyond). Fig. 12.3: Rotation of the Earth | Activity 12.2: Let us explore | > Usea globe to represent the Earth and place asmall sticker to mark your location on it (Fig. 12.4a). rth Pole (NP) + While viewing from above the North Pole, slowly rotate the globe on its axis in anti-clockwise direction. >, ~ Observe how your location turns around and finally comes back to its original position completing one rotation. Rotation is the motion of an object in which all its parts move in circles ; around an imaginary line that passes Fig. 12.4(a): Using a globe to through it. This line is called the axis | 4erstand rotation of the Earth of rotation. Chapter 12.indd 171 4/3/2025 4:57:14 PM - Useatorch to represent the Sun. Go to a relatively dark room to carry out the further steps of the activity. Let us now further explore to understand how day and night occur on the Earth due to its rotation. >, ~ Now, shine light from the torch placed at some distance, say 1.5 metres, on the globe as shown in Fig. 12.4b. Do you notice how half of the globe
