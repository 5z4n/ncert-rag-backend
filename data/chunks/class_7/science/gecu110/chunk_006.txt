not only serves as an instant source of energy but also later gets converted into starch for storage.

In India, Rustom Hormusji Dastur (1896-1961) studied the process of photosynthesis. He was a plant scientist and served as the head of the Botany Department at the Royal Institute of Science, Bombay (now the Institute of Science, Mumbai), from 1921-1935. He studied effects of the amount of water and temperature on photosynthesis. He examined the importance of water, temperature, and the colour of light in the process of photosynthesis. 10.2.4 How do leaves exchange gases during photosynthesis? We now know that photosynthesis requires carbon dioxide, and oxygen is released in the process. Which part of the plant helps in the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen? Let us conduct an activity to understand where the exchange of gases takes place.

Do you notice tiny pores on the peel, as shown in Fig. 10.6? These pores are called stomata. Stomata, present on the surface of leaves, help in the exchange of gases. 10.3 Transport in Plants a eS 10.3.1 Transport of water and minerals All living beings need water to grow. Plants use water in the process of photosynthesis. Water, along with minerals present in the soil, is taken up by the roots ofa plant. Minerals are important nutrients for the growth of plants. How do water and minerals taken up by the roots move to all parts of the plant? We can study water transport in plants by carrying out an activity. For this activity, we require two glass
