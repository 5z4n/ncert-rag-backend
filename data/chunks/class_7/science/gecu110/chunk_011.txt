a large transparent bottle (Fig. 10.13). After growing the plant properly for some time, seal the mouth of the bottle. Society Observe the growth of the Fig. 10.13: Bottle garden plant. If the plant is growing well that means the plant is maintaining the exchange of gases, that is, carbon dioxide produced in the process of respiration of the plant is utilised Economy for performing photosynthesis, and oxygen generated in photosynthesis is utilised in respiration by the plant inside the bottle. Howare plant processes like photosynthesis, respiration, and water and food transportation crucial for crop production? Visit a greenhouse, if there is one near your place. Observe how people grow plants in a green house. Find out how they regulate the amount of light, water, and carbon dioxide used to grow plants. Disciplinary >, ~ >, ~ KNOW A SCIENTIST Kamala Sohonie (1911-1998) was a woman scientist of India. She received a Ph.D. degree for her remarkable contribution in the area of respiration in plants from Cambridge University. She returned to India and worked at the Lady Hardinge Medical College in New Delhi, and later at the Nutrition Research Laboratory, Coonoor. Thereafter, she moved to the then Royal Institute of Science, Bombay, where she was eventually appointed as Director. Much of her work helped improve the nutritive values of plant foods. She also worked on the sap of the coconut palm as a nutritive drink called Neera. Chapter 10.indd 152 4/3/2025 4:55:59 PM
