to the flask? Lime water turns milky due to the presence of more carbon dioxide in the flask. But where does this carbon dioxide come from? As we know, carbon dioxide is naturally present in very small quantities in the air. In the flask, additional carbon dioxide is produced by the seeds as they respire. During respiration, glucose is broken down in the presence of oxygen, releasing carbon dioxide, water, and energy. The word equation for the proccess of respiration, is as follows Glucose + Oxygen > Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy The energy produced during respiration is used by plants for their growth and development. All parts of a plant, green or non-green, carry out respiration. Thus, plants have different mechanisms for synthesising, transporting, and utilising food to get energy. 4/3/2025 4:55:55 PM Ss oO mo] iC) ao 13) < uu n a] =) x . a = > U7) A) ss] = o NOT Chapter 10.indd 150 Gy ttAEEED Wat SHOULD In a Nutshell @eian coins) >, ~~ >, ~~ >, ~ >, ~ >, ~ >, ~ All living organisms require food that provide energy for their growth and development. Plants use carbon dioxide and water in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll to produce glucose and oxygen. This process of synthesis of food is known as photosynthesis. Leaves are the food factories of a plant. Tiny pores on the surface of leaves, called stomata, help in the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide during photosynthesis and respiration. The xylem transports water and minerals from roots, while the phloem carries food from leaves to all parts of the plants. Plants break down glucose and release energy by a process called respiration. They use oxygen and release carbon dioxide in this process. Let Us Enhance Our Learning 1. Complete the following table S.No. Feature Photosynthesis Respiration 1. Raw materials 2. Products 3. Word equation 4. Importance Imagine a situation where all the organisms that carry out photosynthesis on the earth have disappeared. What would be the impact of this on living organisms? A potato slice shows the presence of starch with iodine solution. Where does the starch in potatoes come from? Where is the food synthesised in the plant, and how does it reach the potato? Does the broad and flat structure of leaves make plants more efficient for photosynthesis? Justify your answer. X is broken down using Y to release carbon dioxide, Z, and energy. X+Y > Carbon dioxide + Z + Energy X, Y, and Z are three different components of the process. What do X, Y, and Z stand for? 4/3/2025 4:55:56 PM 6. Krishna set-up an experiment with two potted plants of same size and placed one of them in sunlight and the other in a dark room, as shown in Fig. 10.10. Answer the following questions (i) What idea might she be testing through this experiment? (ii) What are the visible differences in plants in both the conditions? (iii) According to you,
