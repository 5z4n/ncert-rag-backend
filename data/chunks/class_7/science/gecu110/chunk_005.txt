primary site for photosynthesis. Do other green parts of the plant also perform photosynthesis? Yes, other parts of the plants which have chlorophyll also perform photosynthesis. So far, we have learnt that plants take in carbon dioxide from the air and water, and use sunlight to prepare their food by the process of photosynthesis. But have you ever thought about what more happens during this process?

Let us explore this through an experiment performed by Barkha didi. Activity 10.5: Let us explore | * Look at Fig. 10.4.

What difference do you observe in the two set-ups? Do you observe air bubbles emerging in the inverted test tube in set-up A? The gas produced in this set-up caused bubbles to emerge and get accumulated in the inverted test tube. Which gas is this? it = Inverted test tube Funnel Water plant = ia Fig. 10.4: Activity showing the release of oxygen during photosynthesis Oh yes! Iremember. In our science lab, I have seen a similar set-up placed under sunlight near a window. When sufficient gas was accumulated in the inverted test tube, Barkha didi placed her thumb on the mouth of the test tube while taking the test tube off the set-up. She then quickly inserted a lit matchstick into the tube and the matchstick produced an intense flame. She inferred that the gas in the test tube is rich in oxygen. It indicates that oxygen is released during the process of photosynthesis. It also indicates that photosynthesis occurs in the presence of sunlight. Based on Barkha didi s experiment, we can conclude that oxygen is released during photosynthesis. Chapter 10.indd 145 4/3/2025 4:55:53 PM 10.2.3 Photosynthesis: ina nutshell Carbohydrates (Glucose) We know that water, sunlight, carbon dioxide from the air, and chlorophyll are necessary to carry out the process of photosynthesis that produces carbohydrates (Fig. 10.5). During photosynthesis, food is _ actually produced in the form of glucose, a simple carbohydrate. This glucose not only serves as an instant source of energy but also later gets converted into starch for storage. The word equation Light Chlorophyll pigment Carbon dioxide Water and minerals Fig. 10.5: A diagram showing of photosynthesis is given below photosynthesis Sunlight Carbon dioxide + Water - _ Glucose + Oxygen Chlorophyll KNOW A SCIENTIST Many scientists across the world contributed to develop an understanding of photosynthesis. In India, Rustom Hormusji Dastur (1896-1961) studied the process of photosynthesis. He was a
