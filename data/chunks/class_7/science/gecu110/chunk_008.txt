check for plants through the xylem (Fig. 10.8). The water P P transported through the xylem is used to perform Food transport various functions. How does food get transported through phloem to other parts of a plant? 10.3.2 Transport of food We know that leaves are the primary site for photosynthesis. The food prepared by plants in the leaves is transported to all parts of the plant. This food is transported through another set of thin tube-like structures called the phloem (Fig. 10.8). The transported food may also be stored in some other parts of a plant, such as seeds and roots.

Do plants also respire like we do? Activity 10.8: Let us find out demonstration activit > + Soak some moong bean seeds in water overnight. + Puta layer of cotton in a conical flask (Fig. 10.9) and moisten the cotton with water to keep it wet. + Place the soaked seeds over the wet cotton in the conical flask. + Cover the mouth of the conical flask with a cork having two holes. + Fit two tubes A and B through the two ne holes on the cork, as shown in Fig. 10.9. + Leave it undisturbed for 24 hours in the dark.

Compare both the test tubes for any change in colour. Does the lime water turn milky in both the test tubes? Why does the lime water turn milky in the test tube connected to the flask? Lime water turns milky due to the presence of more carbon dioxide in the flask. But where does this carbon dioxide come from? As we know, carbon dioxide is naturally present in very small quantities in the air. In the flask, additional carbon dioxide is produced by the seeds as they respire. During respiration, glucose is broken down in the presence of oxygen, releasing carbon dioxide, water, and energy. The word equation for the proccess of respiration,
