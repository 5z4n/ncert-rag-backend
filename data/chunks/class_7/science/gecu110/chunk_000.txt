Ly ZP In Grade 6, we learnt that all living beings grow and need food for their growth. Also, in the previous chapter, we discussed the process through which animals obtain nutrition. We know that animals eat food to grow, but what about plants? Have you ever seen plants eating food like animals do? As animals grow, their size and weight usually increase, and their bodies undergo various changes. What changes do you notice in plants when they grow? We learnt that food provides nutrients like carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, and minerals, which, along with water, are all essential for growth. Let us how plants obtain nutrients for their growth. desis ] . V oa Chapter 10.indd 137 4/3/2025 4:55:45 PM | Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 10.1 How Do Plants Grow? Look around your neighbourhood. Have you observed any changes in a plant during its life span? As a plant grows, new leaves and branches emerge, its height increases, and its stem thickens. What do you think causes these changes? Discuss with your friends and provide your explanation as well. When we water plants regularly, they grow better. So, I think water also contributes to its growth. I think sunlight plays some role in the growth of plants. Maybe plants take up food from the soil through their roots. I think, maybe, plays some role! Let us perform an experiment to test some of these explanations. | Activity 10.1: Let us test some explanations | + Take three earthen pots (or used bottles/containers) of the same size filled with garden soil. Plant saplings of similar sizes (a) Pot A kept in (b) Pot Bkept in (c) Pot C kept in direct sunlight, direct sunlight, the dark, with with water without water water Fig. 10.1: Experimental set-up to understand the role of sunlight and water in plant growth Chapter 10.indd 138 >, ~ >, ~ >, ~ >, ~ of a fast-growing plant like chilli or tomato in each pot (Fig. 10.1). Label the pots A, B, and C. Count the number of leaves on each sapling and record your observations. Place pot A in direct sunlight. Keep the soil in this pot slightly moist by adding an adequate amount of water every day (Fig. 10.1a). Place pot B in direct sunlight, without adding water to the soil (Fig. 10.1b). 4/3/2025 4:55:47 PM + Place pot C in the dark. Keep the soil in this pot slightly moist by adding an adequate amount of water every day (Fig. 10.1c). + Observe the plants for two weeks! and record changes in their height, number of leaves, colour of leaves, and any other changes that may appear. + Record your observations in Table 10.1.
