the bottle. Take a Y-shaped hollow tube, as shown in Fig. 9.9. Fix two deflated balloons to the forked end of the tube. Secure them with rubber bands to make them airtight. Insert the straight end of the tube | tightly through the lid from the @halation (b) Exhalation open base of the bottle and seal Fig. 9.9: Model to show the lid with clay to make it airtight. | echanisms of breathing To the open base of the bottle, attach a thin rubber sheet tightly using a large rubber band. >, ~ >, ~ >, ~ >, ~ >, ~ Pull the rubber sheet from the centre of the base downwards and watch the balloons (Fig. 9.9a). What do you observe? Now, release the rubber sheet upwards and observe the balloons (Fig. 9.9b). What changes do you see in the balloons? When you pull the rubber sheet downwards, the balloons inflate. Conversely, when you release the rubber sheet upwards, the balloons deflate. When you _ breathe in (inhale), your chest Ribs move expands as the ribs move Pe Outwards ps \ Ribsmove yp and outwards. The Ve diaphragm (a dome-shaped muscle below the lungs) moves downwards during inhalation (Fig. 9.10a). This increases the space inside the chest, and air enters the \ lungs. When you breathe Diaphragm moves downward Diaphragm moves upward out (exhale), the ribs move (a) Inhalation (b) Exhalation down and inwards, and the diaphragm moves upwards (Fig. 9.10b), reducing space and pushing air out of the lungs. Air is drawn in Air is forced out Fig. 9.10: Mechanism of breathing Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 Chapter 9.indd 130 4/3/2025 4:55:15 PM What do the balloons in the model mentioned in Fig. 9.9 represent? What does the rubber sheet represent? In this model, the balloons represent the lungs, and the rubber sheet represents the diaphragm. SCIENCE AND SOCIETY Breathing Practices for a Healthy Life Breathing exercises have been practised across different cultures in India and worldwide for centuries. Pranayama is well known for improving respiratory health, mind relaxation, and concentration. In Ladakh, people practise Tummo breathing, a technique that improves lung function and helps keep the body warm even in cold weather. Similarly, deep breathing techniques are used to promote well-being. Some traditions combine deep breathing with chanting, using rhythmic breath control to enhance relaxation and mental clarity.
