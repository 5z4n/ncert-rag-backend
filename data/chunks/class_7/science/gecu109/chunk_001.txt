What do you think is the role of saliva in your mouth? What do you feel when you eat other types of food, such as chapati? Let us find out. Take a small piece of chapati or a bite-sized portion of boiled rice and chew it properly for 30-60 seconds. At first, the chapati or rice has its usual taste, but as you continue chewing, do you notice a change in taste? The food begins to taste sweet! Have you ever wondered why this happens? Chapatior rice contains starch, whichis a type of carbohydrate. Our saliva contains a digestive juice that helps break down starch into sugar. This explains why starchy food, like chapati, tastes sweet when you chew it for a long time. Saliva helps to break down components of food into simpler ones.

We should brush our teeth and clean our tongue twice a day, and rinse our mouth with water after each meal to prevent tooth decay and bad smell in the mouth. Find out the ways our elders were maintaing oral hygiene. [ Activity 9.1: Let us investigate { Take two test tubes and label them as A and B . Take one teaspoonful of boiled rice in test tube A, and take a teaspoonful of boiled rice after chewing it for 30-60 seconds in test tube B. Add 3-4 mL of water in both the test tubes. Note the initial colour of the rice-water mixture in Table 9.1. Add 3-4 drops of iodine solution into each test tube with the help of a dropper. Mix the content of each test tube separately and observe. >, ~ <3 % >, ~ >, ~ >, ~ Record your observations in Table 9.1. | Table 9.1 9. 1: Action of saliva on starch Chapter 9.indd 123 4/3/2025 4:55:09 PM Did you observe that the colour of boiled rice turned blue-black in test tube A, while in test tube B, chewed boiled rice either did not change colour or turned only a very light blue-black colour? What causes the change of colour in test tube A? In Grade 6, we learned that iodine gives a blue-black colour when it reacts with starch. In test tube A, the appearance of the blue-black colour indicates the presence of starch. In test tube B, which contains chewed boiled rice, if there is no change in colour, it indicates that the starch is no longer present; if there is only a slight change in colour, it indicates that starch is present only
