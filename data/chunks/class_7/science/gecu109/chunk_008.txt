explore | To be demonstrated by the teacher + Take an equal amount of freshly prepared lime water in two Pichkari test tubes, A and B, as given in Fig. 9.11. Straw straw * In test tube A, pass the air using a syringe/pichkari (Fig. 9.11a). This is the same air that you containing containing inhale. lime water lime water + In test tube B, repeatedly blow (a) b air through your mouth into ) the lime water using a straw Fig. 9.11: (a) Air is passed into lime water with a (Fig. 9.11b). pichkari/syringe (b) Air is exhaled into lime water + Do you observe any changes in the colour of the lime water? The lime water in test tube B turns milky (or cloudy), but the lime water in test tube A does not. What does this indicate? Lime water turns milky when it reacts with carbon dioxide. Therefore, this indicates that the exhaled air contains more carbon dioxide than the air we inhale.

Through the process of breathing, fresh air from outside enters the lungs and fills the alveoli. The alveoli have thin walls surrounded by fine tubes containing blood (Fig. 9.12). Blood carries carbon dioxide from the body to the alveoli, where it is Blood vessel Alveolus released into the air. At the same time, oxygen from the alveoli passes Fig. 9.12: Gas exchange through alveoli into the blood and is transported to all parts of the body. Have you ever wondered how the food you eat gives you energy? The key is not only the food but also the oxygen we breathe! When we eat food, our body breaks it down into simple substances like sugar (glucose). Oxygen helps break down glucose to release energy. This process is called respiration. The word equation of the process of respiration is as follows Glucose + Oxygen Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy During breathing, we inhale air from our surroundings and alee aig, exhale air having more carbon dioxide than the inhaled air. Note that not all the oxygen Nearly45% 4S used up (Fig. 9.13). carbon dioxide Some other animals can use a_ larger fraction of the oxygen during respiration. = _ -_ 1 J Exhaled air _ Fig. 9.13: The percentage of oxygen and carbon This exchange of gases dioxide in inhaled and exhaled air ensures that each segment of our body gets oxygen to produce energy and remove waste products. In simple words, breathing brings in oxygen and removes carbon dioxide, while respiration uses oxygen to break down food and release energy. This energy helps us walk, run, play, and even think! Breathing is a physical process, while respiration is a chemical process that occurs inside the body. Both
