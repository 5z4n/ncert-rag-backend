torch or a flashlight. [Activity 3.1: Let us explore | Take a torchlight similar to the one shown in Fig. 3.1. Observe it carefully. Do you notice a lamp? And a switch? Slide its switch and observe. Does the torch lamp glow? Now slide the switch back to its original position and observe the torch lamp. Fig. 3.1: A torchlight You might have noticed that in the first position of the switch, the torch lamp glows and in the other position the lamp does not glow. + Now, open the torchlight. What do you find inside? >, >, >, ome Oe Oe , % Inside the torchlight, you may find two or more electric cells. Why does the torch lamp glow in one position of its switch?

Do you notice a positive (+) sign and a negative ( ) sign marked on the + i electric cell? Do you also notice that it has a small protruding metal cap on one side and a flat metal disc on the other side? Allelectric cells have two terminals; one is called positive (+ ve) while the other is negative (-ve). The metal cap is the positive terminal of the electric cell and the metal disc is the negative terminal. The electric cell is a portable source of electrical energy. 3.2.2 Battery Fig. 3.2: An electric cell a Cd < C7) < [-] a [-) U = 7) r= Cd GS < a Vv = U x i td .*] a Wu In a torch, we generally use more than one cell. Are those placed in any particular order? [ Activity 3.3: Let us experiment | + Take a torch which uses two cells. Open its cell compartment and take out the cells. + Put the cells back in a different order. Also, try reversing the direction of one cell. Then, slide the switch and check whether the lamp glows in each case. + Check the order in which the cells were placed in the torch when the lamp glows. The lamp glows when the cells are placed in the order as shown in Fig. 3.3. Notice how the terminals of the two cells are connected. The positive terminal of one cell is connected to the negative terminal of the next cell. Such a combination of two or more cells is called a battery.
