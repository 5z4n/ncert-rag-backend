or negative terminal of the cell. The lamp will glow as long as Fig. 3.9: Anelectrical circuit the circuit is complete and current flows through the filament. FASCINATING FACTS Sometimes, an incandescent lamp does not glow even when = connected to a cell. We say the lamp has fused usually due to a broken filament. A broken filament stops the flow of current, preventing the lamp from glowing. Let us now try to make an LED glow. | Activity 3.7: Let us experiment | + Take two electric cells, an LED of any colour, a cell holder that can fit two cells (Fig. 3.8a), and two lengths of electric wire. + Remove about 1 cm of the plastic covering from both ends of each wire to expose the metal. > Connect the two wires to the cell holder as shown in Fig. 3.10a. 4/3/2025 4:51:32 PM Chapter 3.indd 31 * Insert two cells in the holder, taking care that for each cell, its negative terminal is towards the spring side of the holder (Fig. 3.10b) and the battery is ready to use. How will you decide which is the positive terminal of this battery? P| The terminal ofthe holder whichisconnected | to the positive terminal of one cell is positive and the one connected to the negative terminal of the other cell is the negative terminal. [ + Now, connect the free end of the battery positive terminal wire to the longer wire of (a) LED, and the free end of the second wire to the shorter wire of LED (Fig. 3.10c). Does the LED glow? Repeat the above step but interchange the wires connected to the LED (Fig. 3.10d). Does the LED glow again? You would have observed that the LED glows in the first case (Fig. 3.10c) and does not glow in the other (Fig. 3.10d). It is because the current can pass through the LED in one direction only. The current passes through the LED only when the positive terminal (longer wire) of the LED is connected to the positive terminal of the battery, and negative terminal (shorter wire) of the LED >, ~ is connected to the negative terminal of the (c) battery. When current passes through the LED, it glows. Always take care to connect an LED Fig. 3.10: Making an LED glow correctly in a circuit to make it glow. Sometimes you may come across a device in which the cells are placed side by side. Then, how are the terminals of the cells connected? ( the battery compartment, you will usually see a thick wire or metal strip connecting the positive terminal of one cell to the negative terminal of the next.
