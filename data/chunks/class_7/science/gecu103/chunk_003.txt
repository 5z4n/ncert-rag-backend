has a different kind of lamp. In fact, it cannot be taken out of the torch as it is fixed in it. 4/3/2025 4:51:27 PM -_ _ = a on \ ay, LED Lamp Many torches in use today have a Light Emitting Diode (LED) lamp, instead of an incandescent lamp, as shown in Fig. 3.5. LED lamp Fig. 3.5: An LED lamp for torch [Activity 3.5: Let us observe | * Take an LED of any colour (Fig. 3.6) and observe. Do you see any filament inside it? wn Cd < C7) < [-] a E [-) s) = 7) r= Cd GS < wn Vv = s 2 i td .*] c) Ww + Notice the length of two wires attached to , the LED. Do you find one of those longer than the other? Unlike incandescent lamps, LEDs do not have filaments (Fig. 3.6). They also have two terminals, but one is positive (attached to a longer wire) and the other is negative (the shorter wire). A torch may use one or more Fig. 3.6: LEDs of different colours LEDs, sometimes of different shapes, in its lamp. After having learnt about the electric cell, battery, and electric lamps, we are now ready to make the torch lamp glow using an electric cell or battery. 3.2.4 Making an electric lamp glow using an electric cell or battery | Activity 3.6: Let us construct | * Take an electric cell, an incandescent lamp used in a torch, a cell holder, a lamp holder, and four lengths of electric wire. ae >, ~ Remove about 1 cm of the plastic covering from both ends of each wire to expose the metal. >, ~ Attach two wires to the two ends of the cell holder as shown in Fig. 3.7a.

In case a cell holder is not available, fix the two wires to the cell using electrical tape (Fig. 3.7c). >, ~ Attach two wires to the screws of the lamp holder as shown in Fig. 3.8a. Fix the lamp in the holder by turning it around in the holder (Fig. 3.8b). In case a lamp holder is not available, use electrical tape to attach two wires to the two ends of the lamp (Fig. 3.8c). / \ (a) (b) (c) Fig. 3.8: (a) An electric lamp holder with wires attached (b) An incandescent lamp inside the lamp holder (c) Wires connected to incandescent torch lamp with electrical tape Now, we are ready to connect the cell to the lamp to make it glow. + We will conduct this activity in two parts prediction and observation.
