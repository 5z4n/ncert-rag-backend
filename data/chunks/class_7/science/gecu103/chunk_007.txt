The two arrows indicate that light is emitted by an LED (Fig. 3.13b).

[Activity 3.10: Let us draw | + Using symbols shown in Table 3.2, draw the circuit diagram of an electrical circuit given in Fig. 3.12a and Fig. 3.10c. Are your circuit diagrams similar to Fig. 3.14a and Fig. 3.14b respectively? ay (a () Fig. 3.14: A circuit diagram (a) with an incandescent lamp (b) with an LED lamp 1 Ive > Iternational organisations, such as the International \ EEPER ) Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), American National _--~ Standards Institute (ANSJ), and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) create standard symbols for electrical and electronic parts. Using the same symbols across the world helps people from different countries and industries understand each other easily. _ 3.4 Electrical Conductors and Insulators Why did we use metal wires for making electric circuits? Can we not use some other materials for wires? Also, why are electric wires covered with plastic or rubber? 4/3/2025 4:51:42 PM _ ee Suppose, we make wires of materials other than metal and use them for making the electrical circuit. Do you think the electric current will pass through those materials in such a circuit? | Activity 3.11: Let us identify | Connect an electric cell and a lamp while leaving the two ends of wires free as shown (a) in Fig. 3.15a. Touch the two free ends of the wires momentarily. Does the lamp glow? If yes, our tester is ready. We can use this tester to identify the materials through which electric current passes.
