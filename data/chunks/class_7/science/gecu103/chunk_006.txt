Does the lamp glow? + Rotate the free end of the safety pin till it touches the other drawing pin as shown in Fig. 3.8b. Does the lamp glow now? cy When the safety pin touches both drawing @ pins, it closes the gap and completes the path, and allows the current to flow. We call this the ON position (Fig. 3.8b) where the circuit is closed and current flows from the cell s positive to negative terminal making the lamp glow. When the safety pin does not touch the second drawing pin, the gap in the circuit prevents current flow, and the lamp does not glow. In this OFF position (Fig. 3.8a), we say that the circuit is open. Note that a switch can be placed anywhere in (b) a circuit. A switch is a simple device that either completes or breaks a circuit.
