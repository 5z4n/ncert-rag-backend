(ii) A switch helps to complete or break the circuit. (iii) Aswitchhelps us to use electricity as per our requirement. (iv) When the switch is in OFF position, there is an air gap between its terminals. 2. Observe Fig. 3.16. With which material connected between the ends A and B, the lamp will not glow? Fig. 3.16 Chapter 3.indd 37 4/3/2025 4:51:45 PM 3. In Fig. 3.17, if the filament of one of the lamps is broken, will the other glow? Justify your answer. Fig. 3.17 4. A student forgot to remove the insulator covering from the connecting wires while making a circuit. If the lamp and the INNOVATION cell are working properly, will the lamp glow? ; 5. Draw a circuit diagram for a simple torch using symbols for Discovery electric components. 6. In Fig. 3.18: ENQUIRY (i) If S, is in ON position, S, is in OFF position, which lamp(s) will glow? EXPLORATION (ii) If S, is in OFF position, S, is in ON position, which lamp(s) will glow? (iii) If S, and S, both are in ON position, which lamp(s) will glow? (iv) If both S, and S, are in OFF position, which lamp(s) will glow? Fig. 3.18 7. Vidyut has made the circuit as shown in Fig. 3.19. Even after closing the circuit, the lamp does not glow. What can be the possible reasons? List as many possible reasons as you can for this faulty operation. What will you do to find out why the lamp did not glow?

Suppose the + and ~ symbols cannot be read on a battery. Suggest a method to identify the two terminals of this battery. 10. You are given six cells marked A, B, C, D, E, and F. Some of these are working and some are not. Design an activity to identify which of them are working. (i) List the items that you require. (ii) Write the procedure that you will follow. (iii) With the items, carry out the activity to identify the cells that are working. 11. An LED requires two cells in series to glow. Tanya made the circuit as shown in Fig. 3.21. Will the lamp glow? If not, draw the wires for correct connections.
