For example, in Ladakh, people have developed innovative ways to conserve water by making ice stupas (Fig. 7.13) during the winters. SCIENCE AND SOCIETY Ice Stupa During the spring season in Ladakh, streams often dry up, leading to scarcity of water as the heat from the Sun s radiation is not enough to melt the snow on the mountains. During winters, water from mountain streams is channeled down through underground pipes. This water is then sprayed into the cold air. As it falls, it Fig. 7.13: Ice stupa freezes due to extremely low temperatures. The ice builds up layer by layer, creating a tall, cone-shaped structure called an ice stupa as shown in Fig. 7.13. The ice stupa melts slowly during spring, providing water for farming and other needs throughout the summer. Heat Transfer in Nature In a Nutshell Oe eg + There are three ways in which heat is transferred from one place to another conduction, convection, and radiation. > >, ~ The process of heat transfer from the hotter part of an object to a colder part is called conduction. In this process, particles do not move from their positions. + Materials that allow heat to pass through them easily are called good conductors of heat. > >, ~ Materials that do not allow heat to pass through them easily are called poor conductors (insulators) of heat. >, ~ In solids, heat is mainly transferred through the process of conduction. In liquids and gases, heat is transferred by the process of convection.

Fig. 7.14: Saucepan Fig. 7.15: transfer set-up Burning candle Heat In convection, heat transfer takes place by the actual movement of particles. Land and sea breezes are examples of the process of convection. Heat from the Sun reaches the Earth through radiation. All objects exchange heat with their surroundings through the process of radiation. Processes of conduction and convection require a medium for heat transfer but no medium is required for the radiation process. The principles of heat transfer are utilised in designing houses and clothing. The continuous movement of water upward as water vapour and downward through precipitation, passing through soil, rocks and plants, and finally returning to water bodies, is called water cycle. The process of surface water seeping through soil and rocks is called infiltration. Groundwater is the water that seeps through and gets stored in the pore spaces of
