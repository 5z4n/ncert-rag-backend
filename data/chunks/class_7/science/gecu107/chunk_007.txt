like oceans and lakes. Let us look at the phenomenon of water cycle to understand this in more detail. 7.4 Water Cycle Op You have also learnt in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity, that water exists in three states in nature. As a liquid, it fills the oceans, rivers, and lakes on the Earth. As a solid, it forms snow, ice sheets, and glaciers in the mountains and the polar regions. As a gas, it exists in the form of water vapour in the Earth s atmosphere. During summers, some of the snow and ice gets converted to water due to the Sun s radiation and flows down as rivers, and ultimately into the oceans. The melted ice is replenished by fresh snow during winters. Water in the oceans, rivers, and lakes gets ul heated due to the Sun, and &h\ \ ; as a result, it evaporates as water vapour. Water al f UAV 8 y= also evaporates from a Show. trees and plants through transpiration. When water vapour rises up, it cools down and condenses to form clouds. Clouds bring rain, snow, and _ hail. This process is called Fig. 7.9: Water cycle precipitation. The continuous movement of water upward as water vapour and downward through precipitation, passing through soil, rocks, and plants, and finally returning to water bodies, is called water cycle (Fig. 7.9). Thus, the water cycle helps in redistributing and replenishing water in rivers, lakes, and oceans. It also serves to conserve the total amount of water on the Earth. Rainwater that falls on the surface of the Earth, flows into ponds, lakes, rivers, and oceans or seeps into the ground. Ds Chapter 7.indd 98 4/3/2025 4:54:04 PM Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 KNOW A SCIENTIST Varahamihira was an astronomer and mathematician of the Ai sixth century CE in Ujjaini (modern-day Ujjain), Madhya Pradesh. =~ In his work Brihatsamhita, he gave methods for predicting seasonal rainfall. His predictions of seasonal rainfalls were based on factors, such as cloud formation, wind patterns, position of stars and the moon, and other natural phenomena. You may have seen people drawing water from wells or handpumps. This is the water that has seeped into the ground. Let us understand how water seeps through the surface of the earth by performing an activity.
