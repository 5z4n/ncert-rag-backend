You may have observed that water seeps fastest through gravel, slower through sand, and slowest through clay. Why is it so? The spaces between gravel particles are wider when compared to those in sand and clay. Hence, water can seep through the gravel more easily. In this way, water seeps beneath the surface of the Earth. This process of surface water seeping through soil and rocks is called infiltration. Water can infiltrate more readily if the spaces between soil and rock particles are wider, open, and interconnected (Fig. 7.11). The water that seeps through gets stored in the pore spaces of sediments and the openings in rocks beneath the surface as groundwater. The underground layers of sediments and rocks that store water in pore spaces are called aquifers (Fig. 7.12). This is the water we extract by digging wells or drilling bore wells into aquifers. This water may be a few metres to hundreds of metres below the ground, depending Fig. 7.11: Water readily on the location. moves, and is stored where spaces are wide, open and connected Open spaces Gravel Soil Infiltration Aquifer Fig. 7.12: Aquifer However, groundwater is not unlimited. The growing water requirements of an increasing population have led to excessive groundwater extraction. Additionally, decreased vegetation cover and increased concrete surfaces in urban areas have limited water infiltration. As a result, groundwater is getting depleted. To address this, rainwater harvesting and recharge pits are used to replenish groundwater. Hence, the water cycle ensures that groundwater sources are recharged, thereby helping to ensure a sustainable groundwater supply.

For example, in Ladakh, people have developed innovative ways to conserve water by making ice stupas (Fig. 7.13) during the winters. SCIENCE AND SOCIETY Ice Stupa During
