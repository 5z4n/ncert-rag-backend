In this case, the entire volume of water gets heated through the actual movement of water particles. This process of heat transfer is known as convection. It is because of convection that we see the movement of the coloured streak inside the beaker. Thus, we can conclude that water, like air, gets heated up by the process of convection. Here, heat transfer takes place by the actual movement of particles of liquids and gases from one place to another. 7.2.1 Land and Sea Breeze Palden shares his experience of visiting a beach in Kerala during winter vacation and says, During the day, the sand or soil near the beach is hotter than the water in the sea. However, at night, the sand or soil is cooler than the water. Pema replies, Yes, different objects get heated and cooled differently. Let us check how land and water get heated and cooled by performing an activity. [Activity 7.4: Let us investigate | A\ Caution This activity should be carried out on a clear, Stand Thermometer > eal - ~&.. Ne Soi Water =~ sunny day under the supervision of a teacher or an adult. >, ~ Take two identical bowls as shown in Fig. 7.6. Fill one bowl halfway with soil and the other bowl halfway with water. Fix a laboratory thermometer in each bowl as shown in Fig. 7.6. Make sure that the bulbs of the thermometer are immersed in soil and water, and do not touch the bottoms or the sides of the bowls. Place the set-up in sunlight. >, ~ >, ~ >, ~ 4/3/2025 4:54:01 PM Chapter 7.indd 95 ** Measure the temperature of soil and water every 5 minutes and record the data in Table 7.4.

After 20 minutes, you will find that the temperature of the soil rises more than that of the water. This indicates that the soil heats up faster than water. Does the soil also cool faster than water? After letting the soil and water get heated, bring the set-up indoors and let it cool for 20 minutes. You will observe that the soil cools faster than water, just as it gets heated faster. People living in _ coastal areas experience an interesting phenomenon caused by _ the heating and cooling of land and water at different rates. As the land gets heated faster than water
