Chapter 4.indd 41 . The World of Metals and Non-metals Yashwant and Anandi live in a village in Rajasthan. Their school has assigned them a project to learn about craftspersons who work with metals. They decide to visit the local ironsmiths who practise this craft. Yashwant and Anandirequest their grandfather to accompany them (Fig. 4.1). They are curious to learn how these ironsmiths make different items of daily use. They interact with an elderly craftsperson, Sudarshan uncle. Yashwant: Which items do you generally make? Sudarshan: Generally, we make items of daily use, such as flat pans (tawas), buckets (baltis), tongs (chimtas), and farming tools like spades (phawras), axes (kulhadis), trowels (khurpis), and rakes (jelees). Anandi: What materials are they made of? 0777CHO4 4/3/2025 4:52:08 PM Sudarshan: We use iron metal to make these items. We also use wood to prepare handles wherever required. Additionally, we use coal in our furnaces to heat the iron. Sudarshan is heating an iron block in the furnace. It has become red hot. He starts beating it hard with a hammer. Anandi is amazed and asks, Why are you beating it? Sudarshan: I am beating it to shape it into an axe. Anandi: Wow, a piece of iron can be beaten into a flat shape! Can we do this with other metals as well? You may also have many such questions let us explore what else we can do with metals. 4.1 Properties of Materials CSSSES SNS ooo oo oe OY 4.1.1 Malleability | Activity 4.1: Let us explore | /\ Caution Conduct this activity under the supervision of your teacher or an adult. + Collect some waste pieces of copper and aluminium, an iron nail, a piece of coal, a pea-sized lump of sulfur (gandhak), and a block of wood. * Recall the chapter Materials Around Us in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity and observe the appearances of the above items. Are they lustrous? Also, note whether they are hard or soft and record your observations in Table 4.1. ae + Now, place each of these items one by one on any hard surface and beat them with a hammer (Fig. 4.2). * What do you think will happen? Do the _ objects become slightly flattened or do they break into pieces? * Record your observations in Table 4.1.
