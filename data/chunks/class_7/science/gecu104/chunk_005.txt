In which conditions would an iron object develop brown deposits? + When it comes into contact with dry air only. + When it comes into contact with water only. we te * When it comes into contact with both air and water.

If you are using old iron nails, make sure to remove brown deposits from their surface by scrubbing them with the help of a small piece of sandpaper. Take three clean, dry glass bottles or test tubes with tight-fitting caps or stoppers. Label them A, B, and C. Take three iron nails and tie each iron nail with a thread. Place one iron nail and some silica gel in the glass bottle A , and tighten the cap or stopper (Fig. 4.4a). Silica gel makes the air dry. It is the substance that is used in small pouches in some medicine bottles, water bottles, shoe boxes, etc., to keep them dry. Place one iron nail in the glass bottle B . Pour freshly boiled and cooled water (to remove dissolved gases) into it until the iron nail is completely dipped in it. Now, pour some oil to form a layer over the surface of the water (Fig. 4.4b). The layer of oil on the surface of the water prevents the air from dissolving in the water. Cap the glass bottle tightly. Place one iron nail in the glass bottle C , and pour some water so that the iron nail is partially dipped. Keep this glass bottle unstoppered. This allows the iron nail to come into contact with both water and air, as shown in Fig. 4.4c. Place all the glass bottles undisturbed at room temperature and observe the changes for 8-10 days. Record your observations in Table 4.3.

It is observed in glass bottles A and B that the iron nails do not show any brown deposits. What does this observation indicate? This indicates that brown deposits or discolouration on the iron nails do not develop when the iron nail is kept in dry air alone (bottle A) or water alone (bottle B). However, in glass bottle C, the iron nail shows the presence of
