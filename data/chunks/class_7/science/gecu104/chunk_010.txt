You are provided with the following materials. Discuss which material would be your choice to make a pan that is most suitable for boiling water and why? Iron copper sulfur coal plastic wood cardboard 9. You are provided with three iron nails, each dipped in oil, water and vinegar. Which iron nail will not rust, and why? 10. How do the different properties of metals and non-metals determine their uses in everyday life? 11. One of the methods of protecting iron from getting rusted is to put a thin coating of zinc metal over it. Since sulfur does not react with water, can it be used for this purpose? Justify your answer. 12. An ironsmith heats iron before making tools. Why is heating necessary in this process?
