difference in the sound produced by these objects? Chapter 4.indd 45 4/3/2025 4:52:13 PM You would observe that the metal spoon and the metal coin produce a ringing sound. Coal and wood, on the other hand, produce dull sounds. This property of metals that enables them to produce a ringing sound is called sonority, and metals are said to be sonorous in nature. Now, I understand! The ringing sound Oh! The ringing sound of my ghungroos is also due to the sonority of metals. of the school bell is due to the sonority of metals. 4.1.4 Conduction of heat Have you ever observed the vessels used for cooking in the kitchen? You might have noticed that the vessels used for heating are made of metals. Can you name some metals that are used for making cooking vessels? Do you know why these metals are used for this purpose? Let us find out! | Activity 4.3: Let us investigate | /\ Caution This activity must be performed under the supervision of your teacher or an adult. Be careful while handling hot water. , % * Place a glass tumbler on a table. Fill it with hot water. Take a metal spoon and a wooden spoon of almost the same size and thickness. >, ~ >, ~ >, ~ Immerse both the spoons simultaneously into the hot water (Fig. 4.3) and leave them undisturbed for a few minutes. Fig. 4.3: Metal and wooden spoons + Now, carefully touch the upper end immersed in hot water of each spoon. Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 Chapter 4.indd 46 4/3/2025 4:52:14 PM = eer ~\ a : a Some discussion points: + Which of the spoons get hotter? + What does this experiment tell us about heat transfer along the two spoons? You may have noticed that the metal spoon is hotter to touch than the wooden spoon. Even though both spoons are immersed in the water of the same temperature and for the same time. This shows that the heat transfers through the metal spoon, making it hotter. In contrast, the wooden spoon transfers heat poorly. In such cases, the transfer of heat from one point to another of a material is called conduction, and materials that transfer heat are called conductors. Based on the observations, one can say that metals are good conductors of heat, whereas wood is a poor conductor of heat. Now, we can understand why mostly metal vessels are used for cooking, and their handles are made with wood or other materials that do not conduct heat. You will learn more about this in the chapter Heat Transfer in Nature .
