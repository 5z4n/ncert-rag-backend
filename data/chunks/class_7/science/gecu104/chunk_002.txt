it took a long time before iron was used in day-to-day activities. However, once the use of iron gained prominence in the times that followed, it contributed significantly to the progress of civilisation in Ss India. For instance, due to its strength, agricultural tools like ploughs vant made from iron were much superior to those used previously. 1 What could be the potential reason that it is generally considered =< that copper was discovered earlier as compared to iron? 4.1.2 Ductility Where do you find the use of metal wires? You might have seen wires of metals like copper or aluminium in electrical fittings. Some ornaments, like bangles, necklaces, earrings, etc., are also made from metal wires. Metal wires play important functions in a variety of stringed musical instruments, such as veena, sitar, violin, and guitar. This property of materials by which they can be drawn into wires is called ductility. This property of ductility is mainly possessed by metals. The ductile nature of metals enables for the creation of this tea strainer {2g with metal wire. Gold is so _ ductile that one gram of it can be drawn into a 2 kilometre-long wire!

Chapter 4.indd 45 4/3/2025 4:52:13 PM You would observe that the metal spoon and the metal coin produce a ringing sound. Coal and wood, on the other hand, produce dull sounds. This property of metals that enables them to produce a ringing sound is called sonority, and metals are said to be sonorous in nature. Now, I understand! The ringing sound Oh! The ringing sound of my ghungroos is also due to
