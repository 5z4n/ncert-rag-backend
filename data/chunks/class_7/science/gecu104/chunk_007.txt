Fig. 4.5: Burning magnesium ribbon >, ~ You must have observed that magnesium ribbon burns with a dazzling white flame and changes into a white powder. Collect it on a watch glass. This powder is magnesium oxide. It is formed due to the reaction between magnesium and oxygen present in the air. >, ~ Add a few drops of warm water to this white powder, stir it well, and check its nature. >, ~ Recall the chapter Exploring Substances: Acidic, Basic, and Neutral . Find out whether the solution of magnesium oxide is acidic or basic or neutral in nature. You can use any acid-base indicator. Blue litmus paper Red litmus paper >, ~ What effect does this solution have on blue and red litmus papers? You would observe that it changes the colour of red litmus paper to blue (Fig. 4.6); hence, it is basic in nature. Generally, oxides of metals are basic in \ nature.

A lot of heat is generated in the reaction. Storing sodium in kerosene prevents its exposure to moisture and air. Can you predict the nature of its oxide? Let us now discuss some substances that do not behave like metals. 4.4 Substances that Behave Differently from Metals in Air and Water Fig. 4.7(a): Deflagrating spoon >, ~~ >, ~ Fig. 4.7(b): Improvised deflagrating spoon ve ~ >, ~ << Gas jar Sulfur > i, Fig. 4.7(c): Burning of sulfur ) OF >, ~ \ Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 = _ Chapter 4.indd 52 (Cp ehhh hhh hhh halle Ad deed dedlci hd lela de thctitdadehedided taal) Activity 4.7: Let us experiment (demonstration activity) The teacher may demonstrate this activity. Caution This activity must be performed in a fume hood or well-ventilated area. Burning sulfur produces gases, which can be harmful if inhaled. Take a small amount of powdered sulfur in a deflagrating spoon (it is a long-handled metal spoon used in experiments to safely heat and burn substances Fig. 4.7a). If a deflagrating spoon is not available, you may take a metallic cap of any bottle, wrap a metallic wire around it and give it the shape as shown in Fig. 4.7b. Heat it on a flame, and as soon as the sulfur starts burning, introduce the deflagrating
