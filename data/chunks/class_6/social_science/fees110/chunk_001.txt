that makes the rules and ensures that they are followed is called a government. Some of the more important rules are called laws. This does not mean that rules and laws are set once and for all. Just as you might discuss a particular rule at home with your parents, or as a student body might ask the school or Reprint 2025-26 03-02-2025 05:03:23 | university management to change a rule, citizens also have a say in the laws and rules governing the society. We will see how this takes place. 10 Grassroots Democracy - Part 1 Fig. 10.1 @ Reprint 2025-26 chapter10_310125.indd 151 & 03-02-2025 05:09:23 | | | 03-02-2025 05:03:30 | Fig. 10.2 Reprint 2025-26 Ades.0wWaq pue adueUsaA0H puoAsg pue eipuy :A3a190S Hulsojdx3 chapter10_310125.indd 152 LET'S EXPLORE > Can you identify the categories of public service or other activities that are represented in the ten pictures in Fig. 10.2 on page 152? > What role do you think the government plays in each of these activities? > Can you think of other aspects of your daily life where the government plays an important role? Three Organs of Government All over the world, digital technologies have been transforming the way societies function. In India, till about 30 years ago, people who wanted to transfer money to a distant relative would have to queue up at the Post Office to send a money order after filling up a form; or if they had to send a payment to some business, they would queue up at their bank to obtain a demand draft, which would then have to be sent by post. You have probably never heard these terms ( money order or demand draft ), because today we have digital means of sending across money instantly! However, this has also created a new class of criminals who, without even leaving their desks, find digital ways of stealing people s money. This has led many governments to pass new laws in order to fight such criminal activities (called cybercrime ). Some of those criminals, who believe in robbing innocent people of their hard-earned money instead of using their skills to contribute to the society, have been arrested and convicted in court. They are usually fined as well as jailed for some years. Through this example, we can see how the three branches or organs of a government work together: 10 Grassroots Democracy - Part 1 = The legislature is the organ that makes new laws (or legislates ). Sometimes it also updates or removes Reprint 2025-26 chapter10_310125.indd 153 & 03-02-2025 05:03:20 | Exploring Society: India and Beyond Governance and Democracy chapter10_310125.indd 154 In a good system of governance, these three organs must be kept separate, although they interact with each other and work together. This separation is called the separation of powers (Fig. 10.3). It is intended to provide a system of checks and balances. This EXECUTIVE means that each organ of the government can check what the other is doing
