This separation is called the separation of powers (Fig. 10.3). It is intended to provide a system of checks and balances. This EXECUTIVE means that each organ of the government can check what the other is doing and restore balance if Fig. 10.3 one organ acts beyond its expected role. existing laws. This is done by an assembly of representatives of the people. We will soon see how the Indian system works. The executive is the organ that implements (or executes ) the laws. This includes the head of state (who may be a president, a prime minister or a chief minister), the ministers and any agency responsible for enforcing law and order . (In our example above, that agency is the cyber police.) The judiciary is the system of courts which decides whether someone has broken the law and, if so, what course of action should be taken, including punishment if necessary. Sometimes it also examines whether a decision taken by the executive is right, or whether a law passed by the legislature is well conceived and fair to all. LET'S EXPLORE Explain how the three government organs are at work in the case of the cybercriminals described above. How do they intervene?

Can you describe any such real-life situation you may have heard of? Three Levels of Government Any government operates at two levels at the least local and national. In many countries, including India, it functions at three levels or tiers local, state or regional, and national. Each level deals with different matters. To use a comparison, if a bulb in your home is not lighting up, you will first check the bulb, switch, fuse, etc. If that does not work, you may call an electrician, and if it is found that the problem is not within your home, you may need to go to the Electricity Board and file a complaint. These are also three levels of dealing with a problem. chapter10_310125.indd 155 at the national level CENTRAL GOVERNMENT STATE at the GOVERNMENT State level LOCAL at the town or GOVERNMENT village level Fig. 10.4 Reprint 2025-26 10 Grassroots Democracy - Part 1 03-02-2025 05:03:31 | Exploring Society: India and Beyond Governance and Democracy chapter10_310125.indd 156 4 DON'T MISS OUT In India, we have local governments, State governments, and Central or Union government (Fig. 10.4 on page 155). Imagine that following heavy rain for a few days, there is a flood in a part of a district. If it is not too severe, the local authorities may
