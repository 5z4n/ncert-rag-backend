and culture has had its own ways of measuring time. Major events, such as the birth of an important person or the start of a ruler s reign, have often marked the beginning of a new era. At present, the Gregorian Reprint 2025-26 chapter4_310125.indd 61 & Fossils: Impressions of footprints, or parts of plants or animals that are found preserved within layers of soil or rocks. Era: A distinct period of time. 4 Timeline and Sources of History 03-02-2025 04:57:15 | Exploring Society: India and Beyond Tapestry of the Past Gregorian calendar: The calendar now used the world over; it has 12 months adding up to 365 days, and a leap year every four years. However, century years for example, 1800, 1900, 2000 are leap years only if they are multiples of 400; so in the three centenary years above, only 2000 is a leap year. Auspicious: favourable or bringing luck; for instance, an auspicious beginning . | chapter4_310125.indd 62 calendar is commonly used worldwide; side by side, Hindu, Muslim, Jewish, Chinese and other calendars are also used for calculating the dates of festivals and other auspicious events. In the West, the conventional year for Jesus Christ s birth has generally been taken to be the starting point for this calendar. Years are counted forward from this point and used to be marked with AD (an abbreviation for a Latin phrase that refers to the years after Jesus birth). However, this is now called the Common Era or CE across the world. For example, 1947, the year India gained independence, can be written as 1947 AD (sometimes AD 1947) or 1947 CE. Similarly, the years before the conventional date for the birth of Jesus are counted backward and used to be marked with BC (or Before Christ). They are now called Before Common Era or BCE. For example, 560 BCE is an approximate year of birth of Gautama Buddha (whom we First examples of rock art in the world Ice Age i Fig. 4.3.

LET'S EXPLORE > Such calculations are simple, but there is a catch. In the Gregorian calendar, there is no year zero . The year 1 CE follows immediately the year 1 BCE. Draw a simple timeline marking every year from 2 BCE to 2 CE; you will see that because of the absence of a year zero, only 3 years have passed between those two dates. > So to calculate the number of years between a BCE date and a CE date, you should add them but subtract 1 in the above case,2+2-1=3. > Practice afew examples with your classmates. For example, to return to the question about the Buddha, suppose we are now in the year 2024 CE, then the Buddha was born 560 + 2024 1 = 2,583 years ago. End of last Birth of the ice
