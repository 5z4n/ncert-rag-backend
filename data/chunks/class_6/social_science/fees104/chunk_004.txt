But keep in mind that in the case of history, quite a few pieces of the puzzle may remain missing! Observe the figure at the bottom of the page. It brings together the main sources of history.

When historians study, say, a king or queen of 1,500 years ago, an ancient monument, a war or some items of trade, they take great care to gather information from as many sources as they can find and consult. Sometimes, the sources confirm each other (the jigsaw pieces match); at other times, sources may give contradictory information (the jigsaw pieces don t match), in which case they need to decide which source they can trust more. That is how they try to re-create the history of the period they are studying. Who contributes to all these sources of history? Historians themselves, but also archaeologists, epigraphists (who study ancient inscriptions), anthropologists (who study human societies and their cultures), experts in literature and languages, and some more. In addition, in the last 50 years or so, scientific studies have been contributing more and more to the reconstruction of the past. For example, studies of ancient climates, chemical studies of excavated materials and studies of the genetics of ancient people have provided fresh insights, which supplement the more usual sources. And when historians study recent history (which usually means the last two or three centuries), another source is newspapers; for the last few decades, electronic media (television, the internet, etc.) can also be consulted.

This appears to be a very long time, yet it is only a tiny fraction of the Earth s history. Let us have a quick look at our early history.
