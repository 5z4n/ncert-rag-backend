years have passed between those two dates. > So to calculate the number of years between a BCE date and a CE date, you should add them but subtract 1 in the above case,2+2-1=3. > Practice afew examples with your classmates. For example, to return to the question about the Buddha, suppose we are now in the year 2024 CE, then the Buddha was born 560 + 2024 1 = 2,583 years ago.

It runs from the beginning of humanity to the present, with a few important landmarks. Note that the dotted portion marks a skipped period; otherwise, this timeline would have to be almost 3 metres long! Birth of the Buddha id 560 JESUS 2000 Past BCE BIRTH CE Future A timeline also helps in understanding the order in which historical events take place. For example, even without looking at dates, you can now see that the birth of Buddha occurs before that of Jesus. DON'T MISS OUT Along with a year and a decade (a period of ten years), we often use other terms to understand longer durations of time. Two of these are quite commonly used when learning about history. 1. Century: It is any period of 100 years. In history, specific centuries are counted every 100 years starting from the year 1 CE. For instance, we are currently in the 21st century CE, which runs from 2001 to 2100. Reprint 2025-26 03-02-2025 04:57:17 | The centuries BCE are calculated beginning from the year 1 BCE and keep going back in time. For example, the 3 century BCE would include the years 300 BCE to 201 BCE. 2. Millennium: It is any period of 1,000 years. In history, specific centuries are counted every 1,000 years from the year 1 CE. For instance, we are currently in the 3 millennium CE, which began in 2001 CE and will go up to 3000 CE. As with centuries, millenniums BCE are also calculated beginning from 1 BCE and go backwards. So the 1* millennium BCE would include the years 1 BCE to 1000 BCE. In the timeline given on pages 62 and 63 (Fig. 4.3), can you mark the beginning of the 8" millennium BCE? (Note: In English, the plural of millennium is millenniums or millennia ; both are correct.)
