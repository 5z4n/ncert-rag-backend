The Mahabharata is one of India s most famous texts (we read about it in the theme Our Cultural Heritage and Knowledge Traditions ). Interestingly, it lists many regions, such as Kashmira (more or less today s Kashmir), Kurukshetra (parts of Haryana today), Vanga (parts of Bengal), Pragjyotisha (roughly today s Assam), Kaccha (today s Kutch), Kerala (more or less today s Kerala), and so on. LET'S EXPLORE Do you recognise the names of any regions given in the map (Fig. 5.4) on page 79? List the ones that you have heard of. But when do we come across a name for the entire Indian Subcontinent? Because ancient Indian texts are difficult to date, this is not an easy question to answer. The Mahabharata uses the terms Bharatavarsha and Jambudvipa , and scholars generally agree that this long poem was written from a few centuries BCE onward. The first term, Bharatavarsha , clearly extends to the entire Subcontinent, and the text includes the names of numerous rivers and peoples. Bharatavarsha means the country of the Bharatas . Bharata is a name that first appears in the Rig Veda, where it refers to one of the main Vedic groups of people. In later literature, several kings named Bharata are mentioned. The second term, Jambudvipa , means the island of the fruit of the jamun tree . This is indeed a common tree native to India, also called jambul tree , Malabar plum tree , etc. Jambudvipa came to mean the Indian Subcontinent. In fact, we get a good clue from an Indian emperor his name is Ashoka and we will meet him later; for now, we can take his date to be about 250 BCE. As we will see, he left us many inscriptions. In one of them, he used the same Reprint 2025-26 03-02-2025 04:57:09 | 35 N 30 N 25 N 20 N 15 N 10 N 5 N | chapter5.indd 79 a on Ma km 750 1,000 1,250 65 E 70 E 7S E 80 E 85 E 90 E 95 E Fig. 5.4.
