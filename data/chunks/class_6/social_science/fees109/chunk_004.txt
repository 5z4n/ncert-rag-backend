Some had dropped out of school, while others had never been to school. Kamal started giving them tuition from 5:30 to 9:30 pm every day, after his regular work hours. He also provided the kids with a free dinner. Soon, 150 children were attending those classes regularly and were deeply interested in the lessons! A few teachers from a local school noticed the classes and joined the teaching for a while. One of them observed, These children don t get proper benches to sit on, have no silence zone classrooms and the vehicles passing by make lots of noise, yet they pay all their attention to what the teachers tell them. This touched my heart. The love and affection I got from them was unbelievable. Some older children who were attending regular schools also joined as volunteers to teach in Kamal s classes. One of them remarked, We went there to teach, instead we learnt a lot from them. , Discuss this story in your class.

New types of communities have also emerged in the last 30 or 40 years. Residents Welfare Associations in many urban areas are examples of communities that make their own rules and regulations. Those could be rules about waste management, cleanliness of common areas, taking care of pets, and so on. People living in the community participate in making such rules and regulations. Communities are ultimately interdependent. The same Residents Welfare Associations, for instance, will depend onthe trading community for supplies and also on municipal workers to handle waste. In our complex societies, everyone depends on a number of other people and communities.
