lower town , where common people lived. Some large buildings seem to have been used for collective purposes for instance, warehouses where goods to be transported were stored. Individual houses of various sizes lined the streets and smaller lanes. Interestingly, the quality of construction was the same for small and big houses. All those buildings were generally made of bricks. The purpose of some of the structures remains a matter of debate. This is the case of the famous Great Bath in Mohenjo-daro (Fig. 6.6 on page 93), a small but elaborate tank which measured about 12 x 7 metres and had waterproofing materials (such as natural bitumen, a form of tar) applied on top of carefully laid-out bricks. The tank Reprint 2025-26 chapter6_310125.indd 91 & Fortification: A massive wall surrounding a settlement or city, generally for protective purposes. Elite: Here, the word refers to the higher layers of the society, such as rulers, officials, administrators, and often priests. 6 The Beginnings of Indian Civilisation 03-02-2025 05:04:49 | Exploring Society: India and Beyond Tapestry of the Past | chapter6_310125.indd 92 (Top) Fig. 6.4.

Fig. 6.6. Mohenjo-daro s Great Bath What was the purpose of such a structure? Archaeologists have proposed several possible interpretations a public bath for people; a bath for the royal family only; or a tank used for religious rituals. The first interpretation is now ruled out because it turns out that in this city, most houses had individual bathrooms. LET S EXPLORE Have a debate in class about the last two interpretations. Can you think of any others? Remember that in this case, we do not have any other source of history no inscription, no text, no traveller s account. 6 The Beginnings of Indian Civilisation Reprint 2025-26 | chapter6_310125.indd 93 & 03-02-2025 05:04:50 | Water Management The Harappans gave much importance to water management and cleanliness. They often had separate areas for bathing in their homes; these were connected to a larger network of drains (Fig. 6.7), which generally ran below the streets and took the waste water away. Fig. 6.7. Drainage system at Lothal (Gujarat) Exploring Society: India and Beyond Tapestry of the Past In Mohenjo-daro, people drew water from hundreds of wells made of bricks. But in other regions, it may have been Reprint 2025-26 | chapter6_310125.indd 94 & 03-02-2025 05:04:51 | from ponds, nearby streams or human-made reservoirs. In the case of Dholavira (in the Rann of Kutch in Gujarat), the largest reservoir measured 73 metres
