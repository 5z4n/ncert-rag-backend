(modern Irag and Syria), that happened about 6,000 years ago, and the civilisation in ancient Egypt followed a few centuries later. You will learn about these and a few more civilisations in a later grade. Inmany ways, humanity would nothave reached its present stage without the enormous contributions and advances of those ancient civilisations. For now, however, we will only look at the Indian Subcontinent, and its northwest region is where our story begins. Beginning of +...

From Village to City The vast plains of the Punjab (today divided between India and Pakistan) and Sindh (now in Pakistan) are watered by the Indus River and its tributaries. This made those plains fertile and, therefore, favourable to agriculture. A little further east, a few millenniums ago, another river, the Sarasvati, used to flow from the foothills of the Himalayas through Haryana, Punjab, parts of Rajasthan and Gujarat (see Fig. 6.3). In this whole region, from about 3500 BCE, villages grew into towns, and with increasing trade and other exchanges, those towns further grew into cities. This transition happened around 2600 BCE. Archaeologists gave this civilisation several names Indus , Harappan , Indus-Sarasvat? or Sindhu-Sarasvat? civilisation. We will use all these terms. Its inhabitants are called Harappans . It is one of the oldest civilisations in the world. DON T MISS OUT Why are the inhabitants of this civilisation called Harappans today? That is simply because the city of Harappa (today in Pakistan s Punjab) was the first of this civilisation to be excavated, way back in 1920-21, over a century ago. This development is also called the First Urbanisation of India . Reprint 2025-26 03-02-2025 05:04:48 | 72E 75 E 78 E Fig. 6.3.
