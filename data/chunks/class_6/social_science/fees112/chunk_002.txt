Services under the Indore Municipal Corporation Reprint 2025-26 & 03-02-2025 05:03:14 | Y THINK ABOUT IT chapter12.indd 179 Indore in Madhya Pradesh has been awarded the cleanest city in India under the Swachh Survekshan government scheme for seven years in a row. What could have been the role of Indore citizens in this achievement? As we see, Chennai and Indore have a Municipal Corporation at the top of their urban bodies. Only cities with a population above 10 lakhs have a Municipal Corporation (also called Mahanagar Nigam ) as their highest body. Between 1 and 10 lakhs, the highest body is a Municipal Council (also called Nagar Palika ). Cities and towns with smaller populations have a Nagar Panchayat. LET'S EXPLORE > Select a few cities, from your State and from a few neighbouring States. These may include the city you live in or the city nearest to your town or village. How will you find out if they have a Nagar Panchayat, Municipal Council or Municipal Corporation? Draw a table with the names of the cities and the type of urban local body each of them has. > How do urban local bodies fund their activities? (Hint: Look carefully at the pictures of the functions performed by Indore Municipal Corporation in Figure 12.4 on page 178.) Are some of them paid services? Sameer: Hello!

There are so many people rushing around all the time, and it s noisy compared to the quietness here. Also, people are more independent and often don't even know their neighbours. Sameer: Wow! Here, everyone knows everyone else and pitches in to help each other out we work together in the fields, celebrate festivals together, and even make decisions as a community. Anita: Well, there s still some sense of community in the city. Just the other day, following heavy rains, a house collapsed two streets away. Dozens of people gathered from all over the place to help clear the rubble and make sure no one was trapped inside. Sameer: Doesn't the local government help in such cases? Anita: Yes, it does. In
