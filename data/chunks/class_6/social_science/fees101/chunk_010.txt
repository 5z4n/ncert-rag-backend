1.5. The Ujjayini prime meridian used in ancient Indian astronomy. Cities marked with a circle are mentioned in astronomical texts as being on this meridian (the modern name is given after the oblique bar). Reprint 2025-26 03-02-2025 04:58:07 | Fig. 1.6. This map, published by the Survey of India, shows the country s outline along with a few parallels of latitude and meridians of longitude. India s latitudes extend approximately from to 8 N to 37 N, and longitudes approximately from 68 E to 97 E. (The two colours have been added.)

A full turn is 360 , so this means 15 per hour (15 x 24 = 360). Let us now mark the meridians of longitude every 15 . Moving eastward from the Prime Meridian, we get 0 , 15 E, 30 E, 45 E, and so on every 15 up to 180 E. It is the same as adding one hour of local time with each meridian if it is 12 pm or noon at Greenwich, it is 1 pm local time at 15 E, 2 pm at 30 E, and so on. But going westward, it is the other way round 11 am local time at 15 W, 10 am at 30 W, etc. 45 W 30 W 15 W 0 15 E 30 E 45 E Fig. 1.7. This graph shows longitudes at the bottom and the local time at the top, with reference to the Prime Meridian at 0 . Each colour is a zone of 15 centred on a meridian. Reprint 2025-26 03-02-2025 04:58:07 | LET'S EXPLORE Two friends, one sitting in Porbandar (Gujarat) and the other in Tinsukia (Assam), are speaking on the phone late afternoon. The latter remarks that the sun has set in Assam and it s now dark. The former is surprised and says, But it s still full daylight here! Explain why. And, as a class activity, calculate the difference in local time between those two cities. (Hint: for now, consider the difference in longitude between Porbandar and Tinsukia to be 30 ; later, you can find out the precise value.) The same method can be used to calculate the local time of any place on the Earth. But it would not be convenient for a country to use many local times! That is why most countries adopt a standard time based on a meridian passing through them. Indian Standard Time (IST) is 5 hours 30 minutes (also noted 5.5 hours) ahead of the local time at Greenwich (called Greenwich Mean Time or GMT).
