with the letter W or E added. For instance, using round figures, New York s longitude is 74 W, while Delhi s is 77 E and Tokyo s is 140 E. DON'T MISS OUT As you can see on the globe of meridians of longitudes, 180 W and 180 E are the same longitude; so this longitude is noted 180 , omitting the letter W or E. Latitude and longitude together are the two coordinates of a place. With them, you are now able to locate any place on Earth! You can now understand a statement such as Delhi lies at 29 N latitude and 77 E longitude (these values are rounded off, not exact). Fig. 1.3 on page 15 shows the parallels of latitude and the meridians of longitude together on the globe as blue lines.

LET'S EXPLORE If the globe or atlas in your class has well-marked latitudes and longitudes, try to note down approximate values for the latitude and longitude of (1) Mumbai, (2) Kolkata, (3) Singapore, (4) Paris. Greenwich Meridian Western Hemisphere Northern Hemisphere Eastern Hemisphere Southern Hemisphere Fig. 1.4. This sketch shows how the Prime Meridian divides the Earth into the Western and Eastern Hemispheres, while the Equator divides it into the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. 5 DON'T MISS OUT The Greenwich Meridian is not the first prime meridian. There were others in the past. In fact, many centuries before Europe, India had a prime meridian of its own! (Fig. 1.5) It was called madhya rekha (or middle line ) and passed through the city of Ujjayini (today Ujjain), which was a reputed centre for astronomy over many centuries. Varahamihira, a famous astronomer, lived and worked there some 1,500 years ago. Indian astronomers were aware of concepts of latitude and longitude, including the need for a zero or prime meridian. The Ujjayini meridian became a reference for calculations in all Indian astronomical texts. 1 - Locating Places on the Earth Reprint 2025-26 chapter1_310125.indd 17 & 03-02-2025 045807 | India and the World: Land and the People Exploring Society: India and Beyond | chapter1_310125.indd 18 The map shows a few ancient Indian cities close to the Ujjayini meridian. Some are very close to it, while others are a little away. That is because measuring longitude required accurate timekeeping, which was not as precise then as it is today. Ancient city @ Modern city g Fig. 1.5. The Ujjayini prime meridian used in ancient Indian astronomy. Cities marked with a circle are mentioned in astronomical texts as being on this meridian (the modern name is given after the oblique bar). Reprint 2025-26 03-02-2025 04:58:07 | Fig. 1.6. This map, published by the Survey of India, shows the country s outline along with a few parallels of latitude and meridians of longitude. India s latitudes extend approximately from to 8 N to 37 N, and longitudes approximately
