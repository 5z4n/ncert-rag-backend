hot (it is also called torrid ). As you travel away from the Equator towards one of the two poles (in other words, as your latitude increases), the climate becomes more moderate (or temperate ). And closer to the North or South Pole, the climate grows colder (or frigid ). You will learn in Science why this is so, and Reprint 2025-26 03-02-2025 04:58:06 | also why we experience different seasons in the course of a year. Fig. 1.3. This globe shows both parallels of latitude and meridians of longitudes c) Longitudes Imagine now that you travel from the North Pole to the South Pole by the shortest possible line. Observe the globe: you will see that instead of passing through Europe and Africa, you could just as well pass through Asia the distance would be the same. These lines are called meridians of longitude (Fig. 1.3). They are all half-circles running from one pole to the other. You will also learn in Science that the Earth spins on its axis. To put it simply, let s place a desk lamp a little away from our globe, focused on it, and imagine that this is 1 - Locating Places on the Earth Reprint 2025-26 chapter1_310125.indd 15 & 03-02-2025 04:58:06 | re el India and the World: Land and the People Exploring Society: India and Beyond chapter1_310125.indd 16 the Sun illuminating the Earth. Slowly rotating the globe eastward, we can note that for some places on the Earth it is morning, while for others it is mid-day, evening or night when it s breakfast time in one country, it s lunchtime in another and in a third country people are fast asleep! That is why by measuring the longitude of a place, we will also be measuring the time at that place. Let us see how. To measure longitudes, we need to define a reference point called the Prime Meridian (Fig. 1.3 on page 15). It is also called Greenwich Meridian because, in the year 1884, some nations decided that the meridian passing through Greenwich, an area of London in England, would become the international standard for the Prime Meridian. It is marked as 0 longitude. Just as latitude is a measure of the distance from the Equator if you travel towards one of the poles, longitude is a measure of the distance from the Prime Meridian if you travel along the Equator. Longitude, too, is measured in degrees. Westward or eastward, it increases in value from 0 to 180 , with the letter W or E added. For instance, using round figures, New York s longitude is 74 W, while Delhi s is 77 E and Tokyo s is 140 E. DON'T MISS OUT As you can see on the globe of meridians of longitudes, 180 W and 180 E are the same longitude; so this longitude is noted 180 , omitting the letter W or E. Latitude and longitude together are the two coordinates of a place. With them,
