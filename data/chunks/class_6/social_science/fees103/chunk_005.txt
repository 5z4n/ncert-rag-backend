which makes them less fertile than plains (see next section) and therefore less favourable to farming. An exception is that of lava plateaus (that is, formed through volcanic activity), as they often have a rich black soil. Plateaus are also home to many spectacular waterfalls. The Victoria Falls on the Zambezi River in southern Africa, the Hundru Falls on the Subarnarekha River in the Chhota Nagpur Plateau and the Jog Falls on the Sharavati River in the Western Ghats are a few such waterfalls. The Nohkalikai Falls (Fig. 3.7) drop down 340 metres from the Cherrapunji Plateau (in Meghalaya). 3.7.

They do not have any large hills or deep the oceans, valleys. They are generally not more than 300 metres above also called sea level. level . Floodplains are one type of plains formed by rivers originating in mountain ranges, where they collect particles of rock, sand and silt called sediments . These sediments are carried all the way to the plains, where the rivers deposit them, making the soil very fertile. As a result, these plains are ideal for growing crops of all kinds, and agriculture is a major economic occupation in this landform. Plains also support a variety of flora and fauna. | Alaska Himalaya Q Yangtze q QO | Ly iS Y African Ganga & Brahmaputra a o OP Patagonian 2 Plateau Ml River Plain Mountain Range || & Fig. 3.8.

Life in the plains Thousands of years ago, the first civilisations developed around rivers in fertile plains. In our times too, a large part of the world s population lives in plains. About 40 crore people, more than one-fourth of the total Indian population, live in India s Ganga plain (often called the Gangetic plain ). As with many other plains of the Reprint 2025-26 03-02-2025 04:57:50 | world, the major occupations of people in this region include river fishing and agriculture.
