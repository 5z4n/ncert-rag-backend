of fractions, was first explicitly described in general by Brahmagupta in the year 628 CE! We will describe the history of the development of fractions in more detail later in the chapter. For now, we simply summarise the steps in Brahmagupta s method for addition of fractions. Brahmagupta s method for adding fractions 1. Find equivalent fractions so that the fractional unit is common for all fractions. This can be done by finding a common multiple of the denominators (e.g., the product of the denominators, or the smallest common multiple of the denominators). 2. Add these equivalent fractions with the same fractional units. This can be done by adding the numerators and keeping the same denominator. 3. Express the result in lowest terms if needed. Let us carry out another example of Brahmagupta s method. Example: Find the sum of and $. The denominators of the given fractions are 3 and 5. The lowest common multiple of 3 and 5 is 15. Then we see that 2x5 _10 1_1%x3 3 3x5 ~ 15 5 5x3 15 3 Reprint 2025-26 13-08-2024 15:39:47 Fractions Therefore, 3 + : = ie + a = iz. Example: Find the sum of { and 3.

This can be done by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 3 (the biggest common factor of 3 and 6): 3 _ 373 _1 6 673 2 1 1 _1 Therefore, gst 3-5 % Figure it Out 1.

Let us start with the problem of subtracting 4 from 8, i.e., what is 6 _ 49 5 : To solve this problem, we can again use the rectangular strips. In both fractions, the fractional unit is the same, i.e., i. Let us first represent the bigger fraction using a rectangular strip model as shown: NO = Each shaded part represents 5. Now, we need to subtract . To do this let us
