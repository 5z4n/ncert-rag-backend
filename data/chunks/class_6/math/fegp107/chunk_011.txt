Reprint 2025-26 (7) Chapter 7_Fractions.indd 175 13-08-2024 15:39:47 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 Adding fractions with the same fractional unit or denominator Example: Find the sum of 2 and 3. Let us represent both using the rectangular strips. In both fractions, the fractional unit is the same 5? so, each strip will be divided into 5 equal parts. So 2 will be represented as And + will be represented as Adding the two given fractions is the same as finding out the total number of shaded parts, each of which represent the same fractional unit E In this case, the total number of shaded parts is 3. Since, each shaded part represents the fractional unit 1, we see that the 3 shaded parts together represent the fraction 3. 2,1. 39 | Therefore, 5+ 5 = 3% | Example: Find the sum of 7 and . Let us represent both again using the rectangular strip model. Here in both fractions, the fractional unit is the same, i.e., - so each strip will be divided into 7 equal parts. Then 4 will be represented as Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 7_Fractions.indd 176 13-08-2024 15:39:47 Fractions and will be represented as In this case, the total number of Y While adding fractions with the same fractional unit, just add the number of shaded parts is 10, and each shaded part represents the fractional unit 5; so, the 10 shaded parts together represent the fraction v as seen here. fractional units from each fraction. 7 _ 3 =1+5 Therefore, | + _43 =15. F Try adding 4+ using a number line. Do you get the same answer? Adding fractions with different fractional units or denominators Example: Find the sum of } and 3. To add fractions with different fractional units, first convert the fractions into equivalent fractions with the same denominator or Reprint 2025-26 G7) Chapter 7_Fractions.indd 177 13-08-2024 15:39:47 Chapter 7_Fractions.indd 178 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 fractional unit. In this case, the common denominator can be made 3 x 4= 12, i.e., we can find equivalent fractions with fractional unit or Let us write the equivalent fraction for each given fraction. 1x3 _3 1 1x4 4 4x3 ~ 12 3 ~ 3x47 12 4 Now, oO and a have the same fractional unit, i.e., or 1 1 _ 3 4 _ 7 Therefore, 4+ 3 7DpDtprD This method of addition, which works for adding any number of fractions, was first explicitly described in general by Brahmagupta in the year 628 CE! We will describe the history of the development of fractions in more detail later in the chapter. For now, we simply summarise the steps in Brahmagupta s method for addition of fractions. Brahmagupta s method for adding fractions 1. Find equivalent fractions so that the fractional unit is common for all fractions. This can be done by finding a common multiple of the denominators (e.g.,
