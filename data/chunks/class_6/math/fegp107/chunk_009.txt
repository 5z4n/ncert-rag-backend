terms (or in its simplest form) In any fraction, if its numerator and denominator have no common factor except 1, then the fraction is said to be in lowest terms or in its simplest form. In other words, a fraction is said to be in lowest terms if its numerator and denominator are as small as possible. Any fraction can be expressed in lowest terms by finding an equivalent fraction whose numerator and denominator are as small as possible. Let s see how to express fractions in lowest terms. Example: Is the fraction is in lowest terms? No, 4is acommon factor of 16 and 20. Let us reduce os to lowest terms. We know that both 16 (numerator) and 20 (denominator) are divisible by 4. So, 16:4 _4 2074 ~5 Now, there is no common factor between 4 and 5. Hence expressed in lowest terms is e: SO, . is called the simplest form of since 4 and 5 have no common factor other than 1. > 20 20 Any fraction can be converted to lowest terms by dividing both the numerator and denominator by the highest common factor between them.

Suppose we want to express = in lowest terms. First, we notice that both the numerator and denominator are even. So, we divide 36 _ 18 both by 2, and see that <4 = 35. Both the numerator and denominator are even again, SO we can divide them each by 2 again; we get 3 = 3. We now notice that 9 and 15 are both multiples of 3, so we divide both by 3 to get 3 = 3. Now, 3 and 5 have no common factor other than 1, so, 26 in lowest > 60 terms is 3. Alternatively, we could have noticed thatin ae , both the numerator and denominator are multiples of 12 : we see that 36 = 3 x 12 and 60 = 5 x 12. Therefore, we could have concluded that 36 = 3 straight away. Either method works and will give the same answer! But sometimes it can be easier to go in steps. %& Figure it Out Express the following fractions in lowest terms: 17 64 e 126 d 525 a. oT - 44 : 47 - 772 7.7 Comparing Fractions Which is greater, 2 or 7? It can be difficult to compare two such fractions directly. However, we know howto find fractions equivalent to two fractions with the same denominator. Let us see how we can use it: 4 4X9 _ 36 5 ~ 8x9 ~ 45 45 is acommon multiple of 5 and 9, so we can 7 _ 7X5 _ 35 9 ~ 9x5 ~ 45 use 45 as acommon denominator.
