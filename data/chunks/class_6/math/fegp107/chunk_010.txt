Which is greater, 2 or 7? It can be difficult to compare two such fractions directly. However, we know howto find fractions equivalent to two fractions with the same denominator. Let us see how we can use it: 4 4X9 _ 36 5 ~ 8x9 ~ 45 45 is acommon multiple of 5 and 9, so we can 7 _ 7X5 _ 35 9 ~ 9x5 ~ 45 use 45 as acommon denominator.

Let us try this for another pair: 7 and 7. 63 isa common multiple of 9 and 21. We can then write: 7_7*X7_ 49 17 _17x3 _ 51 9 ~ 9X7 ~ 63 21 21x3~ 63 49 _ 51 7. 17\ Clearly, 63 < 63 So, 9 < 57! Let s Summarise! Steps to compare the sizes of two or more given fractions: Step 1: Change the given fractions to equivalent fractions so that they all are expressed with the same denominator or same fractional unit. Step 2: Now, compare the equivalent fractions by simply comparing the numerators, i.e., the number of fractional units each has. % Figure it Out 1.

Meena ate , of it and her younger brother ate 5 of it. How much of the total chikki did Meena and her brother eat together? We can arrive at the answer by visualising it. Let us take a piece of chikki and divide it into two halves first like this. Meena ate , of it as shown in the picture. 1 Meena ate Let us now divide the remaining half into two further halves as shown. Each of these pieces is } of the whole chikki. Meena s brother ate 5 of the whole chikki, as is shown in the picture. Brother ate The total chikki eaten is } (by Meena) and ; (by her brother) The total chikki eaten _1,1 3774 NS Total chikki eaten ~i1,1,1 -qatqatg = 1_3 3x q=G How much of the total chikki is remaining?

Let us represent both using the rectangular strips. In both fractions, the fractional unit is the same 5? so, each strip will be divided into 5 equal parts. So 2 will be
