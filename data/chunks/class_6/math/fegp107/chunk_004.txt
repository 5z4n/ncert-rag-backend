Did you notice that the lengths of all the blue lines were less than one and the lengths of all the black lines were more than 1? Write down all the fractions you marked on the number line earlier. Now, let us classify these in two groups: Lengths less than 1 unit Lengths more than 1 unit %& Did you notice something common between the fractions that are greater than 1? In all the fractions that are less than 1 unit, the numerator is smaller than the denominator, while in the fractions that are more than 1 unit, the numerator is larger than the denominator. We know that 3, 3 and / are all greater than 1 unit. But can we see how many whole units they contain? 3_1,1,1- 1 p=gtgt galt, 5_1,1,1,1,1- 1 p= gt gt gtgtg=4ta 1,1,1_3_ 1 I know that 3 ++ g=3> 1. If 1 add one more 3 I will get more than 1 unit! So 44. *3 Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 7_Fractions.indd 161 13-08-2024 15:39:40 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 % Figure it Out 1. How many whole units are there in 7? mC) Math Talk | | 2. How many whole units are there in 3 and in i? Writing fractions greater than one as mixed numbers We saw that: $ = 1+ 3. We can write other fractions in a similar way. For example, 4_1,1,1,1_4,1 g=gtgtgt gaits. J 1 _ 3x 3-1 %f Figure it Out 1. Figure out the number of whole units in each of the following fractions: 8 11 9 a. 3 b. 5 C.F We saw that 8_942 This number is thus also called two and 3 3 two thirds . We also write it as 2 ; . Fraction Mixed number 2. Can all fractions greater than 1 be written as such mixed numbers? A mixed number or mixed fraction contains a whole number (called the whole part) and a fraction that is less than 1 (called the fractional part). a. 5 b. ul QD |S p |S fe) IS our) IS Can we write a mixed number (mixed fraction) as a regular fraction? Yes! I figured out a way to write a mixed number asa regular fraction! Jaya: When I have 3+ , this means 1+1+1+ 2.1 know ee) 4?
