sugarcane juice divided equally among 10 children. 2. Group 1: 4 glasses of sugarcane juice divided equally among 7 children. Group 2: 5 glasses of sugarcane juice divided equally among 7 children. Which groups were easier to compare? Why? When the number of children is same, it is easier Shabnam: To compare the first two groups, we have to find fractions equivalent to the fractions 3 7 + and i. ; . 6 _ 3 21_ 79 Mukta: How about 3 = | and 30 = 10! to compare, isn t it?

The fractional unit used for the two fractions have to be the same! Like 2 and 2 both use the same fractional unit (i.e., the denominators are the same). But and 4+ do not use the same fractional units (they have different denominators). Mukta: Okay, so let us start making equivalent fractions then: 3 _6_9 _ 12 _ 15 ? t= 38 = q = T6 = 39 But when do I stop* Shabnam: Got it! How about we go on till 4 x 10 = 40. Mukta: You mean the product of the two denominators? Sounds good! We have 3 z and 5 The product of the two denominators (4 and 10)3 is 40. 3_6_9 _12 15 _ 18 _ 27 _ 30 4~8~ 127 16~ 20~ 24~ ~ 36 ~ 40 Go till we reach the 7 ~14_ 21 _ 28 denominator 40. 10 20 ~ 30 40 : 15 14 But notice that 50 and 70 also had Yes! We just needed to get the same fractional units for each the same denominator! fraction.

In other words, a fraction is said to be in lowest terms if its numerator and denominator are as small as possible. Any fraction can be expressed in lowest terms by finding an equivalent fraction whose numerator and denominator are as small as possible. Let
