s method also applies when subtracting fractions! Let us start with the problem of subtracting 4 from 8, i.e., what is 6 _ 49 5 : To solve this problem, we can again use the rectangular strips. In both fractions, the fractional unit is the same, i.e., i. Let us first represent the bigger fraction using a rectangular strip model as shown: NO = Each shaded part represents 5. Now, we need to subtract . To do this let us remove 4 of the shaded parts: Fractional parts to be removed. We can do this here directly because both fractions have the same fractional units. So, we are left with 2 shaded parts, i.e., Try doing this same exercise using the number line.

As we already know the procedure for subtraction of fractions with the same fractional units, let us convert each of the given fractions into equivalent fractions with the same fractional units. Yes! By doing this we can easily subtract the two fractions. 3 _ (8x3) _ 9 4 ~ (4x3) ~ 12 Think! Why did we choose to multiply both the numerator and denominator by 3? and similarly, 2 _ (2x4) _ 8 oO 3 ~ (3x4) ~ 12 O Again! Why did we choose to multiply both the numerator and denominator here by 4? Therefore, 3 - 4 - 3 _@%1., Brahmagupta s method for subtracting two fractions 1. Convert the given fractions into equivalent fractions with the same fractional unit, i.e., the same denominator. 2. Carry out the subtraction of fractions having the same fractional units. This can be done by subtracting the numerators and keeping the same denominator. 3. Simplify the result into lowest terms if needed.

It was also called bhaga or ansha
