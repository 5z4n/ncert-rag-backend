Mukta: So, we must compare } and 3. Which is more? Shabnam: Well, we have seen that } = ; and clearly a < 2. So, the children for whom 5 chikkis is divided equally among 8 will get more than those children for whom 1 chikki is divided equally among 2. The children of the second group will get more chikki each. %e& What about the following groups? In which group will each child get more? 1 chikki divided between 2 children or 4 chikkis divided among 7 children. Shabnam: The children of which group will get more chikki this time? Mukta: We must compare 4 and Now 1x4 _ 4 1_4 2x4 8 sO, 2 8 Shabnam: But why did you multiply the numerator and denominator by 4 again? Mukta: You will see! When 4 chikkis are divided equally among 7 children, each one will get > chikki. When 4 chikkis are divided equally among 8 children, each one will get chikki. So 2 > 3.

Group 1: 4 glasses of sugarcane juice divided equally among 7 children. Group 2: 5 glasses of sugarcane juice divided equally among 7 children. Which groups were easier to compare? Why? When the number of children is same, it is easier Shabnam: To compare the first two groups, we have to find fractions equivalent to the fractions 3 7 + and i. ; . 6 _ 3 21_ 79 Mukta: How about
