Let us do some more activities with the same paper strips. Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 What do you observe? cr < XR * Are the lengths + and 4 equal? - Are the lengths and } equal? 1_2_4 We can say that = D8: These are equivalent fractions that denote the same length, but they are expressed in terms of different fractional units. Now, check whether } and 2 are equivalent fractions or not, using paper strips. Make your own fraction wall using such strips as given in the picture below! %e& Answer the following questions after looking at the fraction wall: 1. Are the lengths + and 2 equal? 2. Are Zand {equivalent | TUNE fractions? Why? re rs length of 3? eee 4. How many pieces of length , will make a length of 3? Fractions We can extend this idea to make a fraction wall up to the fractional unit +. (This fraction wall is given at the end of the book.) %& Figure it Out 8 1. Are 2, $, 3, equivalent fractions? Why? 2. Write two equivalent fractions for . |= -| = -| Np, Were (Write as many as you can) Understanding equivalent fractions using equal shares 3. ons One roti was shared equally by four children. f. ' What fraction of the whole did each child get? Sj The adjoining picture shows the division ofa roti among four children. Fraction of roti each child got is -. h A K K The four shares must be equal to each other! Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 You can also express this event through division facts, addition facts, and multiplication facts. The division fact is 1 + 4 = i: e,e . _ 1 1 1 The addition fact is 1 = atatatyT 4 The multiplication fact is 1 = 4 x . %f Figure it Out 1. Three rotis are shared equally by four children. Show the division in the picture and write a fraction for how much each child gets.
