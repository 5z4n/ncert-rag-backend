are reduced to a common denominator. Then, in case of addition, the numerators (obtained after the above reduction) are added. In case of subtraction, their difference is taken. (Brahmagupta, Brahmasphutasiddhanta, Verse 12.2, 628 CE) The Indian concepts and methods involving fractions were transmitted to Europe via the Arabs over the next few centuries and they came into general use in Europe in around the 17th century and then spread worldwide.

It is easy to add up fractional units to obtain the sum 1, if one uses the same fractional unit, for example, 3 1,1_4 1 1_4 1,1,1 ptgehbgt+gtgeh gtgt 1 at+ata 1, etc. However, can you think of a way to add fractional units that are all different to get 1? It is not possible to add two different fractional units to get 1. The reason is that 5 is the largest fractional unit, and 5 + 5 =1. To get different fractional units, we would have to replace at least one of the 58 with some smaller fractional unit - but then the sum would be less than 1! Therefore, it is not possible for two different fractional units to add up to 1. We can try to look instead for a way to write 1 as the sum of three different fractional units. , 1. Can you find three different fractional units that add This up to 1? It turns out there is only one solution to this problem (up to changing the order of the 3 fractions)! Can you find it? Try to find it before reading further. Here is a systematic way to find the solution. We know that ;+4+4=1.To get the fractional units to be different, we will have to increase at least one of the #8; and decrease at least one of the other zs to compensate for that increase. The only way to increase ; to another fractional unit is to replace it by 5. So 5 must be one of the fractional units. Now 5 + 4 + 4 = 1. To get the fractional units to be different, we will have to increase one of the rs and decrease the other 5 to compensate for that increase. Now the only way to increase to Reprint 2025-26 14-08-2024 15:06:07 Fractions another fractional unit, that is different from $, is to replace it by 3. So two of the fractions must be } and 3! What must be third fraction then, so that the three fractions add up to 1? This explains why there is only one solution to the above problem. What if we look for four different fractional units that add up to 1? 2. Can you find four different fractional units that add_ ,; up to 1? p It turns out that this problem has six solutions! Can you find at least one of them? Can you find them all? You can try
