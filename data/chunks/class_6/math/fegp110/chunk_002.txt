some number of times. Zero is neither a positive nor a negative number. We do not put a + or ~ sign in front of it.

Where will you reach? We can describe this using an expression: Starting Floor + Movement = Target Floor. The starting floor is +1 (Food Court) and the number of button presses is +2. Therefore, you reach the target floor (+ 1) +(+2)=+3 (Book Store). % Figure it Out 1. You start from Floor +2 and press 3 in the lift. Where will you reach? Write an expression for this movement. 2. Evaluate these expressions (you may think of them as Starting Floor + Movement by referring to the Building of Fun). a (41)+G4)=_ b. (#4)+G 1)=_ c. (+4)+(-3)=_ d. (-1)+@2)=_ e. -1)+G1I=_ f. 0+(+2) = g. 0+(-2)= 3. Starting from different floors, find the movements required to reach Floor -5. For example, if I start at Floor +2, I must press 7 to reach Floor 5. The expression is (+ 2) + (-7) = 5. Find more such starting positions and the movements needed to reach Floor 5 and write the expressions. Combining button presses is also addition Gurmit was in the Toy Store and wanted to go down two floors. But by mistake he pressed the + button two times. He realised his mistake and quickly pressed the button three times. How many floors below or above the Toy Store will Gurmit reach? Gurmit will go one floor down. We can show the movement resulting from combining button presses as an expression: (+2)+(-3) =-1.

(+4)+(1) = c. (+4)+( 3)+(@2) = d. (-1)+(+2)+(-3) = Back to zero! On the ground floor, Basant is in a great hurry and by mistake he presses +3. What can he do to cancel it and stay on the ground floor? He can cancel it by pressing 3. That is, (+3) + 3) =0. We call -3 the inverse of +3. Similarly, the inverse of 3 is +3. If Basant now presses +4 and then presses 4 in the lift, where will he reach? Here is another way to think of the concept of inverse. If you are at Floor +4 and you press its inverse 4, then you are back to zero, the ground floor! If you are at Floor 2 and press its inverse +2, then you go to ( 2) + (+2) = 0, again the ground floor! xf Write the inverses of these numbers: +4, -4, -3, 0, +2, -1. %* Connect the inverses by drawing lines. ) QA & 9) &) Comparing numbers
