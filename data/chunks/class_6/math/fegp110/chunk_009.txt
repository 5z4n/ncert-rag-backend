being added can be replaced by its inverse and then subtracted. In this way, we can also always convert addition to subtraction. Examples: - (#7)-G@5)=( 7)+C5S) . 3)-G 8)=G3)+C8) (+8)-C2)=( 8) +2) .

To entertain himself, he keeps a box containing lots of positive (red) and negative (green) tokens. Each time he presses the + button, he takes a positive token from the box and puts it in his pocket. Similarly, each time he presses the ~ button, he takes a negative token and puts it in his pocket. He starts on the ground floor (Floor 0) with an empty pocket. After one hour, he checks his pocket and finds 5 positive and 3 negative tokens. On which floor is he now? He must have pressed + five times and ~ 3 times and (+ 5)+( 3)=+ 2. So, he is at Floor +2 now. Here is another way to do the calculation. TT ae A positive token and a negative token cancel each other, because the value of this pair of tokens together is zero. These two tokens in his pocket meant that he pressed + once and once, respectively, and these cancel each other. We say that a positive and a negative token make a zero pair . When you remove all the zero pairs, you are left with two positive tokens, so (+5) + (-3) = +2. We can perform any such addition using tokens! Example: Add+5 and -8. Shdddoce Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd 256 13-12-2024 16:07:51 The Other Side of Zero From the picture, we see that we can remove five zero pairs, and we are then left with 3. Therefore (+ 5) + (-8) =-3. %& Figure it Out 1. Complete the additions using tokens. a. (+6)+( 4) b. (-3) + (-2) c. (+5)+(-7) d. (-2) + (+6) 2. Cancel the zero pairs in the following two sets of tokens. On what floor is the lift attendant in each case? What is the corresponding addition statement in each case? OO OOOOO Using tokens for subtraction We have seen how to perform addition of integers with positive tokens and negative tokens. We can also perform subtraction using tokens! Example: Let us subtract: (5) (4). OOOO This is easy to do. From 5 positives (+5)-G4)=+1 take away 4 positives to see the result. Ces Let us subtract: Is (7) (-5) the same as ( 7) + (+5)? ( 7) (5) =-2 Example: Let us subtract: (+ 5) (+6). (+) (+) (+) (+) (+) Put down 5 positives. But there are not enough tokens to take out 6 positives! Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 To get around this issue, we can put out an extra zero pair (a positive and a negative), knowing that
