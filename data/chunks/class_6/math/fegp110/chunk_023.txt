Ans. One of the combinations is -5,7,-10. Think of other combinations. Q.3 There are two dice whose faces have these numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The smallest possible sum upon rolling these dice is 10 = ( 5) + (-5) and the largest possible sum is 12 = (6)+(6). Some numbers between ( 10) and (+12) are not possible to get by adding numbers on these two dice. Find those numbers.
