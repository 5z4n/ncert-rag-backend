What do you think will be the temperature during the summer when you feel very hot? In the winter we have cooler or colder temperatures. What has been the maximum temperature during the summer and the minimum temperature during the winter last year in your area? Find out. When we measure temperature, we use Celsius as the unit of measure ( C). The thermometers below are showing 40 C and 15 C temperatures. % Figure it Out 1. Chapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd 262 Do you know that there are some places in India where temperatures can go below 0 C? Find out the places in India where temperatures sometimes go below 0 C. What is common among these places? Why does it become colder there and not in other places? Leh in Ladakh gets very cold during the winter. The following is a table of temperature readings taken during different times of the day and night in Leh on a day in November. Match the temperature with the appropriate time of the day and night.

Bring a laboratory thermometer to the class and measure the temperature of hot water and cold water. Point out to children that there are markings in the thermometer that are below 0 C. Have a discussion on what 0 C indicates, namely, the freezing point of water. 10.4 Explorations with Integers A hollow integer grid There is something special about the numbers in these two grids. Let us explore what that is. Top row: 4+(-1)+(-3) =0 5+ (-3)+ (5) =___ Bottomrow: (-1)+(-1)+ 2 =0 (-8)+(@2)+ 7 =__ Left column: 4+(-3)+(-1) =0 5+ 0 +( 8)=___ Right column: (-3)+ 1 + 2 =0 (-5)+(-5)+ 7 = In each grid, the numbers in each of the two rows (the top row and the bottom row) and the numbers in each of the two columns (the leftmost column and the rightmost column) add up to give the same number. We shall call this sum as the border sum . The border sum of the first grid is 0 . %& Figure it Out 1. Do the calculations for the second grid above and find the border sum.
