s rules in terms of Bela s Building of Fun, or in terms of a number line? 2. Give your own examples of each rule. Brahmagupta was the first to describe zero as a number on an equal footing with positive numbers as well as with negative numbers, and the first to give explicit rules for performing arithmetic operations on allsuch numbers, positive, negative, and zero forming what is now called a ring. It would change the way the world does mathematics. However, it took many centuries for the rest of the world to adopt zero and negative numbers as numbers. These numbers were transmitted to, accepted by, and further studied by the Arab world by the 9th century, before making their way to Europe by the 13th century.

Lazare Carnot, a French mathematician in the 18th century, called negative numbers absurd . But over time, zero as well as negative numbers proved to be indispensable in global mathematics and science, and are now considered to be critical numbers on an equal footing with and as important as positive numbers just as Brahmagupta had recommended and explicitly described way back in the year 628 CE! This abstraction of arithmetic rules on all numbers paved the way for the modern development of algebra, which we will learn about in future classes. m There are numbers that are less than zero. They are written with a ~ sign in front of them (e.g., - 2), and are called negative numbers. They lie to the left of zero on the number line. m The numbers ..., 4, -3, 2,-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... are called integers. The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, ... are called positive integers and the numbers ..., 4, 3, -2,-1 are called negative integers. Zero (0) is neither positive nor negative. m Every given number has another number associated to it which when added to the given number gives zero. This is called the additive inverse of the number. For example, the additive inverse of 7 is 7 and the additive inverse of 543 is 543. m Addition can be interpreted as Starting Position + Movement = Target Position. m Addition can also be interpreted as the combination of movements or increases/decreases: Movement 1 + Movement 2 = Total Movement. m Subtraction can be interpreted as Target Position Starting Position = Movement.

If both numbers are positive, add the numbers and the result is a positive number (e.g., 2
