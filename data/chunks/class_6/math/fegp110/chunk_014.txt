You can pick any of these and make an expression using addition(s) and subtraction(s). Here is an expression: (+ 18)+(+1)- (G7)- C@2) which gives a value (+ 14). Now, pick cards and make an expression such that its value is closer to ( 30). 8. Thesum of two positive integers is always positive but a (positive integer) (positive integer) can be positive or negative. What about a. (positive) (negative) b. (positive) + (negative) c. (negative) + (negative) d. (negative) (negative) e. (negative) (positive) f. (negative) + (positive) 9. This string has a total of 100 tokens arranged in a particular pattern. What is the value of the string? GOSHSOSLSSOSOSS 10.5 A Pinch of History Like general fractions, general integers (including zero and the negative numbers) were first conceived ofand used in Asia, thousands of years ago, before they eventually spread across the world in more modern times. The first known instances of the use of negative numbers occurred in the context of accounting. In one of China s most important mathematical works, The Nine Chapters on Mathematical Art (iuzhang Suanshu) which was completed by the first or second century CE positive and negative numbers were represented using red and black rods, much like the way we represented them using green and red tokens!

The concept of credit and debit was written about extensively by Kautilya in his Arthashastra (c. 300 BCE), including the recognition that an account balance could be negative. The explicit use ofnegative numbers in the context of accounting is seen in a number of ancient Indian works, including in the Bakshali manuscript from around the year 300 CE, where a negative number was written using a special symbol placed after the number (rather than before the number as we do today). The first general treatment of positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero all on an equal footing as equally-valid numbers on which one can perform the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and even division was given by Brahmagupta in his Brahma-sphuta-siddhanta in the year 628 CE.
