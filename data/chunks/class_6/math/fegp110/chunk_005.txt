The truck is at the ground level, but the minerals are present both above and qin: below the ground level. There is a fast = moving lift which moves up and down in a mineshaft carrying people and ore. Some of the levels are marked in the picture. The ground level is marked 0. Levels above the ground are marked by positive numbers and levels below the ground are marked by negative numbers. The number indicates how many metres above or below the ground level it is. In the mine, just like in the Building of Fun: Starting Level + Movement = Target Level For example, (+ 40) + (+ 60) =+100 ( 90) + (55) =-145 Target Level - Starting Level = Movement needed For example, (+ 40) -( 50)=+90 ( 90) (+ 40) =-130 eccccce e How many negative numbers are there? ------- . Bela s Building of Fun had only six floors above and five floors below. That is numbers 5 to + 6. In the mine above, we have numbers from 200 to +180. But we can imagine larger buildings or mineshafts. Just as positive numbers +1, +2, +3, ... keep going up without an end, similarly, negative numbers 1, 2, 3, ... keep going down. Positive and negative numbers, with zero, are called integers. They go both ways from 0: ... 4, 3, 2, -1, 0,1, 2, 3, 4, ...
