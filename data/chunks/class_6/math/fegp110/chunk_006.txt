Adding, subtracting, and comparing any numbers To add and subtract even larger integers, we can imagine even larger lifts! In fact, we can imagine a lift that can extend forever upwards and forever downwards, starting from Level 0. There does not even have to be any building or mine around just an infinite lift ! We can use this imagination to add and subtract any integers we like. For example, suppose we want to carry out the subtraction + 2000 (-200). We can imagine a lift with 2000 levels above the ground and 200 below the ground. Recall that, Target Level - Starting Level = Movement needed To go from the Starting Floor 200 to the Target Floor + 2000, we must press +2200 (+200 to get to zero, and then +2000 more after that to get to +2200). Therefore, (+ 2000) ( 200) = +2200. Notice that (+ 2000) + (+ 200) is also +2200. %e& Try evaluating the following expressions by similarly drawing or imagining a suitable lift: a. 125+(-30) b. +105-(-55) c. +105+(4+55) d. +80- ( 150) e. +80+(+150) f. -99-( 200) g. 99+(+200) h. +1500- C1500) Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd 251 @) 13-08-2024 17:32:08 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 In the above example, we saw that + 2000 -(- 200) = + 2000 + (+ 200) = +2200. In other words, subtracting a negative number is the same as adding the corresponding positive number. That is, we can replace subtraction of a negative number by addition of a positive number! ef In the other exercises that you did above, did you notice ; that subtracting a negative number was the same as adding a@, the corresponding positive number? Math an a Take a look at the infinite lift above. Does it remind you ] of a number line? In what ways? Back to the number line The infinite lift? we saw above looked very much like a number line, didn t it? In fact, if we rotate it by 90 , it basically becomes a number line. It also tells us how to complete the number ray to a number line, answering the question that we had asked at the beginning of the chapter. To the left of 0 are the negative numbers 1, 2, 3, ... Usually we drop the + sign on positive numbers and simply write them as 1, 2, 3, ... er a a re a re a 10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Instead of traveling along the number line using a lift, we can simply
