had asked at the beginning of the chapter. To the left of 0 are the negative numbers 1, 2, 3, ... Usually we drop the + sign on positive numbers and simply write them as 1, 2, 3, ... er a a re a re a 10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Instead of traveling along the number line using a lift, we can simply imagine walking on it. To the right is the positive (forward) direction, and to the left is the negative (backward) direction. Smaller numbers are now to the left of bigger numbers and bigger numbers are to the right of smaller numbers. So, 2 < 5; 3 <2; and-5 <-3. %f If, from 5 you wish to go over to 9, how far must you travel along the number line? 52) Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd 252 13-08-2024 17:32:09 The Other Side of Zero You must travel 4 steps. That is why 5+4 = 9. (Remember: Starting Number + Movement = Target Number) The corresponding subtraction statement is 9-5 =4. (Remember: Target Number - Starting Number = Movement needed) %e& Now, from 9, if you wish to go to 3, how much must you travel along the number line? (ONO 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 You must move 6 steps backward, i.e., you must move -6. Hence, we write 9 + (-6) = 3. (Remember again: Starting Number + Movement Number) = Target The corresponding subtraction statement is 3-9=-6.

Using the unmarked number line to add and subtract Just as youcan do additions, subtractions and comparisons with small numbers using the number line above, you can also do them with large numbers by imagining an infinite number line or drawing an unmarked number line as follows: a al This line shows only the position of zero. Other numbers are not marked. It can be convenient to use
