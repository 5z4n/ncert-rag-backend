positives (+5)-G4)=+1 take away 4 positives to see the result. Ces Let us subtract: Is (7) (-5) the same as ( 7) + (+5)? ( 7) (5) =-2 Example: Let us subtract: (+ 5) (+6). (+) (+) (+) (+) (+) Put down 5 positives. But there are not enough tokens to take out 6 positives! Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 To get around this issue, we can put out an extra zero pair (a positive and a negative), knowing that this does not change the value of the set of tokens. Now, we can take out 6 positives! 6 @ C See what is left: We conclude that (+5) (+6) =-1. (-) % Figure it Out 1. Evaluate the following differences using tokens. Check that you get the same result as with other methods you now know: a. (+10)-G7) b. (-8)-C4) c. (-9)-(-4) d. (+9)-( 12) e. (-5)-G7) f. (-2)-C6) 2. Complete the subtractions: a. (-5)-C7) b. (+10)-(+ 13) c. (-7)-C9) d. (+3)-( 8) e. (-2)-(-7) f. (+3)-@ 15) Example: +4 - (-6). Start with 4 positives. (+) (+) (+) (+) We have to take out 6 negatives from these. But there are not enough negatives. This is not a problem. We add some zero pairs as this does not change the value of the set of tokens. But how many zero pairs? We have to take away 6 negatives so we put down 6 zero pairs: Now we can take away 6 negatives: Therefore, + 4 ( 6)=+10. The Other Side of Zero % Figure it Out 1. Tryto subtract: - 3-(+5). How many zero pairs will you have to put in? What is the result? 2. Evaluate the following using tokens. a. ( 3) -(10) b. (+8)-(-7) c. (-5)-(9) d. (-9)-G 10) e. (+6)-(-4) f. (-2)-G7) 10.3 Integers in Other Places Credits and debits Suppose you open a bank account at your local bank with the %100 that you had been saving over the last month. Your bank balance therefore, starts at %100. Then you make 60 at your job the next day and you deposit it in your account. This is shown in your bank passbook as a credit . %& Your new bank balance is The next day you pay your electric bill of 30 using your bank account. This is shown in your bank passbook as a debit . %& Your bank balance is now The next day you make a major purchase for your business of 150. Again this is shown as a debit. %e& What is your bank balance now? Is this possible? Yes, some banks do allow your account balance to become negative, temporarily! Some banks also charge you an additional amount if your balance becomes negative, in the form of interest or a fee . Your strategic large purchase the previous day allows you to make, ~200 at your business the next day.
