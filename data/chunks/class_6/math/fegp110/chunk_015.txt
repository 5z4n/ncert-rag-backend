in the Bakshali manuscript from around the year 300 CE, where a negative number was written using a special symbol placed after the number (rather than before the number as we do today). The first general treatment of positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero all on an equal footing as equally-valid numbers on which one can perform the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and even division was given by Brahmagupta in his Brahma-sphuta-siddhanta in the year 628 CE. Brahmagupta gave clear and explicit rules for operations on all numbers positive, negative, and zero that essentially formed the modern way of understanding these numbers that we still use today! Some of Brahmagupta s key rules for addition and subtraction of positive numbers, negative numbers and zero are given below: Brahmagupta s Rules for Addition (Brahma-sphuta-siddhanta 18.30, 628 CE) 1. The sum of two positives is positive (e.g., 2 + 3 = 5). 2. The sum of two negatives is negative. To add two negatives, add the numbers (without the signs), and then place a minus sign to obtain the result (e.g., (-2) + (3) =-5). 3. To add a positive number and a negative number, subtract the smaller number (without the sign) from the greater number (without the sign), and place the sign of the greater number to obtain the result (e.g.,- 5+ 3=-2, 2+(-3)=-1and-3+5= 2). The sum of a number and its inverse is zero (e.g., 2 + ( 2) = 0). 5. The sum of any number and zero is the same number (e.g., 2 + 0 =-2and0+0=0).

Ifasmaller positive is subtracted from a larger positive, the result is positive (e.g., 3-2 = 1). 2. Ifalarger positive is subtracted from a smaller positive, the result is negative (e.g., 2-3 =- 1). 3. Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding the corresponding positive number (e.g., 2 ( 3) = 2 + 3). 4. Subtracting a number from itself gives zero (e.g., 2-2 =0 and -2( 2) = 0). 5. Subtracting zero from a number gives the same number (e.g., 2 0=-2 and 0- 0 = 0). Subtracting a number from zero gives the number s inverse (e.g., 0 ( 2) = 2). Once you understand Brahmagupta s rules, you can do addition and subtraction with any numbers whatsoever positive, negative, and zero! % Figure it Out 1. Can you explain each of Brahmagupta s rules in terms of Bela s Building of Fun, or in terms of a number line? 2. Give your own examples of each rule. Brahmagupta was the first to describe zero as a number on an equal footing with positive numbers as well as with negative numbers, and the first to give explicit rules for performing arithmetic operations on allsuch numbers, positive, negative, and zero forming what is now called a ring. It would change the way the world
