You can pick any of these and make an expression using addition(s) and subtraction(s). Here is an expression: (+18)+(+1)-(47) (-2) which gives a value (+14). Now, pick cards and make an expression such that its value is closer to (- 30). Ans. One of the ways is (-2) + (-9) (+18) (+1) = -30 Q.8 The sum of two positive integers is always positive but a (positive integer) (positive integer) can be positive or negative. What about a.
