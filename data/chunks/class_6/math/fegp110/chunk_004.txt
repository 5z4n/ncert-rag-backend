subtraction: 10 - 4 = 6 or Ten take away four is six. Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd 247 13-08-2024 17:32:08 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 You may also be familiar with another meaning of subtraction which is related to comparison or making quantities equal. For example, consider this situation: I have %10 with me and my sister has &6. Now, I can ask the question: How much more money should my sister get in order to have the same amount as me? We can write this in two ways:6+?=10 Or 10-6=? Here, we see the connection between finding the missing number to be added and subtraction. For subtraction of positive and negative numbers, we will use this meaning of subtraction as making equal or finding the missing number to be added . %& Evaluate 15-5, 100-10 and 74-34 from this perspective. -iaieiaieieleeaaieateleleeee 1 Teacher s Note ------------------ . In general, when there are two unequal quantities, subtraction can indicate the change needed to make the quantities equal. Subtraction shows how much the starting quantity should change in order to become the target quantity. In the context of different floor levels, what is the change required to reach the Target Floor from the Starting Floor? Notice that the change needed may be positive (for an increase) or negative (for a decrease). Your starting floor is the Art Centre and your target floor is the Sports Centre. What should be your button press? You need to go three floors up, so you should press +3. We can write this as an expression using subtraction: Target Floor Starting Floor = Movement needed. In the above example, the starting floor is +2 (Art Centre) and the target floor is +5. The button press to get to +5 from +2 is +3. Therefore, (+5)-G2)=+3 Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd 248 13-08-2024 17:32:08 The Other Side of Zero Explanation Recall the connection between addition and subtraction. For 3+ ?=5, we can find the missing number using subtraction: 5-3=2. That is, subtraction is the same as finding the missing number to be added. We know that Starting Floor + Movement needed = Target Floor If the movement needed is to be found, then, Starting Floor + ? = Target Floor SO, Target Floor - Starting Floor = ? = Movement needed More examples: a. If the Target Floor is 1 and Starting Floor is -2, what button should you press? You need to go one floor up, so, you should press + 1. Expression: ( 1) - (2) = (+1) b. If the Target Floor is -1 and Starting floor is +3, what button should you press? You need to go four floors down, so, you should press 4. Expression: ( 1) - (+ 3) = (4) c. Ifthe Target Floor is +2 and Starting Floor is 2, what button should you press? You need to go four floors up, so, you should press +4. Expression: (+ 2)-( 2) =(+4)
