to think of the concept of inverse. If you are at Floor +4 and you press its inverse 4, then you are back to zero, the ground floor! If you are at Floor 2 and press its inverse +2, then you go to ( 2) + (+2) = 0, again the ground floor! xf Write the inverses of these numbers: +4, -4, -3, 0, +2, -1. %* Connect the inverses by drawing lines. ) QA & 9) &) Comparing numbers using floors #0 Who is on the lowest floor? 1. Jay isin the Art Centre. So, he is on Floor +2. 2. Asin is in the Sports Centre. So, she is on Floor __. 3. Binnu is in the Cinema Centre. So,sheison Floor. 4. Amanis in the Toys Store.

We also write +4 > +3. % Should we write -3 < 4 or -4 < -3? H Floor 4 is lower than Floor 3. So, 4 < 3. It is also correct to write 3 > -4 % Figure it Out 1. Compare the following numbers using the Building of Fun and fill in the boxes with < or >. a. -2(__)+5 b. -5( )+4 cc. -5( )-3 d. +6( )-6 e. O( )-4 f. Of )+4 Notice that all negative number floors are below Floor 0. So, all negative numbers are less than 0. All the positive number floors are above Floor 0. So, all 0 positive numbers are greater than 0. D 2. Imagine the Building of Fun with more floors. Compare the numbers and fill in the boxes with < or >: a. -10 (_)-12 b. +17 (_} -10 c. 0 ( )-20 d. +9 { )-9 e. -25 ( )-7 f. +15( )-17 3. If Floor A = - 12, Floor D = -1 and Floor E = +1 in the building shown on the right as a line, find the numbers of Floors B, C, F, G, and H. (o) 4. Mark the following floors of the building shown on a. -7 b. -4 c. +3 d. 10 Subtraction to find which button to press In earlier classes, we understood the meaning of subtraction as take away . For example, there are 10 books on the shelf. I take away 4 books. How many are left on the shelf? We can express the answer using subtraction: 10 - 4 = 6 or Ten take away four is six. Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd 247 13-08-2024 17:32:08 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 You may also be familiar with another meaning of subtraction which is related to comparison or making quantities equal. For example, consider this situation: I have %10 with me and my sister has &6. Now, I can ask the question: How much more money should my sister get in order to
