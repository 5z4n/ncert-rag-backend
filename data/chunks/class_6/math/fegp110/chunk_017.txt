Addition can also be interpreted as the combination of movements or increases/decreases: Movement 1 + Movement 2 = Total Movement. m Subtraction can be interpreted as Target Position Starting Position = Movement. Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd 269 13-08-2024 17:32:43 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 m Ingeneral, we can add two numbers by following Brahmagupta s Rules for Addition: a. If both numbers are positive, add the numbers and the result is a positive number (e.g., 2 + 3 = 5). b. Ifboth numbers are negative, add the numbers (without the signs), and then place a minus sign to obtain the result ( 2 + (-3) = 5). c. If one number is positive and the other is negative, subtract the smaller number (without the sign) from the greater number (without the sign), and place the sign of the greater number to obtain the result (e.g.,-5 + 3 = 2). d. Anumber plus its additive inverse is zero (e.g., 2 + (2) = 0). e. A number plus zero gives back the same number (e.g., 2 + 0 = 2). m Wecan subtract two integers by converting the problem into an addition problem and then following the rules of addition. Subtraction of an integer is the same as the addition of its additive inverse. m Integers can be compared: ... -3 <-2 <-1<0<+1<+2<+3<... Smaller numbers are to the left of larger numbers on the number line. m Wecan give meaning to positive and negative numbers by interpreting them as credits and debits. We can also interpret positive numbers as distances above a reference point like the ground level. Similarly, negative numbers can be interpreted as distances below the ground level. When measuring temperatures in degrees Celsius, positive temperatures are those above the freezing point of water, and negative temperatures are those below the freezing point of water.

Both players start at 0. Players can reach either 50 or +50 to win but need not decide or fix this before or during play. e Each player rolls two dice at a time. One dice has numbers from +1 to +6 and the other dice has numbers from -1 to -6. e After each roll of the two dice, the player can add or subtract them in any order and then move the steps that indicate the result. A positive result means moving towards +50 and a negative result means moving towards 50.
