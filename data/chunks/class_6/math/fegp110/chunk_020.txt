D = 1 and Floor E = + 1 in the building shown on the right as a line, find the numbers of Floors B, C, F, G and H. Ans. B=-9 C=-6 F=+2 G=+6H=+11 Q.4. Mark the following floors of the building shown on the right. a. -7 b. -4 c. +3 d. -10 Ans. a.P=-7 b.Q=-4 c.R=43 d.S=-10 Page 248 Q. Evaluate 15 5, 100 10 and 74 34 from this perspective. e 15-5 can be expressed as 5+?=15.So,?= 10 e 100-10 can be expressed as 10 + ? = 100. So, ? = 90 e 74-34 can be expressed as 34 +? = 74. So, ? = 40 Page No. 249 Figure it out Q. Complete these expressions. You may think of them as finding the movement needed to reach the Target Floor from the Starting Floor. a. (+ 1)- (+ 4) b.

In the other exercises that you did above, did you notice that subtracting a negative number was the same as adding the corresponding positive number? Ans. Yes. The infinite lift reminds us of a number line. Q. If, from 5 you wish to go over to 9, how far must you travel along the number line? Ans. 4steps. Q. Now, from 9, if you wish to go to 3, how much must you travel along the number line? Ans. One must travel 6 steps backward or move (-6) from 9 to go to 3. Q. Now, from 3, if you wish to go to 2, how far must you travel? Ans. One must travel 5 steps backward or move (-5) from 3 to go to -2.
