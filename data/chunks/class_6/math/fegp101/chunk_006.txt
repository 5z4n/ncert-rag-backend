needed, can you say what is the sum of the first 100 odd numbers? Ans.10000 * Figure it out Q.1. Can you find a similar pictorial explanation for why adding counting numbers up and down, ie., 1,1+2+1,1+2+3+2+1,..., gives square numbers? Ans. One of the ways is 1 1+2+1 1+2+3+2+1 = = 11+2+1,1+2+3+4+2+1,..., Q.2. By imagining a large version of your picture, or drawing it partially, as needed, can you see what will be the value of 1+2+3+...+99+100+99+..4+34+2+1? Ans. 10,000 Q.3. Which sequence do you get when you start to add the All 1 s sequence up? What sequence do you get when you add the All 1 s sequence up and down? Ans. e 14+(141)+( +141) + + 14141)... e 1, 14+(1+1) +1, 14141) +(14141) + 141) +1, 14041) +(14141) + (1414141) 4 (1+14+1) + (141) +1, 200... Q.4. Which sequence do you get when you start to add the Counting numbers up? Can you give a smaller pictorial explanation? Ans. 1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+24+3+4, 0.0.0... Which is triangular number sequence. For pictorial representation refer Table 2 on page 4 (Try it for isosceles right triangle also.) [3] Q.5. What happens when you add up pairs of consecutive triangular numbers? That is, take 1+ 3,3+6,6+10, 10+ 15, ... ? Which sequence do you get? Why? Can you explain it with a picture? Ans. We get: 4, 9, 16, 25, ......... (Square numbers). For the pictorial representation refer Table 2 on page 4 Q.6. What happens when you start to add up powers of 2 starting with 1, i.e., take 1, 1+ 2,1+2+4,14+2+4+8,...?2 Now add 1 to each of these numbers what numbers do you get? Why does this happen? Ans. e We get, 1,3, 7, 15,31, ............ e After adding | to each number, we get:2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...... Refer the picture on page 6. Q.7. What happens when you multiply the triangular numbers by 6 and add 1? Which sequence do you get? Can you explain it with a picture? Ans. (1x6) +1, (3x6) +1, (66) +1, (10x6) +1, (156) +1, ... = 7,19, 37, 61, 91, .... For picture refer picture in Q.4 page 5. Q.8. What happens when you start to add up hexagonal numbers, i.e., take 1, 1 + 7, 1+7+19,1+7+19 +37, ... ? Which sequence do you get? Can you explain it using a picture of a cube? Ans. 1, 8, 27, 64, ......... We get cube numbers. For picture, refer Table 2, page 4 Page no. 10 Section 1.5 Figure it out Q.1. Can you recognise the pattern in each of the sequences in Table 3? Ans. Yes. > 3,4,5, 6,7, 8, 9, 10 One of the ways to interpret this is that we get a sequence of number of sides of the pictures of the shapes > 1,3, 6, 10, 15 > 1,4, 9, 16, 25 > 1,4, 9, 16, 25 & 3,34, 3x4x4, 3x4x4x4, 3x4x4x4x4 [4] Page no. 11 Section 1.6 %* Figure it out Q.1. Count the number of
