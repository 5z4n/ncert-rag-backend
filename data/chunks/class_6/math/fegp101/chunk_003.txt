of consecutive triangular numbers? That is, take 1 + 3,3 +6,6+10,10 +15, ... Which sequence do you get? Why? Can you explain it with a picture? What happens when you start to add up powers of 2 starting with 1, ie, take 1,1+2,1+2+4,1+2+4+8,... ? Now add 1 to each of these numbers what numbers do you get? Why does this happen? Reprint 2025-26 13-08-2024 16:10:53 Patterns in Mathematics 7. What happens when you multiply the triangular numbers by 6 and add 1? Which sequence do you get? Can you explain it with a picture? 8. What happens when you start to add up hexagonal numbers, Le., take 1,1+7,1+7+19,1+7+19 + 37,...? Which sequence do you get? Can you explain it using a picture of a cube? 9. Find your own patterns or relations in and among the sequences in Table 1. Can you explain why they happen with a picture or otherwise? 1.5 Patterns in Shapes Other important and basic patterns that occur in Mathematics are patterns of shapes. These shapes may be in one, two, or three dimensions (1D, 2D, or 3D) or in even more dimensions. The branch of Mathematics that studies patterns in shapes is called geometry. Shape sequences are one important type of shape pattern that mathematicians study. Table 3 shows a few key shape sequences that are studied in Mathematics.

Can you recognise the pattern in each of the sequences in ! 32, Table 3? 2. Try and redraw each sequence in Table 3 in your notebook. \ Jalk Can you draw the next shape in each sequence? Why or why not? After each sequence, describe in your own words what is the rule or pattern for forming the shapes in the sequence. 1.6 Relation to Number Sequences Often, shape sequences are related to number sequences in surprising ways. Such relationships can be helpful in studying and understanding both the shape sequence and the related number sequence. Example: The number of sides in the shape sequence of Regular Polygons is given by the counting numbers starting at 3, Le., 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, .... That is why these shapes are called, respectively, regular triangle, quadrilateral (i.e., square), pentagon, hexagon, heptagon, octagon, nonagon, decagon, etc., respectively. The word regular refers to the fact that these shapes have equal-length sides and also equal angles (i.e., the sides look the same and the corners also look the same). We will discuss angles in more depth in the next chapter. The other shape sequences in Table 3 also have beautiful relationships with number sequences. % Figure it Out 1. Count the number of sides in each shape in the sequence of Regular Polygons. Which number sequence do you get?
