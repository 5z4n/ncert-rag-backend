PATTERNS IN cae MATHEMATICS Elst 1.1 What is Mathematics? Mathematics is, in large part, the search for patterns, and for the explanations as to why those patterns exist. Such patterns indeed exist all around us in nature, in our homes and schools, and in the motion of the sun, moon, and stars. They occur in everything that we do and see, from shopping and cooking, to throwing a ball and playing games, to understanding weather patterns and using technology. The search for patterns and their explanations can be a fun and creative endeavour. It is for this reason that mathematicians think of mathematics both as an art and as ascience. This year, we hope that you will get a chance to see the creativity and artistry involved in discovering and understanding mathematical patterns. It is important to keep in mind that mathematics aims to not just find out what patterns exist, but also the explanations for why they exist. Such explanations can often then be used in applications well beyond the context in which they were discovered, which can then help to propel humanity forward.

Can you think of other examples where mathematics helps us in our everyday lives? 2. Howhas mathematics helped propel humanity forward? (You sat might think of examples involving: carrying out scientific experiments; running our economy and democracy; building bridges, houses or other complex structures; making TVs, mobile phones, computers, bicycles, trains, cars, planes, calendars, clocks, etc.) 1.2 Patterns in Numbers Among the most basic patterns that occur in mathematics are patterns of numbers, particularly patterns of whole numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... The branch of Mathematics that studies patterns in whole numbers is called number theory. Number sequences are the most basic and among the most fascinating types of patterns that mathematicians study. Table 1 shows some key number sequences that are studied in Mathematics.
