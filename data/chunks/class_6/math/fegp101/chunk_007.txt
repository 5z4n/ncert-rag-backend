Q.1. Can you recognise the pattern in each of the sequences in Table 3? Ans. Yes. > 3,4,5, 6,7, 8, 9, 10 One of the ways to interpret this is that we get a sequence of number of sides of the pictures of the shapes > 1,3, 6, 10, 15 > 1,4, 9, 16, 25 > 1,4, 9, 16, 25 & 3,34, 3x4x4, 3x4x4x4, 3x4x4x4x4 [4] Page no. 11 Section 1.6 %* Figure it out Q.1. Count the number of sides in each shape in the sequence of Regular Polygons. Which number sequence do you get? What about the number of corners in each shape in the sequence of Regular Polygons? Do you get the same number sequence? Can you explain why this happens? Ans. e Number of sides = 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10... We get counting number sequence, starting with 3. e Number of Corners = 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10... Yes, we get the same number sequence e inany closed figure, number of sides = number of corners (vertices). Q.2. Count the number of lines in each shape in the sequence of Complete Graphs. Which number sequence do you get? Can you explain why? Ans. e 1,3, 6, 10, 15. This is a Triangle number sequence Q.3. How many little squares are there in each shape of the sequence of Stacked Squares? Which number sequence does this give? Can you explain why? Ans. e 61,4, 9, 16, 25. This is a Square number sequence. e Squares can be drawn using these number of dots. Q.4. How many little triangles are there in each shape of the sequence of Stacked Triangles? Which number sequence does this give? Can you explain why? (Hint: In each shape in the sequence, how many triangles are there in each row?) Ans. 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 = 1, 14241, 142434241, oe Square number sequence (As adding up and down) gives us square number sequence. Q.5. To get from one shape to the next shape in the Koch Snowflake sequence, one replaces each line segment by a speed bump . As one does this more and more times, the changes become tinier and tinier with very very small line segments. How many total line segments are there in each shape of the Koch Snowflake? What is the corresponding number sequence? (The answer is 3, 12, 48, ..., Le. 3 times Powers of 4; this sequence is not shown in Table 1) Ans. Total line segments in each shape: 3, 12, 48, 192, 768 Corresponding sequence: 3, 3x4, 3x4x4, 3x4x4x4x, 3x4x4x4x4,... [5]
