pattern in mathematics. Some important examples of shape sequences include regular polygons, complete graphs, stacked triangles and squares, and Koch snowflake iterations. Shape sequences also exhibit many interesting relationships with number sequences.

Can you think of other examples where mathematics helps us in our everyday lives? Ans. Some examples are paying for fruits, vegetables, groceries etc. calculation of speed of vehicles, designs or patterns in different buildings, finding area of any plot or out own home. There could be many more such contexts in our everyday lives. Discuss for other examples also. Q2. How has mathematics helped propel humanity forward? (You might think of examples involving: carrying out scientific experiments; running our economy and democracy; building bridges, houses or other complex structures; making TVs, mobile phones, computers, bicycles, trains, cars, planes, calendars, clocks, etc.) Ans. Teacher student discussion is required. Page No. 3. Section 1.2 Os Figure it Out Q.1. Can you recognize the pattern in each of the sequences in Table 1? Ans. Yes, There is a pattern in each case. Powers of 2- 1,2,4=2x2,8=2x2x2,16=2x2x2x2x2... Powers of 3 - 1,3,9=3x3=27=3 x3 x3,... Virahanka numbers- 1,2, 3,5 =2+3,8=3+5,13=5+8..... Rest of the patterns have been shown on page 4 ,Table 2 Page no. 5 Section 1.3 % Figure it out Q.2. Why are 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ... called triangular numbers? Why are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ... Ans. called square numbers or squares? Why are 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, ... called cubes? Refer Table 2, page 4, and check for yourself. Q.3. You will have noticed that 36 is both a triangular number and a square number! That is, 36 dots can be arranged perfectly both in a triangle and in a square. Make pictures in your notebook illustrating this! Ans. Refer Table 2, page 4, and draw. [1] Q.4. What would you call the following sequence of numbers? Ans. 61. Q.5. Can you think of pictorial ways to visualise the sequence of powers of 2? powers of 3? Ans. Sequence of powers of 2 given on page 6 Sequence of powers of 3- One of the ways could be Dk eS Page No. 7 Section 1.4 * By drawing a similar picture, can you say what is the sum of the first 10 odd numbers? Ans. 100 [2] Now by imagining a similar picture, or by drawing it partially, as needed, can you say what is the sum of the first 100 odd numbers? Ans.10000 * Figure it out Q.1. Can you find a similar pictorial explanation for why adding counting numbers up and down, ie., 1,1+2+1,1+2+3+2+1,..., gives square numbers? Ans. One of the ways is 1 1+2+1 1+2+3+2+1 = = 11+2+1,1+2+3+4+2+1,..., Q.2. By imagining a large version of your picture, or drawing it partially, as needed, can you see what will be the value of 1+2+3+...+99+100+99+..4+34+2+1? Ans. 10,000 Q.3.
