can be related to each other in surprising ways. Example: What happens when we start adding up odd numbers? 1=1 1+3=4 1+3+5=9 1+3+5+7=16 1+3+5+7+9=25 1+3+5+7+9+11=36 This is a really beautiful pattern! 4 Why does this happen? Do you think it will happen forever? The answer is that the pattern does happen forever. But why? As mentioned earlier, the reason why the pattern happens is just as important and exciting as the pattern itself. A picture can explain it Visualising with a picture can help explain the phenomenon. Recall that square numbers are made by counting the number of dots ina square grid. ) % How can we partition the dots in a square grid into odd numbers of dots: 1, 3, 5, 7,... ? Talk Think about it for a moment before reading further! (6) Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 1_Patterns in Mathematics.indd 6 13-08-2024 16:10:53 Patterns in Mathematics Here is how it can be done: This picture now makes it evident that 1+3+5+7+9+11 = 36. Because such a picture can be made for a square of any size, this explains why adding up odd numbers gives square numbers. %e& By drawing a similar picture, can you say what is the sum of the first 10 odd numbers? %e& Now by imagining a similar picture, or by drawing it partially, as needed, can you say what is the sum of the first 100 odd numbers? Another example of such a relation between sequences: Adding up and down Let us look at the following pattern: 1=1 1+2+1=4 1+2+3+2+1=9 1+2+3+4+3+2+1=16 14+2+3+4+5+4+3+2+1=25 14+2+3+4+5+6+5+4+3+2+1=36 This seems to be giving yet another way of getting the square numbers by adding the counting numbers up and then down!

Which sequence do you get when you start to add the All 1 s sequence up? What sequence do you get when you add the All 1 s sequence up and down? Which sequence do you get when you start to add the counting numbers up? Can you give a smaller pictorial explanation? What happens when you add up pairs of consecutive triangular numbers? That is, take 1 + 3,3 +6,6+10,10 +15, ... Which sequence do you get? Why? Can you explain it with a picture? What happens when you start to add up powers of 2 starting with 1, ie, take 1,1+2,1+2+4,1+2+4+8,... ? Now add 1 to each of these numbers what numbers do you get? Why does this happen?
