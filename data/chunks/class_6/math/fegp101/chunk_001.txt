Rewrite each sequence of Table 1 in your notebook, along \ Talk with the next three numbers in each sequence! After each sequence, write in your own words what is the rule for forming the numbers in the sequence. 1.3 Visualising Number Sequences Many number sequences can be visualised using pictures. Visualising mathematical objects through pictures or diagrams can be a very fruitful way to understand mathematical patterns and concepts. Let us represent the first seven sequences in Table 1 using the following pictures.

You will have noticed that 36 is both a triangular number and a square number! That is, 36 dots can be arranged perfectly both in a triangle and in a square. Make pictures in your notebook illustrating this! This shows that the same number can be represented differently, and play different roles, depending on the context. Try representing some other numbers pictorially in different ways! 4.

Example: What happens when we start adding up odd numbers? 1=1 1+3=4 1+3+5=9 1+3+5+7=16 1+3+5+7+9=25 1+3+5+7+9+11=36 This is a really beautiful pattern! 4 Why does this happen? Do you think it will happen forever? The answer is that the pattern does happen forever. But why? As mentioned earlier, the reason why the pattern happens is just as important and exciting as the pattern itself. A picture can explain it Visualising with
