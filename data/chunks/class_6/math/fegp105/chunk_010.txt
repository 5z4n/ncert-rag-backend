12 is not included in the prime factorisation of 42. This is because 2 occurs twice in the prime factorisation of 12 but only once in the prime factorisation of 42. This means that 42 is not divisible by 12. We can say that if one number is divisible by another, then the prime factorisation of the second number is included in the prime factorisation of the first number. % Figure it Out 1. Are the following pairs of numbers co-prime? Guess first and then use prime factorisation to verify your answer. a. 30and 45 b. 57 and 85 c. 121 and 1331 d. 343 and 216 2. Isthefirstnumber divisible by the second? Use prime factorisation. a. 225 and 27 b. 96 and 24 c. 343 and 17 d. 999 and 99 3. The first number has prime factorisation 2 x 3 x 7 and the second number has prime factorisation 3 x 7 x 11. Are they co-prime? Does one of them divide the other? 4. Guna says, Any two prime numbers are co-prime? . Is he right? 5.5 Divisibility Tests So far, we have been finding factors of numbers in different contexts, including to determine if a number is prime or not, or if a given pair of numbers is co-prime or not. Prime Time It is easy to find factors of small numbers. How do we find factors of a large number? Let us take 8560. Does it have any factors from 2 to 10 (2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 9, 10)? It is easy to check if some of these numbers are factors or not without doing long division. Can you find them? Divisibility by 10 Let us take 10. Is 8560 divisible by 10? This is another way of asking if 10 is a factor of 8560. For this, we can look at the pattern in the multiples of 10. The first few multiples of 10 are: 10, 20, 30, 40, ... Continue this sequence and observe the pattern. Is 125 a multiple of 10? Will this number appear in the previous sequence? Why or why not? Can you now answer if 8560 is divisible by 10? % Consider this statement: ! 52, Numbers that are divisible by 10 are those that end with Math y a 0 . Do you agree? Divisibility by 5 The number 5 is another number whose divisibility can easily be checked. How do we do it? Explore by listing down the multiples: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ... What do you observe about these numbers? Do you see a pattern in the last digit? What is the largest number less than 399 that is divisible by 5? Is 8560 divisible by 5? %& Consider this statement: | @ Numbers that are divisible by 5 are those that end with either a 0 or a 5 . Do you agree? < Divisibility by 2 The first few multiples of 2 are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18,
