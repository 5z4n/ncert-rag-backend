However, as we Saw in these examples, there are many ways to arrive at the prime factorisation! Does the order matter? Using this diagram, can you explain why 30 = 2 x 3 x 5, no matter which way you multiply 2, 3, and 5? When multiplying numbers, we can do so in any order. The end result is the same. That is why, when two 2s and two 3s are multiplied in any order, we get 36. In a later class, we shall study this under the names of commutativity and associativity of multiplication. Thus, the order does not matter. Usually we write the prime numbers in increasing order. For example, 225=3x3x5x5 or 30= 2x3x 5. Prime factorisation of a product of two numbers When we find the prime factorisation of a number, we first write it as a product of two factors. For example, 72 = 12 x 6. Then, we find the prime factorisation of each of the factors. In the above example, 12=2x2x3and6=2 x3.Now, can you say what the prime factorisation of 72 is? The prime factorisation of the original number is obtained by putting these together. 72=2x2x3x2x3 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 We can also write this as 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3. Multiply and check that you get 72 back! Observe how many times each prime factor occurs in the factorisation of 72. Compare it with how many times it occurs in the factorisations of 12 and 6 put together. % Figure it Out 1. Find the prime factorisations of the following numbers: 64, 104, 105, 243, 320, 141, 1728, 729, 1024, 1331, 1000. 2. The prime factorisation of a number has one 2, two 3s, and one 11. What is the number? 3. Find three prime numbers, all less than 30, whose product is 1955. Find the prime factorisation ofthese numbers without multiplying first a. 56x25 b. 108x75 c. 1000 x 81 5. What is the smallest number whose prime factorisation has: a. three different prime numbers? b. four different prime numbers? Prime factorisation is of fundamental importance in the study of numbers. Let us discuss two ways in which it can be useful. Using prime factorisationto check if two numbers are co-prime Let us again take the numbers 56 and 63. How can we check if they are co-prime? We can use the prime factorisation of both numbers 56=2x2x2x7and63=3x3x7 Now, we see that 7 is a prime factor of 56 as well as 63. Therefore, 56 and 63 are not co-prime. What about 80 and 63? Their prime factorisations are as follows: 80=2x2x2x2x5and63=3x3x7 There are no common prime factors. Can we conclude that they are co-prime? Suppose they have a common factor that is composite. Would the prime factors of this composite common factor appear in the prime factorisation of 80 and 63? Prime Time Se ee a a a a ap a a a a a 4b ap a ~~ a ap ab a a a a
