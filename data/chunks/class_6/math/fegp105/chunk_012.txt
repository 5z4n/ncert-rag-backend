original number is divisible by 4. 3. If the original number is divisible by 4, then the number formed by the last two digits is divisible by 4. Do you agree? Why or why not? Prime Time Divisibility by 8 Interestingly, even checking for divisibility by 8 can be simplified. Can the last two digits be used for this? %e Find numbers between 120 and 140 that are divisible by 8. Also find numbers between 1120 and 1140, and 3120 and 3140, that are divisible by 8. What do you observe? % Change the last two digits of 8560 so that the resulting number is a multiple of 8. %& Consider these statements: 1. Only the last three digits matter when deciding if a ._) given number is divisible by 8. Math 2. Ifthenumber formed by the last three digits is divisible by 8, then the original number is divisible by 8. 3. Ifthe original number is divisible by 8, then the number formed by the last three digits is divisible by 8. Do you agree? Why or why not? RE We have seen that long division is not always needed to check ifa number is a factor or not. We have made use of certain observations to come up with simple methods for 10, 5, 2, 4, 8. Do we have such simple methods for other numbers as well? We will discuss simple methods to test divisibility by 3, 6,7, and 9 in later classes! % Figure it Out 1. 2024 is a leap year (as February has 29 days). Leap years occur in the years that are multiples of 4, except for those years that are evenly divisible by 100 but not 400. a. From the year you were born till now, which years were leap years? b. From the year 2024 till 2099, how many leap years are there? 2. Find the largest and smallest 4-digit numbers that are divisible by 4 and are also palindromes. 3. Explore and find out if each statement is always true, sometimes true or never true. You can give examples to support your reasoning. Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 a a i i a a A a a a A a A A a a eas a. Sum of two even numbers gives a multiple of 4. b. Sum of two odd numbers gives a multiple of 4. 4. Find the remainders obtained when each of the following numbers are divided by (a) 10, (b) 5, (c) 2. 78, 99, 173, 572, 980, 1111, 2345 5. The teacher asked if 14560 is divisible by all of 2, 4, 5, 8 and 10. Guna checked for divisibility of 14560 by only two of these numbers and then declared that it was also divisible by all of them. What could those two numbers be? 6. Which of the following numbers are divisible by all of 2, 4, 5, 8 and 10: 572, 2352, 5600, 6000, 77622160. 7. Write two numbers whose product is
