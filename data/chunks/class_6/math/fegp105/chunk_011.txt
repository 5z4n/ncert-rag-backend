do you observe about these numbers? Do you see a pattern in the last digit? What is the largest number less than 399 that is divisible by 5? Is 8560 divisible by 5? %& Consider this statement: | @ Numbers that are divisible by 5 are those that end with either a 0 or a 5 . Do you agree? < Divisibility by 2 The first few multiples of 2 are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, ... What do you observe? Do you see a pattern in the last digit? Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 Is 682 divisible by 2? Can we answer this without doing the long division? Is 8560 divisible by 2? Why or why not? %& Consider this statement: Numbers that are divisible by 2 are those that end with 0 , a& 2 , 4, 6 or 8 . Do you agree? What are all the multiples of 2 between 399 and 411? Divisibility by 4 Checking if a number is divisible by 4 can also be done easily! Look at its multiples: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, ... Are you able to observe any patterns that can be used? The multiples of 10, 5 and 2 have a pattern in their last digits which we are able to use to check for divisibility. Similarly, can we check if a number is divisible by 4 by looking at the last digit? It does not work! Look at 12 and 22. They have the same last digit, but 12 is a multiple of 4 while 22 is not. Similarly 14 and 24 have the same last digit, but 14 is not a multiple of 4 while 24 is. Similarly, 16 and 26 or 18 and 28. What this means is that by looking at the last digit, we cannot tell whether a number is a multiple of 4. Can we answer the question by looking at more digits? Make a list of multiples of 4 between 1 and 200 and search for a pattern. % Find numbers between 330 and 340 that are divisible by 4. Also, find numbers between 1730 and 1740, and 2030 and 2040, that are divisible by 4. What do you observe? %F Is 8536 divisible by 4? %& Consider these statements: 1. Only the last two digits matter when deciding if a given number is divisible by 4. 2. If the number formed by the last two digits is divisible by 4, then the original number is divisible by 4. 3. If the original number is divisible by 4, then the number formed by the last two digits is divisible by 4. Do you agree? Why or why not? Prime Time Divisibility by 8 Interestingly, even checking for divisibility by 8 can be simplified. Can the last two digits be used for this? %e Find numbers between 120 and 140 that are divisible by 8. Also find numbers between 1120 and 1140, and 3120
