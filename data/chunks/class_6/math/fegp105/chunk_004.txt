Step 5: Continue this process till all the numbers in the list are either circled or crossed out. All the circled numbers are prime It is definitely not some numbers. All the crossed out numbers, oie ty itworke y other than 1, are composite numbers. This method is called the Sieve of Eratosthenes. This procedure can be carried on for numbers greater than 100 also. Eratosthenes was a Greek mathematician who lived around 2200 years ago and developed this method of listing primes. Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 Guna and Anshu started wondering how this simple method is able to find prime numbers! Think how this method works. Read the steps given above again and see what happens after each step is carried out. % Figure it Out 1. eocccs emotes 2 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Prime numbers are the building blocks of all whole numbers. Starting from the time of the Greek civilisation (more than 2000 years ago) to this day, mathematicians are still struggling to uncover their secrets! Food for thought: is there a largest prime number? Or does the list of prime numbers go on without an end? A mathematician named Euclid found the answer and so will you in a later class! Fun fact: The largest prime number that anyone has written down is so large that it would take around 6500 pages to write it! So they could only write it on a computer! See We see that 2 is a prime and also an even number. Is there any other even prime? Look at the list of primes till 100. What is the smallest difference between two successive primes? What is the largest difference? Are there an equal number of primes occurring in every row in the table on the previous page? Which decades have the least number of primes? Which have the most number of primes? -------------------------------- = -- == - 5 - = = i Primes through the Ages ce ea Which of the following numbers are prime: 23, 51, 37, 26? Write three pairs of prime numbers less than 20 whose sum is a multiple of 5. The numbers 13 and 31 are prime numbers. Both these numbers have same digits 1 and 3. Find such pairs of prime numbers up to 100. Find seven consecutive composite numbers between 1 and 100. Twin primes are pairs of primes having a difference of 2. For example, 3 and 5 are twin primes. So are
