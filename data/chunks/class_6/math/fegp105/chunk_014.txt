factors, namely 1 and themselves. = Composite numbers are numbers like 4, 6, 8, 9, ... that have more than 2 factors, i.e., at least one factor other than 1 and themselves. For example, 8 has the factor 4 and 9 has the factor 3, so 8 and 9 are both composite. = Every number greater than 1 can be written as a product of prime numbers. This is called the number s prime factorisation. For example, 84=2x2x3x7. = There is only one way to factorise a number into primes, except for the ordering of the factors. = Two numbers that do not have a common factor other than 1 are said to be co-prime. = To check if two numbers are co-prime, we can first find their prime factorisations and check if there is a common prime factor. If there is no common prime factor, they are co-prime, and otherwise they are not. = A number is a factor of another number if the prime factorisation of the first number is included in the prime factorisation of the second number. CHAPTER 5 SOLUTIONS Prime Time Section 5.1 Page no. 108 -O Figure it out Q.1. At what number is idli-vada said for the 10th time? Ans. 150. Q.2. If the game is played for the numbers from 1 till 90, find out: a. How many times would the children say idli (including the times they say idlivada )? Ans. 30 times. b. How many times would the children say vada (including the times they say idlivada )? Ans. 18 times. c. How many times would the children say idli-vada ? Ans. 6 times. Q.3. What if the game was played till 900? How would your answers change? Ans. Ifthe game was played till 900, idli-vada would be said 60 times by the children. * Vada will be said 180 time and idli will be said 300 times. Q.4. Is this figure somehow related to the idli-vada game? Hint: Imagine playing the game till 30. Draw the figure if the game is played till 60. Ans. Yes, the common numbers represent the numbers when to say idli-vada . Multiple of 3 Multiple of 5 Page no. 109 Which of the following could be the other number: 2, 3, 5, 8, 10? Ans. The other number will be 8. Page no. 110 -O Q. What jump size can reach both 15 and 30? There are multiple jump sizes possible. Try to find them all. Ans. Jump size of 3 or 5 will take us to 15 & 30. Other possible jump sizes are 1, 15. -O Q.1. Is there anything common among the shaded numbers? Ans. All shaded numbers are multiples of 3. -O Q.2. Is there anything common among the circled numbers? Ans. All circled numbers are multiples of 4. :Os Q.3. Which numbers are both shaded and circled? What are these numbers called? Ans. 36,48, 60. These numbers are called common multiples of 3 and 4.
