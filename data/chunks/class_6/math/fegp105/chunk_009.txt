are not co-prime. What about 80 and 63? Their prime factorisations are as follows: 80=2x2x2x2x5and63=3x3x7 There are no common prime factors. Can we conclude that they are co-prime? Suppose they have a common factor that is composite. Would the prime factors of this composite common factor appear in the prime factorisation of 80 and 63? Prime Time Se ee a a a a ap a a a a a 4b ap a ~~ a ap ab a a a a aa a ~~ a 4p a a 4p a a a a a, Therefore, we can say that if there are no common prime factors, then the two numbers are co-prime. Let us see some examples. Example: Consider 40 and 231. Their prime factorisations are as follows: 40=2x2x2x5and231=3x7x11 We see that there are no common primes that divide both 40 and 231. Indeed, the prime factors of 40 are 2 and 5 while, the prime factors of 231 are 3, 7, and 11. Therefore, 40 and 231 are co-prime! Example: Consider 242 and 195. Their prime factorisations are as follows: 242 =2x 11x 11and195=3 x5 x 13 The prime factors of 242 are 2 and 11. The prime factors of 195 are 3,5, and 13. There are no common prime factors. Therefore, 242 and 195 are co-prime. Using prime factorisation to check if one number is divisible by another We can say that if one number is divisible by another, the prime factorisation of the second number is included in the prime factorisation of the first number. We say that 48 is divisible by 12 because when we divide 48 by 12, the remainder is zero. How can we check if one number is divisible by another without carrying out long division? Example: Is 168 divisible by 12? Find the prime factorisations of both: 168=2x2x2x3x7and12=2x2x3 Since we can multiply in any order, now it is clear that, 168=2x2x3x2x7=12x14 Therefore, 168 is divisible by 12. Example: Is 75 divisible by 21? Find the prime factorisations of both: 75=3x5x5and21=3x7 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 As we Saw in the discussion above, if 75 was a multiple of 21, then all prime factors of 21 would also be prime factors of 75. However, 7 is a prime factor of 21 but not a prime factor of 75. Therefore, 75 is not divisible by 21. Example: Is 42 divisible by 12? Find the prime factorisations of both: 42=2x3x7and12=2x2x3 All prime factors of 12 are also prime factors of 42. But the prime factorisation of 12 is not included in the prime factorisation of 42. This is because 2 occurs twice in the prime factorisation of 12 but only once in the prime factorisation of 42. This means that 42 is not divisible by 12. We can say that if one number is divisible by another, then the prime factorisation of the second number is included in the prime factorisation of the first number. % Figure it Out 1.
