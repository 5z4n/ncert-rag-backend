using which both the treasures can be reached are the common factors of the two numbers where the treasures are placed. % What jump size can reach both 15 and 30?

The sum of my digits is 8. b. Iamanumber less than 100. Two of my factors are 3 and 5. One of my digits is 1 more than the other. A number for which the sum of all its factors is equal to twice the number is called a perfect number. The number 28 is a perfect number. Its factors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 and 28. Their sum is 56 which is twice 28. Find a perfect number between 1 and 10. Find the common factors of: a. 20 and 28 b. 35 and 50 c. 4,8 and 12 d. 5,15 and 25 Find any three numbers that are multiples of 25 but not multiples of 50. Anshu and his friends play the idli-vada game with two numbers, which are both smaller than 10. The first time anybody says idlivada is after the number 50. What could the two numbers be which are assigned idli and vada ? In the treasure hunting game, Grumpy has kept treasures on 28 and 70. What jump sizes will land on both the numbers? In the diagram below, Guna has erased all the numbers except ! ml the common multiples. Find out what those numbers could be and fill in the missing numbers in the empty regions.

Guna wants to put 12 figs in each box and Anshu wants to put 7 figs in each box. How many arrangements are possible? Think and find out the different ways how 1. Guna can arrange 12 figs in a rectangular manner. 2. Anshu can arrange 7 figs in a rectangular manner. Guna has listed out these possibilities. Observe the number of rows and columnsineach ofthe arrangements. How are they related to 12? In the second arrangement, for example, 12 figs are arranged in
