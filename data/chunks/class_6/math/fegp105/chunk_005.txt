following numbers are prime: 23, 51, 37, 26? Write three pairs of prime numbers less than 20 whose sum is a multiple of 5. The numbers 13 and 31 are prime numbers. Both these numbers have same digits 1 and 3. Find such pairs of prime numbers up to 100. Find seven consecutive composite numbers between 1 and 100. Twin primes are pairs of primes having a difference of 2. For example, 3 and 5 are twin primes. So are 17 and 19. Find the other twin primes between 1 and 100. Prime Time 9. Identify whether each statement is true or false. Explain. a. There is no prime number whose units digit is 4. b. A product of primes can also be prime. c. Prime numbers do not have any factors. d. Alleven numbers are composite numbers. e. 2 is a prime and so is the next number, 3. For every other prime, the next number is composite. 10. Which of the following numbers is the product of exactly three distinct prime numbers: 45, 60, 91, 105, 330? 11. How many three-digit prime numbers can you make using each of 2, 4 and 5 once? 12. Observe that 3 is a prime number, and 2 x 3+1=7isalsoa prime. Are there other primes for which doubling and adding 1 gives another prime? Find at least five such examples. 5.3 Co-prime Numbers for Safekeeping Treasures Which pairs are safe? Let us go back to the treasure finding game. This time, treasures are kept on two numbers. Jumpy gets the treasures only if he is able to reach both the numbers with the same jump size. There is also a new rule a jump size of 1 is not allowed. % Where should Grumpy place the treasures so that Jumpy cannot reach both the treasures? Will placing the treasure on 12 and 26 work? No! If the jump size is chosen to be 2, then Jumpy will reach both 12 and 26. What about 4 and 9? Jumpy cannot reach both using any jump size other than 1. So, Grumpy knows that the pair 4 and 9 is safe. Check if these pairs are safe: a. 15 and 39 b.4 and 15 c. 18 and 29 d. 20 and 55 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 What is special about safe pairs? They don t have any common factor other than 1. Two numbers are said to be co-prime to each other if they have no common factor other than 1. Example: As 15 and 39 have 3 as a common factor, they are not co-prime. But 4 and 9 are co-prime. % Which of the following pairs of numbers are co-prime? a. 18 and 35 b. 15 and 37 c. 30 and 415 d. 17 and 69 e. 81 and 18 % While playing the idli-vada game with different number ! pairs, Anshu observed something interesting! 1. Sometimes the first common multiple was the same Talk as the product of the two
