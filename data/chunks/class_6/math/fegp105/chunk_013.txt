572, 980, 1111, 2345 5. The teacher asked if 14560 is divisible by all of 2, 4, 5, 8 and 10. Guna checked for divisibility of 14560 by only two of these numbers and then declared that it was also divisible by all of them. What could those two numbers be? 6. Which of the following numbers are divisible by all of 2, 4, 5, 8 and 10: 572, 2352, 5600, 6000, 77622160. 7. Write two numbers whose product is 10000. The two numbers should not have 0 as the units digit. 5.6 Fun with Numbers Special numbers There are four numbers in this box. Which number looks special to you? Why do you say so? Look at the what Guna s classmates have to share: e Karnawati says, 9 is special because it is a single-digit number whereas all the other numbers are 2-digit numbers . e Gurupreet says, 9 is special because it is the only number that is a multiple of 3 . e Murugan says, 16 is special because it is the only even number and also the only multiple of 4 . e Gopika says, 25 is special as it is the only multiple of 5 . e Yadnyikee says, 43 is special because it is the only prime number . e Radha says, 43 is special because it is the only number that is not a square . Prime Time Within each box try to say how each number is special compared to the rest. Share with your classmates and find out who else gave the same reasons as you did. Did anyone ! give different reasons that may not have occurred to you?! % Below are some boxes with four numbers in each box. (nai a Talk A prime puzzle The figure on the left shows the puzzle. The figure on the right | __.@ shows the solution of the puzzle. Think what the rules can be to Ci solve the puzzle. 7 Rules Fill the grid with prime numbers only so that the product of each row is the number to the right of the row and the product of each column is the number below the column. Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 sh = Ifanumber is divisible by another, the second number is called a factor of the first. For example, 4 is a factor of 12 because 12 is divisible by 4 (12 +4=3). = Prime numbers are numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ... that have only two factors, namely 1 and themselves. = Composite numbers are numbers like 4, 6, 8, 9, ... that have more than 2 factors, i.e., at least one factor other than 1 and themselves. For example, 8 has the factor 4 and 9 has the factor 3, so 8 and 9 are both composite. = Every number greater than 1 can be written as a product of prime numbers. This is called the number s prime factorisation. For example, 84=2x2x3x7. = There
