units digit is 4. b. A product of primes can also be prime. c. Prime numbers do not have any factors. d. All even numbers are composite numbers. e. 2 is a prime and so is the next number, 3. For every other prime, the next number is composite. Ans. a. True, unit digit 4 means even number. We know that 2 is the only even prime number. b. False, product of primes becomes a composite number. c. False, prime numbers have exactly two factors: 1 and the number itself. d. False, all even numbers except 2 are composite numbers e. True, as every pair, other than (2, 3), contains an even number which is a composite number. Q.10. Which of the following numbers is the product of exactly three distinct prime numbers: 45, 60, 91, 105, 330? Ans. 105=3 x5 x 7 is the only number which is the product of three distinct prime numbers. Q.11. How many three-digit prime numbers can you make using each of 2, 4 and 5 once? Ans. None Q.12. Observe that 3 is a prime number, and 2 x 3 + 1 =7 is also a prime. Are there other primes for which doubling and adding 1 gives another prime? Find at least five such examples. Ans. Yes, 11=2x5+1, 47=2x23+1, 83=2x41+1 23 = 2 x 11 +1, 59=2 x 29+1 (Try other possibilities.) Section 5.3 Page No. 115 :O Where should Grumpy place the treasures so that Jumpy cannot reach both the treasures? Check if these pairs are safe: a. 15 and 39 b. 4 and 15 c. 18 and 29 d. 20 and 55 Ans. Safe pairs are: 4 and 15, 18 and 29. Page no. 116 :O Q. Which of the following pairs of numbers are co-prime? a. 18 and 35 b. 15 and 37 c. 30 and 415 d. 17 and 69 e. 81 and 18 Ans. The pairs of co-prime numbers are: a. 18 and 35 b. 15 and 37 d. 17 and 69 -O Q. While playing the idli-vada game with different number pairs, Anshu observed something interesting! 1. Sometimes the first common multiple was the same as the product of the two numbers. 2. At other times the first common multiple was less than the product of the two numbers. Find examples for each of the above. How is it related to the number pair being coprime? Ans. 1. Examples when the first common multiple is the product of the two numbers: 3,5; 3,7 and 4,9. 2. Examples when the first common multiple is less than the product of the two numbers: 3,6; 3,12 and 6, 15 Whenever the number pair is co-prime the first common multiple is the product of the two numbers.
