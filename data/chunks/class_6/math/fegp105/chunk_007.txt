say that there may be more ways to factorise these numbers. But if we take any of the given factorisations, for example, 80 = 16 x 5 and 63 = 9 x 7, then there are no common factors. Can we conclude that 80 and 63 are co-prime? As Anshu s mistake above shows, we cannot conclude that as there may be other ways to factorise the numbers. What this means is that we need a more systematic approach to check if two numbers are co-prime. Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 Prime factorisation Take a number such as 56. It is composite, as we saw that it can be written as 56 = 4x 14.So, both 4 and 14 are factors of 56. Now take one of these, say 14. It is also composite and can be written as 14 = 2 x 7. Therefore, 56 = 4 x 2 x 7. Now, 4 is composite and can be written as 4=2.x 2. Therefore, 56 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 7. All the factors appearing here, 2 and 7, are prime numbers. So, we cannot divide them further. In conclusion, we have written 56 as a product of prime numbers. This is called prime factorisation of 56. The individual factors are called prime factors. For example, the prime factors of 56 are 2 and 7. Every number greater than 1 has a prime factorisation. The idea is the same: keep breaking the composite numbers into factors till only primes are left. The number 1 does not have any prime factorisation. It is not divisible by any prime number. What is the prime factorisation of a prime number like 7? It is just 7 (we cannot break it down any further). Let us see a few more examples. By going through different ways of breaking down the number, we wrote 63 as 3 x 3 x 7 and as 3 x 7 x 3. Are they different? Not really! The same prime numbers 3 and 7 occur in both cases. Further, 3 appears two times in both and 7 appears once. Here, you see four different ways to get prime factorisation of 36. Observe that in all four nen get two 2s and Multiply back to see that you get 36 in all four cases. For any number, itis aremarkable fact that there is only one prime factorisation, except that the prime factors may come in different Prime Time orders. As we explain below, the order is not important. However, as we Saw in these examples, there are many ways to arrive at the prime factorisation! Does the order matter? Using this diagram, can you explain why 30 = 2 x 3 x 5, no matter which way you multiply 2, 3, and 5? When multiplying numbers, we can do so in any order. The end result is the same. That is why, when two 2s and two 3s are multiplied in any order, we get 36. In a
