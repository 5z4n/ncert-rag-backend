12 figs in each box and Anshu wants to put 7 figs in each box. How many arrangements are possible? Think and find out the different ways how 1. Guna can arrange 12 figs in a rectangular manner. 2. Anshu can arrange 7 figs in a rectangular manner. Guna has listed out these possibilities. Observe the number of rows and columnsineach ofthe arrangements. How are they related to 12? In the second arrangement, for example, 12 figs are arranged in two columns of 6 each or 12 = 2 x 6. Anshu could make only one arrangement: 7 x 1 or 1 x 7. There are no other rectangular arrangements possible. In each of Guna s arrangements, multiplying the number of rows by the number of columns gives the [TELL] number 12. So, the number of rows or columns are factors of 12. We saw that the number 12 can be arranged in a rectangle in more than one way as 12 has more than two factors. The number 7 can be arranged in only one way, as it has only two factors 1 and 7. Numbers that have only two factors are called prime numbers or primes. Here are the first few primes 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19. Notice that the factors of a prime number are 1 and the number itself. What about numbers that have more than two factors? They are called composite numbers. The first few composite numbers are 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20. Prime Time What about 1, which has only one factor? The number 1 is neither a prime nor a composite number. % How many prime numbers are there from 21 to 30? How many composite numbers are there from 21 to 30? Can we list all the prime numbers from 1 to 100? Here is an interesting way to find prime numbers. Just follow the steps given below and see what happens. Step 1: Cross out 1 because it is neither prime nor composite. Step 2: Circle 2, and th outall multiples of 2 after that, A@@ORIOPs pa . ., 4, 6, 8, so on.
