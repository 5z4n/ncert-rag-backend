answers. [9] Page 49 Section 2.10 Figure it Out Q.1. In Fig. 2.23, list all the angles possible. Did you find them all? Now, guess the measures of all the angles. Then, measure the angles with a protractor. Record all your numbers in a table. See how close your guesses are to the actual measures. Ans. ZCAP, ZACD, ZAPL, ZDLP, ZRPL, ZSLP, ZPRS, ZLSR, ZBRS, ZCLP Try more! Page 52 Section 2.11 Figure it Out Q.2. Use a protractor to find the measure of each angle. Then classify each angle as acute, obtuse, right or reflex. Ans. ZPTR = 30 (Acute angle) ZPTQ = 60 (Acute angle) ZPTW = 102 (Obtuse angle) ZWTP = 258 (Reflex angle) ao op Let s Explore: Q. In this figure, ZTER = 80 . What is the measure of ZBET? What is the measure of ZSET? Ans. ZBET= 100 , ZSET = 10 Page 53 Figure it out Q.3. Make any figure with three acute angles, one right angle and two obtuse angles. Ans. ZA, ZB & ZC are three acute angles ZD, ZF are obtuse angle ZE is right angle [10] Q.4. Draw the letter M such that the angles on the sides are 40 each and the angle in the middle is 60 . Ans. 40 40 Q.5. Draw the letter Y such that the three angles formed are 150 , 60 and 150 . Ans. 150 150 Q.6. The Ashoka Chakra has 24 spokes. What is the degree measure of the angle between two spokes next to each other? What is the largest acute angle formed between two spokes? Ans. The angle between two spokes next to each other is 15 . Largest acute angle between spokes is 75 . Q.7. Puzzle: I am an acute angle. If you double my measure, you get an acute angle. If you triple my measure, you will get an acute angle again. If you quadruple (four times) my measure, you will get an acute angle yet again! But if you multiply my measure by 5, you will get an obtuse angle measure. What are the possibilities for my measure? Ans. The acute angle can be 19 , 20 , 21 & 22 . [11]
