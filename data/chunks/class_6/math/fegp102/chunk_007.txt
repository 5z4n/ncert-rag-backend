To get a right angle at A, we need to draw a line through it that divides the straight angle CAB into two equal parts. eo e ee @ Lines and Angles 4. Geta slanting crease on the paper. Now, try to get another crease that is perpendicular to the slanting crease. a. How many right angles do you have now? Justify why the angles are exact right angles. b. Describe how you folded the paper so that any other person who doesn t know the process can simply follow your description to get the right angle. Classifying Angles Angles are classified in three groups as shown below. Right angles are shown in the second group. What could be the common feature of the other two groups? In the first group, all angles are less than a right angle or in other words, less than a quarter turn. Such angles are called acute angles. In the third group, all angles are greater than a right angle but less than a straight angle. The turning is more than a quarter turn and less than a half turn. Such angles are called obtuse angles. % Figure it Out 1. Identify acute, right, obtuse and straight angles in the previous figures. 2. Make a few acute angles and a few obtuse angles. Draw them in different orientations. Ganita Prakash | Grade
