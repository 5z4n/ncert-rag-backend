measures 180 , a right angle measures 90 . 180 units 90 units O B O B A pinch of history A full turn has been divided into 360 . Why 360? The reason why we use 360 today is not fully known. The division of a circle into Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 360 parts goes back to ancient times. The Rigveda, one of the very oldest texts of humanity going back thousands of years, speaks of a wheel with 360 spokes (Verse 1.164.48). Many ancient calendars, also going back over 3000 years such as calendars of India, Persia, Babylonia and Egypt were based on having 360 days in a year. In addition, Babylonian mathematicians frequently used divisions of 60 and 360 due to their use of sexagesimal numbers and counting by 60s. Perhaps the most important and practical answer for why mathematicians over the years have liked and continued to use 360 degrees is that 360 is the smallest number that can be evenly divided by all numbers up to 10, aside from 7. Thus, one can break up the circle into 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 equal parts, and still have a whole number of degrees in each part! Note that 360 is also evenly divisible by 12, the number of months in a year, and by 24, the number of hours in a day. These facts all make the number 360 very useful. %& The circle has been divided into 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8,9 10 and 12 parts below. What are the degree measures of the resulting angles? Write the degree measures down near the indicated angles. ID GD OOS) 2S IS AS Degree measures of different angles How can we measure other angles in degrees? It is for this purpose that we have a tool called a protractor that is either a circle divided into 360 equal parts as shown in Fig. 2.12 (on page 32), or a half circle divided into 180 equal parts. Unlabelled protractor Lines and Angles Here is a protractor. Do you see the straight angle at the center divided into 180 units of 1 degree? Only part of the lines dividing the straight angle are visible, though! Starting from the marking on the rightmost point of the base, there is a long mark for every 10 . From every such long mark, there is a medium sized mark after 5 . %f Figure it out Ml ty n, My YW My 1. Write the measures of the following angles: a. Z KAL Notice that the vertex of this angle coincides with the centre of the protractor. So the number of units of 1 degree angle between KA and AL gives the measure of ZKAL. By counting, we get ZKAL = 30 Making use of the medium sized and large sized marks, is it possible to count the number of units in 5s or 10s? b. ZWAL c. ZTAK Ganita Prakash | Grade
