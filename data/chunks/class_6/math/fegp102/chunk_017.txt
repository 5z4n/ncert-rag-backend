measured in degrees. One full rotation or turn is considered as 360 degrees and denoted as 360 . = Degree measures of angles can be measured using a protractor. = Angles can be straight (180 ), right (90 ), acute (more than 0 and less than 90 ), obtuse (more than 90 and less than 180 ), and reflex (more than 180 and less than 360 ). CHAPTER 2 SOLUTIONS Lines and Angles Section 2.4 Page No. 15 Figure it Out Q.1. Rihan marked a point on a piece of Sheetal marked two points on a piece paper. How many lines can he draw of paper. How many different lines that pass through the point? can she draw that pass through both of the points? Can you help Rihan and Sheetal find their answers? Ans. Rihan can draw many/uncountable number of lines through the given point. Sheetal can draw only one line through the two given points. Q.2. Name the line segments in Fig. 2.4. Which of the five marked points are on exactly one of the line segments? Which are on two of the line segments? Ans. LM, MP, PQ, QR Points L and R are exactly on one line segment. Points M, P and Q are on two line segments. Q.3. Name the rays shown in Fig. 2.5. Is T the starting point of each of these rays? ee Ans. TA, TB, TN and NB >S lS > No, T is the starting point of TB, TN and TA but not of NB. Q.4. Draw a rough figure and write labels appropriately to illustrate each of the following: a. OP and OQ meet at O. b. XY and PQ intersect at point M. c. Line / contains points E and F but not point D. d. Point P lies on AB. Ans. [1] (c) (d) * D Q.5. In Fig. 2.6, name: a. Five points b. A line c. Four rays d. Five line segments Ans. a) D,E, O, B and C Do Tec ol Sl i b) DE or DO or DB or EO or EB or OB > a => => c) OC, OB, OE, OD (Try for other rays) d) DE, DO, B, EO, EB (OB; OC are also possible) Q.6. Here is a ray OA (Fig. 2.7). It starts at O and passes through the point A. It also passes through the point B. a. Can you also name it as OB? Why? b. Can we write OA as AO? Why or why not? Ans. a) Yes, O is the starting point and point B lies on the rays that goes endlessly in the . . > . . > direction of A. OA is the extension of OB. b) No, OA is a ray with starting point O whereas AO is a ray with starting point A. [2] Section 2.5 Page 19 Figure it Out Q.1. Can you find the angles in the given pictures? Draw the rays forming any one of the
