protractor to draw angles having the following degree measures: a. 110 b. 40 c. 75 d. 112 e. 134 3. Draw an angle whose degree measure is the same as the angle given below: Also, write down the steps you followed to draw the angle. 2.11 Types of Angles and their Measures We have read about different types of angles in this chapter. We have seen that a straight angle is 180 and a right angle is 90 . How can other types of angles acute and obtuse be described in terms of their degree measures? Acute Angle: Angles that are smaller than the right angle, ie., less than 90 and are greater than 0 , are called acute angles. T R 50 Q S 40 Q R E Pp E Examples of acute angles Lines and Angles Obtuse Angle: Angles that are greater than the right angle and less than the straight angle, 1.e., greater than 90 and less than 180 , are called obtuse angles. X I S S T W Examples of obtuse angles Have we covered all the possible measures that an angle can take? Here is another type of angle. Reflex angle: Angles that are greater than the straight angle and less than the whole angle, Le., greater than 180 and less than 360 , are called reflex angles. Examples of reflex angles %& Figure it Out 1. In each of the below grids, join A to other grid points in the figure by a straight line to get: a.

ZWTP OF Let's Explore In this figure, ZTER = 80 . What is the measure of BET? What is the measure of SET? Lines and Angles Hint: Observe that ZREB is a straight angle. Hence, the degree measure of ZREB = 180 of which 80 is covered by ZTER. A similar argument can be applied to find the measure of SET. %& Figure it Out 1.
