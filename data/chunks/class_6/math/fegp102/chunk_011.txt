180 units 3. Fold the semi-circular sheet in half as shown in Fig. 2.15 to form a quarter circle. The measure of a quarter circle is j of a full turn. The measure of t turn = j of 360 = Or, the measure ofa : turn = 7 of a half turn = 5 of 180 = Thus, mark 90 at the top of the semicircle. Fig. 2.15 Lines and Angles 4. Fold the sheet again as shown in Figs. 2.16 and 2.17: Fig. 2.16 Fig. 2.17 When folded, this is 7 of the circle, or Z of a turn, or 7 of 360 , or Z of 180 or Z of 90 = . The new creases formed give us measures of 45 and 180 45 = 135 as shown. Write 45 and 135 at the correct places on the new creases along the edge of the semicircle. 5. Continuing with another half fold as shown in Fig. 2.18, we get an angle of measure Fig. 2.18 6. Unfold and mark the creases as OB, OC, ..., etc., as shown in Fig.2.19 and Fig. 2.20. Fig. 2.19 Fig. 2.20 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 % Think! In Fig. 2.19, we have ZAOB = ZBOC = ZCOD = ZDOE = ZEOF = ZFOG = ZGOH = ZHOI= . Why? Angle Bisector At each step, we folded in halves. This process of getting half of a given angle is called bisecting the angle. The line that bisects a given angle is called the angle bisector of the angle. Identify the angle bisectors in your handmade protractor. Try to make different angles using the concept of angle bisector through paper folding. %& Figure it Out 1. Find the degree measures of the following angles using your protractor. I J G K 2. Find the degree measures of different angles in your classroom using your protractor. ! It is important that students make their own protractor and use it to ' measure different angles before using the standard protractor so that ' they know the concept behind the marking of the standard protractor. | bee ee eee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee eee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee et Lines and Angles i i i i i i i ee a ee a 4 a ee A a a a aa 3.
