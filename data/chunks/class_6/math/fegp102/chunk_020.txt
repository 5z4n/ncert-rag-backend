larger openings. Q.4. Find out the number of acute angles in each of the figures below. What will be the next figure and how many acute angles will it have? Do you notice any pattern in the numbers? Ans. (i) three (11) Twelve (111) Twenty-one The next figure will have thirty acute angles. Yes, the pattern is3 x 04+1,3*14+1,3x2+1,3x3+1,... The number 0,1,2,3,4,..... are number of inner triangles. [6] Section 2.9 Page No. 35 Figure it out Q.1. Write the measures of the following angles: a. Z KAL b. ZWAL ce. ZTAK Ans. a. ZKAL =30 Yes, it is possible to count the number of units in 5s or 10s. b. ZWAL = 50 c. ZTAK = 120 Page No. 36 Q. Name the different angles in the figure and write their measures. Ans. ZPOQ=35 ZPOR = 95 ZPOS = 125 ZPOT = 160 ZQOR = 60 ZQOS = 90 ZQOT = 125 ZQOU = 145 ZROS = 30 ZROT = 65 ZROU = 85 ZSOT = 35 ZSOU = 55 ZTOU = 20 [7] Page No. 40 Think! Q. In Fig. 2.20, we have ZAOB = ZBOC = ZCOD = ZDOE = ZEOF = ZFOG = ZGOH = ZHOI=____. Why? Ans. Each of the angles = 22.5 As the straight angle of 180 is divided into eight equal parts so each of the right angles will be of measure = =22.5 Figure it Out Q.1. Find the degree measures of the following angles using your protractor. Ans. ZIHJ = ZJHI=47 ZGHK = ZIHJ = 23 ZIHJ = ZJHI = 108 Q.3. Find the degree measures for the angles given below. Check if your paper protractor can be used here! Ans. ZIHJ=42 , zIHJ=116 No, paper protractor cannot work here. Q.4. How can you find the degree measure of the angle given below using a protractor? Ans. Measure of marked angle = 360 Measure of unmarked angle = 360 - 100 = 260 Try other ways to find the marked angle Q.5. Measure and write the degree measures for each of the following angles: Ans. 120 130 60 monogep Q.6. Find the degree measures of ZBXE, ZCXE, ZAXB and ZBXC. Ans. ZBXE = 115 , ZCXE = 85 , ZAXB = 65 ZBXC = 30 Q.7. Find the degree measures of ZPQR, ZPQS and ZPQT. Ans. ZPQR =45 ZPQS=100 ZPQT=150 . [8] Page 45 Figure it Out Q.1. Angles in a clock: a. The hands of a clock make different angles at different times. At 1 o clock, the angle between the hands is 30 . Why? b. What will be the angle at 2 o clock? And at 4 o clock? 6 o clock? c. Explore other angles made by the hands of a clock. Ans. (a) The angles at the centre of the clock is 360 which is divided into 12 equal parts. So. . 360 The angle between two successive numbers = > 30 (b) At 2 O clock = 60 = 2x30 At 4 0 clock =
