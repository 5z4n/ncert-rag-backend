Is there any similarity or difference between the two? Using 9 unit squares (having an area of 9 sq units), we have made figures with two different perimeters the first figure has a perimeter of 12 units and the second has a perimeter of 20 units. Arrange or draw different figures with 9 sq units to get other perimeters. Each square should align with at least one other square on at least one side completely and together all squares should form a single connected figure with no holes. %o& Using 9 unit squares, solve the following. 1. What is the smallest perimeter possible? 2. What is the largest perimeter possible? 3. 4. Can you make other shaped figures for each of the above three Make a figure with a perimeter of 18 units. perimeters, or is there only one shape with that perimeter? What is your reasoning? % Let s do something tricky now! We have a figure below having perimeter 24 units. Without calculating all over again, out what will be the change in the perimeter if a new square is attached as shown on the right. observe, think and_ find Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 6_Perimeter and Area.indd 145 13-08-2024 16:16:33 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 Experiment placing this new square at different places and think what the change in perimeter will be. Can you place the square so that the perimeter: a) increases; b) decreases; c) stays the same? %F Below is the house plan of Charan. It is in a rectangular plot. Look at the plan. What do you notice?
