total length of the boundaries of each shape then usea scale or measuring tape to measure and verify the perimeter for each shape. % Akshi says that the perimeter of this triangle shape is 9 units. Toshi says it can t be 9 units and the perimeter will be more than 9 units. What do you think? eo. 0, it will be more than 9 units. The perimeter is 9 units. e e Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 6_Perimeter and Area.indd 134 13-08-2024 16:16:31 Perimeter and Area This figure has lines of two different unit lengths. Measure the lengths of a red line and a blue line; are they same? We will call the red lines straight lines and the blue lines diagonal lines. So, the perimeter of this triangle is 6 straight units + 3 diagonal units. We can write this in a short form as: 6s + 3d units. %e Write the perimeters of the figures below in terms of straight and diagonal units. Perimeter of a regular polygon Like squares, closed figures that have all sides and all angles equal are called regular polygons. We studied the sequence of regular polygons as Shape Sequence #1 in Chapter 1. Examples of regular polygons are the equilateral triangle (where all three sides and all three angles are equal), regular pentagon (where all five sides and all five angles are equal), etc. Perimeter of an equilateral triangle We know that for any triangle its perimeter A is sum of all three sides. Using this understanding, we can find the perimeter of an equilateral triangle. Perimeter of an equilateral triangle = AB + BC + AC = AB + AB+ AB = 3 times length of one side. Perimeter of an equilateral triangle = 3 x length of a side. B C What is a similarity between a square and an equilateral triangle?

Also, generalise your understanding for the perimeter of other regular polygons. Discuss more about regular polygons and encourage students to come up with a general formula for the perimeter of a regular polygon.
