The perimeter of a rectangle is twice the sum of its length and width. b. The perimeter of a square is four times the length of any one of its sides. m The area of a closed figure is the measure of the region enclosed by the figure. m Area is generally measured in square units. m Thearea ofa rectangle is its length times its width. The area of asquare is the length of any one of its sides multiplied by itself. m Two closed figures can have the same area with different perimeters, or the same perimeter with different areas. m Areas of regions can be estimated (or even determined exactly) by breaking up such regions into unit squares, or into more generalshaped rectangles and triangles whose areas can be calculated. CHAPTER 6 SOLUTIONS Perimeter and Area Section 6.1 Page no. 132 -O Figure it Out Q.1. Find the missing terms: a. Perimeter of a rectangle = 14 cm; breadth = 2 cm; length = ? b. Perimeter of a square = 20 cm; side of a length = ? c. Perimeter of a rectangle = 12 m; length = 3 m; breadth = ? Ans. (a) length=5 cm (b) length of a side = 5 cm (c) breadth = 3cm Q.2. A rectangle having side lengths 5 cm and 3 cm is made using a piece of wire. If the wire is straightened and then bent to form a square, what will be the length of a side of the square? Ans. Length of a side of square = 4 cm Q.3. Find the length of the third side of a triangle having a perimeter of 55 cm and having two sides of length 20 cm and 14 cm, respectively? Ans. Length of the third side of triangle = 21 cm Q.4. What would be the cost of fencing a rectangular park whose length is 150 m and breadth is 120 m, if the fence costs Rs.40 per metre? Ans. P=2 x (150+120) = 540; So, 540 x 40 = Rs. 21,600 Q.5. A piece of string is 36 cm long. What will be the length of each side, if it is used to form: a. A square, b. A triangle with all sides of equal length, and c. A hexagon (a six sided closed figure) with sides of equal length? Ans. (a) Length of each side of square = 9 cm (b) Length of each side of regular triangle = 12 cm (c) Length of each side
