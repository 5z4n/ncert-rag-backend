Let us recall some key points. The amount of region enclosed by a closed figure is called its area. In previous grades, we arrived at the formula for the area of a rectangle and a square using square grid paper. Do you remember? Area of a square = Area of arectangle = __ Help students in recalling the method of finding the area of a | rectangle and a square using grid papers. Provide square grid ! papers to students and let them come up with the formula. ee = ee ee Se ee Let s see some real-life problems related to these ideas. Example: A floor is 5 m long and 4 m wide. A square carpet of sides 3 m is laid on the floor. Find the area of the floor that is not carpeted. Solution Length of the floor = 5 m. Width of the floor = 4m. Area of the floor = length x width = 5 mx 4m=20 sqm. Length of the square carpet = 3 m. Area of the carpet = length x length = 3m x 3 m=9sqm. Hence, the area of the floor laid with carpet is 9 sq m. Therefore, the area of the floor that is not carpeted is: area of the floor minus the area of the floor laid with carpet = 20 sg m-9sqm=11sqm. Example: Four square flower beds each of side 4 m are in four corners ona piece of land 12 m long and 10 m wide. Find the area of the remaining part of the land.

Area of the whole land = 1x w=12 mx 10m=120 sqm. The sidelength of each of the four square flower beds is (s) = 4m. Area of one flower bed =sxs=4mx4m=16sqm. Hence, the area of the four flower beds = 4 x 16 sq m = 64 sq m. Therefore, the area ofthe remaining part of the land is: area of the complete land minus the area of all four flower beds = 120 sq m - 64 sq m = 56 sq m. % Figure it Out 1.
