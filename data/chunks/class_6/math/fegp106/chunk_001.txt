Perimeter of a triangle Consider a triangle having three given sides of ot , lengths 4 cm, 5 cm and 7 cm. Find its perimeter. Ka Perimeter of the triangle = 4cm+5cm+7cm = 16cm. 7em Perimeter of a triangle = sum of the lengths of its three sides. Example: Akshi wants to put lace all around a rectangular tablecloth that is 3 m long and 2 m wide. Find the length of the lace required. Solution Length of the rectangular table cover = 3 m. Breadth of the rectangular table cover = 2 m. Akshi wants to put lace all around the tablecloth. Therefore, the length of the lace required will be the perimeter of the rectangular tablecloth. Now, the perimeter of the rectangular tablecloth = 2 x (length + breadth) =2x(3m+2m) =2x5m=10m. Hence, the length of the lace required is 10 m. Example: Find the distance travelled by Usha if she takes three rounds of a square park of side 75 m. Solution Perimeter of the square park = 4 x length of a side = 4 75 m = 300 m. Distance covered by Usha in one round = 300 m. Therefore, the total distance travelled by Usha in three rounds = 3 x 300 m = 900 m.

A rectangle having sidelengths 5 cm and 3 cm is made using a piece of wire. If the wire is straightened and then bent to form a square, what will be the length of a side of the square? Find the length of the third side of a triangle having a perimeter of 55 cm and having two sides of length 20 cm and 14 cm, respectively. What would be the cost of fencing a rectangular park whose length is 150 m and breadth is 120 m, if the fence costs 40 per metre? A piece of string is 36 cm long. What will be the length of each side, if it is used to form: a. Asquare, b. A triangle with all sides of equal length, and c. A hexagon (a six sided closed figure) with sides of equal length? A farmer has a rectangular field having length 230 m and breadth 160 m. He wants to fence it with 3 rounds of rope as shown. What is the total length of rope needed? Perimeter and Area Matha Pachchi! Starting Point Starting Point for Toshi for Akshi Eachtrackis a rectangle. Akshi s track has length 70 mand breadth 40 m. Running one complete round on this track would cover 220 m, l.e., 2 x (70 + 40) m =
