the complete land minus the area of all four flower beds = 120 sq m - 64 sq m = 56 sq m. % Figure it Out 1. Chapter 6 Perimeter and Area.indd 138 The area of a rectangular garden 25 m long is 300 sq m. What is the width of the garden? What is the cost of tiling a rectangular plot of land 500 m long and 200 m wide at the rate of 8 per hundred sq m? A rectangular coconut grove is 100 m long and 50 m wide. If each coconut tree requires 25 sq m, what is the maximum number of trees that can be planted in this grove? By splitting the following figures into rectangles, find their areas (all measures are given in metres).

Explore and figure out how many pieces have the same area. 2. How many times bigger is Shape D as compared to Shape C? What is the relationship between Shapes C, D and E? 3. Which shape has more area: Shape D or F? Give reasons for your answer. 4. Which shape has more area: Shape F or G? Give reasons for your answer. 5. What is the area of Shape A as compared to Shape G? Is it twice as big? Four times as big? Hint: In the tangram pieces, by placing the shapes over each other, we can find out that Shapes A and B have the same area, Shapes C and E have the same area. You would have also figured out that Shape D can be exactly covered using Shapes C and E, which means Shape D has twice the area of Shape C or shape E, etc. 6. Can you now figure out the area of the big square formed with all seven pieces in terms of the area of Shape C? 7. Arrange these 7 pieces to form a rectangle. What will be the area of this rectangle in terms of the area of Shape C now? Give reasons for your answer. 8. Are the perimeters of the square and the rectangle formed from these 7 pieces different or the same? Give an explanation for your answer.

We can estimate the area of any simple closed shape by using a sheet of squared paper or graph paper where every square measures 1 unit x 1 unit or 1 square unit. To estimate the area, we can trace the shape onto a piece of transparent paper and place the same on a piece of squared or graph paper and then follow the below conventions 1. The area of one full small square of the squared or graph paper
