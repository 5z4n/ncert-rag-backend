for laying down a lawn? Ans. Available area for lawn = 172 sq. m. Q.5. Shape A has an area of 18 square units and Shape B has an area of 20 square units. Shape A has a longer perimeter than Shape B. Draw two such shapes satisfying the given conditions. Ans. Possible dimensions of shape A are 6m and 3m; 2m and 9m; 18m and 1m Corresponding Perimeters =18 m, 22m, 38m respectively Possible dimensions of shape B are 5m and 4m; 10m and 2m; 20m and Im Corresponding Perimeters =18m, 24m, 42m respectively Given P(A) > P(B) We may take P(A) = 22m or 38m and P(B) = 18 m and draw the figures accordingly. Q.7. Draw a rectangle of size 12 units x 8 units. Draw another rectangle inside it, without touching the outer rectangle that occupies exactly half the area. Ans. Area of outer rectangle = 96 sq. units. Area of inner rectangle = 48 sq. units. Draw the rectangles accordingly. Q.8. A square piece of paper is folded in half.
