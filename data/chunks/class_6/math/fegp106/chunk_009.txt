Give the dimensions of a rectangle whose area is the sum of the areas of these two rectangles having measurements: 5 m x 10 m and2m*x 7m. The area of a rectangular garden that is 50 m long is 1000 sq m. Find the width of the garden. The floor of a room is 5 m long and 4 m wide. A square carpet whose sides are 3 m in length is laid on the floor. Find the area that is not carpeted.

Shape A has an area of 18 square units and Shape B has an area of 20 square units. Shape A has a longer perimeter than Shape B. Draw two such shapes satisfying the given conditions. On a page in your book, draw a rectangular border that is 1 cm from the top and bottom and 1.5 cm from the left and right sides. What is the perimeter of the border? Draw a rectangle of size 12 units x 8 units. Draw another rectangle inside it, without touching the outer rectangle that occupies exactly half the area. A square piece of paper is folded in half.

Thearea ofeach rectangle is larger than the area of the square. b. The perimeter of the square is greater than the perimeters of both the rectangles added together. c. The perimeters of both the rectangles added together is always 15 times the perimeter of the square. d. The area of the square is always three times as large as the areas of both rectangles added together.
