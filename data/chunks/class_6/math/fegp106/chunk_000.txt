The perimeter of any closed plane figure is the distance covered along its boundary when you go around it once. For a polygon, i.e., a closed plane figure made up of line segments, the perimeter is simply the sum of the lengths of its all sides, i.e., the total distance along its outer boundary. The perimeter of a polygon = the sum of the lengths of its all sides. Let us revise the formulas for the perimeter of rectangles, squares, and triangles. Perimeter of a rectangle Consider a rectangle ABCD whose length and breadth are 12 cm and 8 cm, respectively. What is its perimeter? Perimeter of the rectangle = Sum of the lengths of its four sides =AB+BC+CD+DA A 12 cm B 8cm Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 6_Perimeter and Area.indd 129 13-08-2024 16:16:29 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 =AB+BC+AB+BC Opposite sides of a = 2x AB +2 * BC rectangle are always = 2 x (AB + BC) equal. So, AB = CD and = 2x (12 cm +8 cm) AD = BC = 2 x (20 cm) = 40 cm. From this example, we see that Perimeter of a rectangle = length + breadth + length + breadth. Perimeter of a rectangle = 2 x (length + breadth). The perimeter of a rectangle is twice the sum of its length and breadth. im Perimeter of a square Debojeet wants to put coloured tape all around a square photo frame of side 1m as shown. What will be the length of the coloured tape he requires? Since Debojeet wants to put the coloured tape all around the square photo frame, he needs to find the perimeter of the photo frame. Thus, the length of the tape required = perimeter of the square = sum of the lengths of all four sides of the square =1m+1m+1im+im=4m. Now, we know that all four sides of a square are equal in length. Therefore, in place of adding the lengths of each side, we can simply multiply the length of one side by 4. Thus, the length of the tape required = 4x 1m=4m. From this example, we see that Perimeter of a square = 4 x length of a side. The perimeter of a square is quadruple the length of its side.

Find its perimeter. Ka Perimeter of the triangle = 4cm+5cm+7cm = 16cm. 7em Perimeter of a triangle = sum of the lengths of its three sides. Example: Akshi wants to put lace all around a rectangular tablecloth that is 3 m long and 2 m wide. Find the length of the lace required. Solution Length of the rectangular
