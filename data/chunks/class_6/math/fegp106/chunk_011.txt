From point A to flag: 100 + 100 + 100 + 50 100m = 350m From point B to flag: 125 + 150 + 75 = 350m = Common Finishing Line Section 6.1 Page no. 134 :O Q. Akshi says that the perimeter of this triangle shape is 9 units. Toshi says it can t be 9 units and the perimeter will be more than 9 units. What do you think? Ans. The perimeter will be more than 9 units as the length of a diagonal of a square is always greater than the sides of the square. [2] P.135 -O Q.
