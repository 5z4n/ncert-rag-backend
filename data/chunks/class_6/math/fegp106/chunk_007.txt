area, is it possible to predict the shape of the rectangle with the greatest perimeter as well as the least perimeter? Give examples and reasons for your answer. 6.3 Area of a Triangle Draw a rectangle on a piece of paper and draw one of its diagonals. Cut the rectangle along that diagonal and get two triangles. % Check! whether the two triangles overlap each other exactly. Do they have the same area? Try this with more rectangles having different dimensions. You can check this for a square as well. % Can you draw any inferences from this exercise? Please write it here. Now, see the figures below. Is the area of the blue rectangle more or less than the area of the yellow triangle? Or is it the same? Why? % Can you see some relationship between the blue rectangle and the yellow triangle and their areas? Write the relationship here. r----@-Hnr-------- 1 Teacher s Note +---------------> Help students in articulating their inferences and in defining the relationships they have observed in their own words, gradually leading to a common statement for whole classroom. Recall the definition of a diagonal in the classroom. ee | Draw suitable triangles on grid paper to verify your inferences and relationships observed in the above exercises.

E C grades to calculate the area of any closed figure using grid paper and 1. Find the area of blue triangle BAD. 2. Find the area of red triangle ABE. Both the red and blue triangles have the same area but they look very different. Area of rectangle ABCD=_ So, the area of triangle BAD is half of the area of the rectangle ABCD. What about There are triangle two halves of ABE? two different rectangles. Area of triangle ABE = Area of triangle AEF + Area of triangle BEF. Here, the area of triangle AEF = half of the area of rectangle AFED. Similarly, the area of triangle BEF = half of the area of rectangle BFEC. Thus, the area of triangle ABE = half of the area of rectangle AFED +half of the area of rectangle BFEC Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 6_Perimeter and Area.indd 143 13-08-2024 16:16:33 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 = half of the sum of the areas of the rectangles AFED and BFEC = half of the area of rectangle ABCD.
