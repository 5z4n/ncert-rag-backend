length? A farmer has a rectangular field having length 230 m and breadth 160 m. He wants to fence it with 3 rounds of rope as shown. What is the total length of rope needed? Perimeter and Area Matha Pachchi! Starting Point Starting Point for Toshi for Akshi Eachtrackis a rectangle. Akshi s track has length 70 mand breadth 40 m. Running one complete round on this track would cover 220 m, l.e., 2 x (70 + 40) m = 220 m. This is the distance covered by Akshi in one round. %f Figure it Out 1. Find out the total distance Akshi has covered in 5 rounds. 2. Find out the total distance Toshi has covered in 7 rounds. Who ran a longer distance? 3. Think and mark the positions as directed a. b. c. Chapter 6_Perimeter and Area.indd 133 Mark A at the point where Akshi will be after she ran 250 m. Mark B at the point where Akshi will be after she ran 500 m. Now, Akshi ran 1000 m. How many full rounds has she finished running around her track? Mark her position as C . Mark X at the point where Toshi will be after she ran 250 m. Mark Y at the point where Toshi will be after she ran 500 m.

Mark her position as 2 . % Deep Dive: In races, usually there is a common finish line for all the runners. Here are two square running tracks with the inner track of 100 m each side and outer track of 150 m each side. The common finishing line for both runners is shown by the flags in the figure which are in the center of one of the sides of the tracks. 100 m If the total race is of 350 m, then we have to find out where the starting positions of the two runners should be on these two tracks so =) that they both have a common finishing line after they run for 350 m. Mark the starting points of the runner on the inner track as A and the runner on the outer track as B . Common Finishing Line % Estimate and Verify Take a rough sheet of paper or a sheet of newspaper. Make a few random shapes by cutting the paper in different ways. Estimate the total length of the boundaries of each shape then usea scale or measuring tape to measure and verify the perimeter for each shape. % Akshi says that the perimeter of this triangle shape is 9 units. Toshi says it can t be 9 units and the perimeter will be more than 9 units. What do you think? eo. 0, it will be more than 9 units. The perimeter is 9 units. e e Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 6_Perimeter and Area.indd 134
