AX? Ans. 2 cm. AX = 4 cm. Q.2. Take a central line of a different length and try to draw the wave on it. Ans. central line Q.3. Try to recreate the figure where the waves are smaller than a half circle (as appearing in the neck of the figure A Person ). The challenge here is to get both the waves to be identical. This may be tricky! Ans. Tw Page no. 193 Section 8.2 -O Q. Which of the following is not a name for this square? 1. PQSR 2. SPQR [1] 3. RSPQ 4. QRSP Ans. PQSR is not a name for the given square. Page no. 194 Section 8.2 Figure it out Draw a rectangle & then leave one dot distance diagonally to place the four smaller squares. Q.2. Identify if there are any squares in this collection. Use measurements if needed. Ans. A is a square. :O Think: Is it possible to reason out if the sides are equal or not, and if the angles are right or not without using any measuring instruments in the above figure? Can we do this by only looking at the position of corners in the dot grid? Ans. Yes, In the above figure without measuring one can reason out for equal sides & right angles. Yes, the position of the points on the grid paper makes it possible Q.3. Draw at least 3 rotated squares and rectangles on a dot grid. Draw them such that their corners are on the dots. Verify if the squares and rectangles that you have drawn satisfy their respective properties. Ans. [2] Page no. 197 Section 8.3 O Construct Q.1. Draw a rectangle with sides of length 4 cm and 6 cm. After drawing, check if it satisfies both the rectangle properties. Ans. ZA = ZB = ZC = ZD = 90 AB=CD=4cm & AD=BC=6cm. 6cm | Q.2. Draw a rectangle of sides 2 cm and 10 cm. After drawing, check if it satisfies both the rectangle properties. A4cm >B Ans. S R ZP = ZQ= ZR= ZS = 90 PQ=SR= 10cm & PS = QR=2 cm Q.3. Is it possible to construct a 4-sided figure in which all the angles are equal to 90 but * opposite sides are not equal? Ans. No. Page no. 198 Section 8.4 -O Q. Is there a shorthand way of writing it down? In all the sentences, only the position of X, Y and the length XY changes. So we could write this as: Distance of X from A Distance of Y from B Length of XY Ans. Distance of X from A Distance of Y from B Length of XY 5 mm 3 cm 7.4cm lcm lcm 7cm 2cm 4cm 7.3 cm [3] Page No. 199 -O Q. Have you checked what happens to the length XY when X and Y are placed at the same distance away from A and B, respectively? For example, as in the cases like these: Distance of X
