of X and Y to check if there are other positions where they are at their nearest or farthest. You could construct multiple copies of the rectangle and try out various positions of X and Y. How will you keep track of the lengths XY for different positions of X and Y? Here is one way of doing it. Suppose here are some of the positions of X and Y that you have considered: e When X is 5 mm away from A and Y is 3 cm away from B, XY=__ cm__mm e When X is 1 cm away from A and Y is 1 cm away from B, XY=_ _ cm__mm e When X is 2 cm away from A and Y is 4 cm away from B, XY =___ cm __ mmandso on. % Is there a shorthand way of writing it down? In all the sentences, only the position of X, Y and the length XY changes. So we could write this as: Playing with Constructions %ef Have you checked what happens to the length XY when X and Y are placed at the same distance away from A and B, respectively? For example, as in the cases like these: 5mm 5mm 1cm 1cm 1cm5 mm 1cm5 mm and so on. % In each of these cases, observe 1. how the length XY compares to that of AB and 2. the shape of the 4-sided figure ABYX. %e How does the farthest distance between X and Y compare with the length of AC? BD? tee Construct Breaking Rectangles Construct a rectangle that can be divided into 3 identical squares as shown in the figure. Solution If this seem difficult, let us simplify the problem. we Explore What about constructing a rectangle that can be divided into two identical squares? Can you try it? It is wise to first plan and then construct. But how do we plan? Can you think of a way?

A B C What can we infer from this figure? Can you identify the equal sides? Since, the two squares are identical, AB = BC and FE = ED Since ABEF and BCDE are squares, all the sides in each of the squares are equal. This is written as AF = AB = BE = FE BE = BC = CD = ED So, all the shorter lines are equal! A convention is followed to represent equal sides. It is done by putting a | on the line. Refer to the rough figure. Using this analysis, can you try constructing it? Remember, all that was asked for is a rectangle that can be divided into two identical squares
