Symmetry Let us explore more figures. % Can you draw a figure with radial arms that has a) exactly 5 angles of symmetry, b) 6 angles of symmetry? Also find the angles of symmetry in each case. Hint: Use 5 radial arms for the first case. What should the angle between two adjacent radial arms be? %& Consider a figure with radial arms having exactly 7 angles of symmetry. What will be its smallest angle of symmetry? Is the number of degrees a whole number in this case? If not, express it as a mixed fraction. Let us find the angles of symmetry for other kinds of figures. % Figure it Out 1. Find the angles of symmetry for the given figures about the point marked e. (a) (b) (c) 2. Which of the following figures have more than one angle of symmetry? Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 3. Give the order of rotational symmetry for each figure: Let us list down the angles of symmetry for all the cases above. Angles of symmetry when there are exactly 2 of them: 180 , 360 . Angles of symmetry when there are exactly 3 of them: 120 , 240 , 360 . e Angles of symmetry when there are exactly 4 of them: 90 , 180 , 270 , 360 . Do youobserve something common about the angles ofsymmetries in these cases? The first set of numbers are all multiples of 180. The second are all multiples of 120. The third are all multiples of 90. %& In each case, the angles are the multiples of the smallest angle. You may wonder and ask if this will always happen. What do you think? % True or False Every figure will have 360 degrees as an angle of symmetry.

Is there a smallest angle of symmetry for all figures? It turns out that this is the case for most figures, except for the most symmetric shapes like the circle, whose symmetries we now discuss. Symmetries of a circle The circle is a fascinating figure. What happens when you rotate a circle clockwise about its centre? It coincides with itself. It does not matter what angle you rotate it by! So, for a circle, every angle is an angle of symmetry. MB eS Now take a point on the rim of the circle and join it to the centre. Extend the segment to a diameter of the circle. Is that diameter a line
