other kinds of figures. Ans. 360 -=7= 51= No, its smallest angle of symmetry is not a whole number. Page no. 235 Figure it out Q1. Find the angles of symmetry for the given figures about the point marked. Ans. a. Angles of symmetry = 90 , 180 , 270 , 360 b. Angle of symmetry = 360 c. Angles of symmetry = 180 , 360 Q2. Which of the following figures have more than one angle of symmetry? Ans. The following figures have more than one angle of symmetry [10] Q3. Give the order of rotational symmetry for each figure: Ans. Orders of rotational symmetry (a) x< (c) order of orderofsymmetry=2 _orderofsymmetry=4 _ order of symmetry=6__ order of symmetry= 4 order of symmetry= 6 ae order of symmetry= 3 order of symmetry= 4 order of symmetry=5 Page no. 236 Os In each case, the angles are the multiples of the smallest angle. You may wonder and ask if this will always happen. What do you think? Ans. Yes, the angles of symmetry are always the multiples of the smallest angle. For example, the second angle is twice the amount of rotation of the first rotation. -O True or False Every figure will have 360 degrees as an angle of symmetry. e If the smallest angle of symmetry of a figure is a natural number in degrees, then it is a factor of 360. Ans. True True [11] Section 9.2 Page no. 238 Figure it out Q1.
