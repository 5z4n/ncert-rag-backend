A quadrilateral with reflection symmetry but not having rotational symmetry Q4. In a figure, 60 is the smallest angle of symmetry. What are the other angles of symmetry of the figure? Ans. Other angles of symmetry = 120 , 180 , 240 , 300 , 360 . Q5. In the figure, 60 in an angle of symmetry. The figure has two angles of symmetry less then 60 . What is its smallest angle of symmetry? Ans. The smallest angle of symmetry = 20 Q6. Can we have a figure with rotational symmetry whose smallest angle of symmetry is a. 45 ? b. 17 ? Ans. a. yes, as 360 is a multiple of 45 . b. No, as 360 is not a multiple of 17 . Q7. This is a picture of the new Parliament Building in Delhi. a. Does the outer boundary of the picture have reflection symmetry? If so, draw the lines of symmetries. How many are they? b. Does it have rotational symmetry around its centre? If so, find the angles of rotational symmetry. Ans. a. Yes, the outer boundary of the picture has 3 lines of symmetry. b. Yes, the outer boundary has rotational symmetry. The angles of rotational symmetry are 120 , 240 , 360 . [14] Q8.
