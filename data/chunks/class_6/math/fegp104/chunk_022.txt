Project Tiger was launched in 1973 to track and protect tigers in India. Starting in 2006, the exact number of tigers in India was tracked. Shagufta and Divya looked up information about the number of tigers in India between 2006 and 2022 in 4-year intervals. They prepared a frequency table for this data and a bar graph to present this data, but there are a few mistakes in the graph. Can you find those mistakes and fix them? Ans. There are mistakes in the bars of 2006, 2010, 2014, 2018. Section 4.5 Page no. 103 Figure it out Q.1. If you wanted to visually represent the data of the heights of the tallest persons in each class in your school, would you use a graph with vertical bars or horizontal bars? Why? Ans. To present the data of the heights of the tallest persons in each class in a school, vertical bar graph is useful as heights of persons can be compared by heights of bars easily. (Although both bar graphs can be used.) (Think of more reasons!) Q.2. If you were making a table of the longest rivers on each continent and their lengths, would you prefer to use a bar graph with vertical bars or with horizontal bars? Why? Try finding out this information, and then make the corresponding table and bar graph! Which continents have the longest rivers? Ans. In this case, bar graph with horizontal bars is useful as length of a river is a horizontal feature, so lengths of rivers can be compared with lengths of horizontal bars easily. (Although both bar graphs can be used.) (can you think of any other reasons?)
