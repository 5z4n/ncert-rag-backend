A bar graph with vertical bars is also called a column graph. Columns are the pillars you find in a building that hold up the roof. Below is a column graph for our table of tallest mountains. From this column graph, it becomes easier to compare and visualise the heights of the mountains. 10000 aa" 8000 6000 4000 ~ 2000 1000 a Fs EF SS SS SS Sy Ks Se ots Bh Ss" ph pts SS S RS we yr 9 Re Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd 102 13/08/2024 15:33:28 Data Handling and Presentation Se a a i i a a ee ~~ a ee a a a a a A a ee a a a a a a a aa In general, it is more intuitive, suggestive and visually appealing to represent heights, that are measured upwards from the ground, using bar graphs that have vertical bars or columns. Similarly, lengths that are parallel to the ground (for example, distances between location on Earth) are usually best represented using bar graphs with horizontal arcs. % Figure it Out 1. If you wanted to visually represent the data of the heights of the tallest persons in each class in your school, would you use a graph with vertical bars or horizontal bars? Why? 2. Ifyou were making a table of the longest rivers on each continent and their lengths, would you prefer to use a bar graph with vertical bars or with horizontal bars? Why? Try finding out this information, and then make the corresponding table and bar graph! Which continents have the longest rivers? Infographics When data visualisations such as bar graphs are further beautified with more extensive artistic and visual imagery, they are called information graphics or infographics for short. The aim of infographics is to make use of attention-attracting and engaging visuals to communicate information even more clearly and quickly, in a visually pleasing way. As an example of how infographics can be used to communicate data even more suggestively, let us go back to the table above listing the tallest mountain on each continent. We drew a bar graph with vertical bars (columns) rather than horizontal bars, to be more indicative of mountains. But instead of rectangles, we could use triangles, which look a bit more like mountains. And, we can add a splash of colour as well. Here is the result.
