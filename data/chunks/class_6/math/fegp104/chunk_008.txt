Rasgulla 7 their frequencies; and on the vertical line we will write the frequencies representing the number of students. 2. We must choose a scale. That means we must decide how many students will be represented by a unit length of a bar so that it fits nicely on our paper. Here, we will take 1 unit length to represent 1 student. 3. For jalebi, we therefore need to draw a bar having a height of 6 units (which is the frequency of the sweet jalebi), and similarly for the other sweets we have to draw bars as high as their frequencies.

We, therefore, get a bar graph as shown below Sweet preferences of students 13 E 11 3 4 B 2 | So | 5 | 2 5 Se 5 4 | Z 4 | 3 | 1 | 0 SY Jalebi Gulabjamun Gujia Barfi Rasgulla Sweets When the frequencies are larger and we cannot use the scale of 1 unit length = 1 number (frequency), we need to choose a different scale like we did in the case of pictographs. Example: The number of runs scored by Smriti in each of the 8 matches are given in the table below: Match |} Match | Match | Match | Match | Match | Match | Match | Match 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 80 50 10 100 90 0 90 50 Runs In this example, the minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 100. Using a scale of 1 unit length = 1 run would mean that we have to go all the way from 0 to 100 runs in steps of 1. This would be unnecessarily tedious. Instead, let us use a scale where 1 unit length = 10 runs. We mark this scale on the vertical line and draw the bars according to the scores in each match. We get the following bar graph representing the above data. Data Handling and Presentation e~ ~e_eoowaoaeaerene.
