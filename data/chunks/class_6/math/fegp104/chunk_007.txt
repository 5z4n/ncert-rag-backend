time, only about 150 vehicles passed through the crossing. The second smallest bar is that for the time interval 11 a.m. 12 noon, when about 600 vehicles passed through the crossing. The total number of cars passing through the crossing during the two-hour interval 8.00-10.00 a.m. as shown by the bar graph is about 1000 + 800 = 1800 vehicles.

How many total cars passed through the crossing between 6 a.m. and noon? 2. Why do you think so little traffic occurred during the hour of 6-7 a.m., as compared to the other hours from 7 a.m. noon? 3. Why do you think the traffic was the heaviest between 7-8 a.m.? 4. Why do you think the traffic was lesser and lesser each hour after 8 a.m. all the way until noon?

The numbers are expressed in crores. If you were to take 1 unit length to represent one person, drawing the bars will Data Handling and Presentation be difficult! Therefore, we choose the scale so that 1 unit represents 10 crores. The bar graph for this choice is shown in the figure. So a bar of length 5 units represents 50 crores and of 8 units represents 80 crores. e On the basis of this bar graph, what may be a few questions you may ask your friends? How much did the population of India increase over 50 years? How much did the population increase in each decade? 4.4 Drawing a Bar Graph In a previous example, Shri Nilesh prepared a frequency table representing the sweet preferences of the students in his class. Let s try to prepare a bar graph to present his data 1. First, we draw a horizontal | veal I No. of Students line and a vertical line. On the horizontal line, we will Jalebi 6 write the name of each of Gulab jamun 9 the sweets, equally spaced, Gujiya 13 from which the bars will Barfi 3 rise in accordance with Rasgulla 7 their frequencies; and on the vertical line we will write the frequencies representing the number of students. 2. We must choose a scale. That means we must decide how many students will be represented by a unit length of a bar so that it fits nicely on our paper. Here, we will take 1 unit length to represent 1 student. 3. For jalebi, we therefore need to draw a bar having a height of 6 units (which is
