students in their classroom and then collect the data for it, | It can be a fun activity in which they also learn about their classmates, ' Discuss how they can organise the data in different ways, each way ' having its own advantages and limitations. For all these tasks and the tasks under Figure it Out , discuss the tasks with the children and let them understand the tasks, and then let them plan and present their research processes and conclusions in the class. 4.2 Pictographs Pictographs are one visual and suggestive way to represent data without writing any numbers. Look at this picture you may be familiar with it from previous classes.

Based on this picture, answer the following questions: Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 4_ Data Handling and Presentation.indd 79 13/08/2024 15:33:12 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 e Which mode of travel is used by the most number of students? e Which mode of travel is used by the least number of students? A pictograph represents data through pictures of objects. It helps answer questions about data with just a quick glance. In the above pictograph, one unit or symbol ( ) is used to represent one student. There are also other pictographs where one unit or symbol stands for many people or objects. 4 Example: Nand Kishor collected responses from the children of his middle school in Berasia regarding how often they slept at least 9 hours during the night. He prepared a pictograph from the data: Number of Children ( = 10 Children) Always A A y A Sometimes A A A Never A A A A Answer the following questions using the pictograph: 1. What is the number of children who always slept at least 9 hours at night? How many children sometimes slept at least 9 hours at night? 3. How many children always slept less than 9 hours each night? Explain how you got your answer. Solutions 1. Inthe table, there are 5 pictures A for Always . Each picture represents 10 children. Therefore, 5 pictures indicate 5 x 10 = 50 children. 2. There are 2 complete pictures A (2 x 10 = 20) and a half picture y (half of 10 = 5). Therefore, the number of children who sleep at least 9 hours only sometimes is 20 + 5 = 25.

Hence, 4 x 10 = 40 children never sleep at least 9 hours in a night, i.e., they always sleep less than 9 hours.
