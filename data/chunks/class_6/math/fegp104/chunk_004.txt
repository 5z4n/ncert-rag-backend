Hence, 4 x 10 = 40 children never sleep at least 9 hours in a night, i.e., they always sleep less than 9 hours. Drawing a Pictograph One day, Lakhanpal collected data on how many students were absent in each class: Class I II Ill IV V VI Vil VIII {Os 3 5 4 2 0 1 5 C7 students f> He created a pictograph to present this data and decided to show 1 student as in the pictograph = 1 student Classes No. of students absent Meanwhile, his friends Jarina and Sangita collected data on how many students were present in each class: Clas I mm Iv Vv VI Vi VI iN No. ofS 30 35 20 25 30 25 30 20 students Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 4 If they want to show their data through a pictograph, where they also use one symbol for each student, as Lakhanpal did, what are the challenges they might face? Jarina made a plan to address this since there were many students, she decided to use to represent 5 students. She figured that would save time and space too. VIII vil VI Classes < '|\O OOOOO No. of students present Sangita decided to use one to represent 10 students instead. Since she used one to show 10 students, she had a problem in showing 25 students and 35 students in the pictograph. Then, she realised she could use to show 5 students. = 10 students Vu Vil VI Classes < IV Tl II No. of students present Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd 82 13/08/2024 15:33:12 Data Handling and Presentation %e What could be the problems faced in preparing sucha ! ae pictograph, if the total number of students present in a class is 33 or 27? e Pictographs are a nice visual and suggestive way to represent data. They represent data through pictures of objects. e Pictographs can help answer questions and make inferences about data with just a quick glance (in the examples above about favourite games, favourite colours, most common modes of conveyance, number of students absent, etc.). e By reading a pictograph, we can quickly understand the frequencies of the different categories (for example, cricket, hockey, etc.) and the comparisons of these frequencies. e In a pictograph, the categories can be arranged horizontlly or vertically. For each category, simple pictures and symbols are then drawn in the designated columns or rows according to the frequency of that category. A scale or key (for example, : 1 student or : 5 students) is added to show what each symbol or picture represents. Each symbol or picture can represent one unit or multiple units. e It can be more challenging to prepare a pictograph when the amount of data is large or when the frequencies
