a primary school decided to plant tree saplings in the school campus and in the surrounding village during the first week of July. Details of the saplings they planted are as follows 11. Number of saplings planted 60 40 20 0 Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday Day The total number of saplings planted on Wednesday and Thursday is The total number of saplings planted during the whole week The greatest number of saplings were planted on and the least number of saplings were plantedon_ Why do you think that is the case? Why were more saplings planted on certain days of the week and less on others? Can you think of possible explanations or reasons? How could you try and figure out whether your explanations are correct? The number of tigers in India went down drastically between 1900 and 1970. Project Tiger was launched in 1973 to track and protect the tigers in India. Starting in 2006, the exact number of tigers in India was tracked. Shagufta and Divya looked up information about the number of tigers in India between 2006 and 2022 in fouryear intervals. They prepared a frequency table for this data anda bar graph to present this data, but there are a few mistakes in the graph. Can you find those mistakes and fix them?

They represent data through equally-spaced bars, each of equal width, where the lengths or heights give frequencies of the different categories. Each category is represented by a bar where the length or height depicts the corresponding frequency (for example, cost) or quantity (for example, runs). * The bars have uniform spaces between them to indicate that they are free standing and represent equal categories. The bars help in interpreting data much faster than a frequency table. By reading a bar graph, we can compare frequencies of different categories at a glance. * We must decide the scale (for example, 1 unit length = 1 student or 1 unit length = = 200) for a bar graph on the basis of the data including the minimum and maximum frequencies, so that the resulting bar graph fits nicely and looks visually appealing on the paper or poster we are preparing. The markings of the unit lengths as per the scale must start from zero. a a 1 Teacher s Note :------------------; The main focus of this chapter is to learn how to handle data to find answers to specific questions or inquiries, to test hypotheses or to take specific decisions. This should be kept in mind when providing practice opportunities to collect, organise and analyse data. ee | Reprint 2025-26
