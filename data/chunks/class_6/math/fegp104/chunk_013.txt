visually appealing on the paper or poster we are preparing. The markings of the unit lengths as per the scale must start from zero. a a 1 Teacher s Note :------------------; The main focus of this chapter is to learn how to handle data to find answers to specific questions or inquiries, to test hypotheses or to take specific decisions. This should be kept in mind when providing practice opportunities to collect, organise and analyse data. ee | Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd 100 13/08/2024 15:33:28 Data Handling and Presentation 4.5 Artistic and Aesthetic Considerations In addition to the steps described in previous sections, there are also some other more artistic and aesthetic aspects one can consider when preparing visual presentations of data to make them more interesting and effective. First, when making a visual presentation of data such as a pictograph or bar graph, it is important to make it fit in the intended space; this can be controlled, for example, by choosing the scale appropriately, as we have seen earlier. It is also desirable to make the data presentation visually appealing and easy-to-understand, so that the intended audience appreciates the information being conveyed. Let us consider an example. Here is a table naming the tallest mountain on each continent, along with the height of each mountain in meters. : 7 South North : 7 : cman i America | America Africa |Europe}Antarctica| Australia Tallest Kiliman- Vinson . ._ Everest Aconcagua Denali { Elbrus . Koscuiszko Mountain jaro Massif Height 8848m 6962m 6194m 5895m 5642m 4892m 2228m How much taller is Mount Everest than Mount Koscuiszko? Are Mount Denali and Mount Kilimanjaro very different in height? This is not so easy to quickly discern from a large table of numbers. As we have seen earlier, we can convert the table of numbers into a bar graph, as shown on the right. Here, each value is drawn as a horizontal box. These are longer or shorter depending on the number they represent. This makes it easier to compare the heights of all these mountains at a glance.

A bar graph with vertical bars is also called a column graph. Columns are the pillars you find in a building that hold up the roof. Below is a column graph for our table of
