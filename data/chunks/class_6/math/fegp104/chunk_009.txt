Mistelfaneous 1200 To represent this data in the form of a bar graph, here are the steps e Draw two perpendicular lines, one horizontal and one vertical. e Along the horizontal line, mark the items with equal spacing between them and mark the corresponding expenditures along the vertical line. Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 e Take bars of the same width, keeping a uniform gap between them. e Choose a suitable scale along the vertical line. Let, 1 unit length = = 200, and then mark and write the corresponding values ( 200, = 400, etc.) representing each unit length. Finally, calculate the heights of the bars for various items as shown below House rent 3000 + 200 15 units Food 3400 + 200 17 units > Education 800 + 200 4 uni Electricity 400 = 200 2 g Transport 600 + 3 units G Miscellaneous 1 200 = 20( WG units Here is the bar graph that we obtain based on the above steps: 3400 3000 2600 2200 1800 1400 1000 600 200 Expenditure (in %) Food Electricity Transport House rent Miscellaneous Sc & iI o oO ro} jan Item Data Handling and Presentation %ef Use the bar graph to answer the following questions: 1.

Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 No. of Tickets Vidisha Jabalpur Seoni Indore Sagar City a. Write the number of tickets sold for Vidisha above the bar. b. Write the number of tickets sold for Jabalpur above the bar. The bar for Vidisha is 6 unit lengths and the bar for Jabalpur is 5 unit lengths. What is the scale for this graph? d. Draw the correct bar for Sagar. Add the scale of the bar graph by placing the correct numbers on the vertical axis. f. Are the bars for Seoni and Indore correct in this graph? If not, draw the correct bar(s). 3. Chinu listed the various means of transport that passed across the road in front of his house from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m.: bike cars ike bus bike bike bike auto
