Let s see if we can place some numbers in their appropriate positions on the number line. Here are the numbers: 2180, 2754, 1500, 3600, 9950, 9590, 1050, 3050, 5030, 5300 and 8400. ep} fp 1000 2000 \3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 10,000 % Figure it Out Identify the numbers marked on the number lines below, and label the remaining positions. a <f} _} } ff 4 +} + + + 2010 2020 6 ff 9996 9997 c.f ff} ff 4 4 15,077 15,078 15,083 a <-} } $+ +++ + + 4 86,705 87,705 Put a circle around the smallest number and a box around the largest number in each of the sequences above. Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 3.4 Playing with Digits We start writing numbers from 1, 2, 3 ... and so on. There are nine 1-digit numbers. % Find out how many numbers have two digits, three digits, four digits, and five digits. Digit sums of numbers Komal observes that when she adds up digits of certain numbers the sum is the same. For example, adding the digits of the number 68 will be same as adding the digits of 176 or 545. % Figure it Out 1. Digit sum 14 _g@ a. Write other numbers whose digits add up to 14. Math b. What is the smallest number whose digit sum is 14? c. What is the largest 5-digit whose digit sum is 14? ! d. How big a number can you form having the digitsum _! of 14? Can you make an even bigger number? ; 2. Find out the digit sums of all the numbers from 40 to 70. Share your observations with the class. 3. Calculate the digit sums of 3-digit numbers whose digits are consecutive (for example, 345). Do you see a pattern? Will this pattern continue? Number Play Digit Detectives After writing numbers from 1 to 100, Dinesh wondered how many times he 5] would have written the digit 7 ! <37 el] %ef Among the numbers 1-100, how 704! 1799 many times will the digit 7 ? occur? 616 Among the numbers 1-1000, how many times will the digit 7 occur? 3.5 Pretty Palindromic Patterns What pattern do you see in these numbers: 66, 848, 575, 797, 1111? These numbers read the same from left to right and from right to left. Try and see. Such numbers are called palindromes or palindromic numbers. All palindromes using 1, 2, 3 The numbers 121, 313,
