The numbers in the middle can be used as many times as needed to get the desired sum. Draw arrows from the middle to the numbers on the sides to obtain the desired sums. Two examples are given. It is simpler to do it mentally! 38,800 = 25,000 + 400 x 2 + 13,000 3400 = 1500 + 1500 + 400 3,400 iN i Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 3_Number Play.indd 65 14-08-2024 14:43:45 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 #0 Can we make 1,000 using the numbers in the middle?
