1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 It will take 8 rounds to reach the Kaprekar constant. Page no. 66 Section 3.8 Q. Can we make 1,000 using the numbers in the middle? Why not? What about 14,000, 15,000 and 16,000? Yes, it is possible. Explore how. What thousands cannot be made? Ans. No; the only number which is smaller than 1000 is 400 and 1000 is not a multiple of 400. 14000 = 1500 x 8 + 400 x 5 = 12000 + 2000 = 14000 15000 = 13000 + 400 x 5 = 13000 + 2000 = 15000 16000 = 1500 x 8 + 400 x 10 = 12000 + 4000 = 16000 Only one thousand (1000) cannot be made. Figure it out Q.1. Write an example for each of the below scenarios whenever possible. Could you find examples for all the cases? If not, think and discuss what could be the reason. Make other such questions and challenge your classmates. Ans. e 5 digit +5 digit > 90,250 45,000 + 45,400 = 90,400 > 90,250 e 5 digit + 3 digit = 6 digit sum 99,999 + 999 = 100,998 e 4 digit + 4 digit = 6 digit sum Not possible as even the sum of the greatest 4 digit numbers will not give a six digit sum. (9999 + 9999 = 19,998) [9] e 5 digit+5 digit = 6 digit sum 60,000 + 40,000 = 1,00,000 e 5 digit + 5 digit = 18,500 Not possible as smallest 5-digit number is 10,000. If both the numbers are 10,000 then the sum is 20,000, which is more than 18,500. e 5 digit 5 digit < 56,503 80,000 50,000 < 56,503 < 56,503 e 5 digit 3 digit =4 digit difference 10,000 999 = 9001 e 5 digit 4 digit =4 digit difference 12,000 2,500 = 9,500 e 5 digit 5 digit =3 digit difference 50,999 50,000 = 999 e 5 digit 5 digit = 91,500 Not possible as the difference of the greatest and the smallest 5 digit numbers, the maximum difference, can be 99,999 10,000 = 89,999 Some examples of other such questions are1. 5 digit +5 digit = 7 digit sum 2. 4 digit + 4 digit = 2900 More such examples can be made. Q.2. Always, Sometimes, Never? Below are some statements. Think, explore and find out if each of the statement is Always true , Only sometimes true or Never true . Why do you think so? Write your reasoning; discuss this with the class. a. 5-digit number + 5-digit number gives a 5-digit number b. 4-digit number + 2-digit number gives a 4-digit number c. 4-digit number + 2-digit number gives a 6-digit number d. 5-digit number 5-digit number gives a 5-digit number e. 5-digit number 2-digit number gives a 3-digit number Ans. a. Only sometimes true. 20,000 + 80,000 = 1,00,000 not a 5 digit number b. Only sometimes true 9,999 + 99 = 10,098 not a 4 digit
