is the smallest number in our group? Who among us is the closest to 50,000? Estimate the number of holidays you get in a year including weekends, festivals and vacation. Then, try to get an exact number and see how close your estimate is. Estimate the number of liters a mug, a bucket and an overhead tank can hold. Write one 5-digit number and two 3-digit numbers such that their sum is 18,670. Choose a number between 210 and 390. Create a number pattern similar to those shown in Section 3.9 that will sum up to this number. Reprint 2025-26 14-08-2024 14:43:46 Number Play 8. Recall the sequence of Powers of 2 from Chapter 1, Table 1. Why is the Collatz conjecture correct for all the starting numbers in this sequence? 9. Check if the Collatz Conjecture holds for the starting number 100. 10. Starting with 0, players alternate adding numbers between 1 and 3. The first person to reach 22 wins. What is the winning strategy now? = Numbers can be used for many different purposes including, to convey information, make and discover patterns, estimate magnitudes, pose and solve puzzles, and play and win games. = Thinking about and formulating set procedures to use numbers for these purposes is a useful skill and capacity (called computational thinking ). = Many problems about numbers can be very easy to pose, but very difficult to solve. Indeed, numerous such problems are still unsolved (for example, Collatz s Conjecture). CHAPTER 3 SOLUTIONS Number Play Q. Think about various situations where we use numbers. List five different situations in which numbers are used. See what your classmates have listed, share, and discuss. Ans. Five different possible situations in which numbers are used Time Calendar Counting objects/Marks Measurement of height & weight . Money There could many more. WP YN> Section 3.1 Page No. 55 Q. What do you think these numbers mean? Ans. Refer page 56. :O Page No. 56 Q1. Can the children rearrange themselves so that the children standing at the ends say 69 ? Ans. No; There will be no one standing on the other side of the child standing at the end. Q2. Can we arrange the children in a line so that all would say only 0s? Ans. Yes; All the children in the line should be of same height. Q3. Can two children standing next to each other say the same number? Ans. Yes; Refer picture on page 55. Q4. There are 5 children in a group, all of different heights. Can they stand such that four of them say 1 and the last one says 0 ? Why or why not? Ans. Yes, they can, if they are standing in ascending order of height. [1] Q5. For this group of 5 children, is the sequence 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 possible? Ans. No; the tallest child at the end cannot say1. Q6. Is the sequence 0, 1, 2, 1, 0 possible? Why or why not? O)
