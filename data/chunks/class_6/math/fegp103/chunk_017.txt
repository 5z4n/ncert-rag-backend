Chapter 1, Table 1. Why is the Collatz conjecture correct for all the starting numbers in this sequence? Ans. when we divide 2 = 2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2 by 2 it become 2 and every time you divide by 2 the same will continue happening, until you are left with 2 which when divided by 2 will leave 1. Q.9. Check if the Collatz Conjecture holds for the starting number 100. Ans. 100, 50, 25, 76, 38, 19, 58, 29, 88, 44, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2,1. Q.10 Starting with 0, players alternate adding numbers between | and 3. The first person to reach 22 wins. What is the winning strategy now? Ans. Winning strategy is to be the first player. [13]
