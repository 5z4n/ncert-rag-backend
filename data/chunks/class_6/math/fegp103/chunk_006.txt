what could be the reason. Make other such questions and challenge your classmates. 2. Always, Sometimes, Never? Below are some statements. Think, explore and find out if each of the statement is Always true , Only sometimes true or Never true . Why do you think so? Write your reasoning and discuss this with the class. a. 5-digit number + 5-digit number gives a 5-digit number b. 4-digit number + 2-digit number gives a 4-digit number c. 4-digit number + 2-digit number gives a 6-digit number d. 5-digit number - 5-digit number gives a 5-digit number e. 5-digit number - 2-digit number gives a 3-digit number 3.9 Playing with Number Patterns Here are some numbers arranged in some patterns. Find out the sum of the numbers in each of the below figures. Should we add them one by one or can we use a quicker way? %e& Share and discuss in class the different methods each one of you used to solve these questions. * > BERG oo fe :-:[:-: ks: Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 een 20323032322] 32323032322] aoe ao almlalalalefefe) * 3.10An Unsolved Mystery theCollatz Conjecture! i A Look at the sequences below the same rule is applied in all the sequences: a. 12,6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2,1 b. 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 c. 21, 64, 32, 16, 8,4, 2,1 d. 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2,1 Do you see how these sequences were formed? Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 3_Number Play.indd 68 14-08-2024 14:43:46 Number Play The rule is: one starts with any number; if the number is even, take half of it; if the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1; repeat. Notice that all four sequences above eventually reached the number 1. In 1937, the German mathematician, Lothar Collatz conjectured that the sequence will always reach 1, regardless of the whole number you start with. Even today despite many mathematicians working on it it remains an unsolved problem as to whether Collatz s conjecture is true! Collatz s conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. %e Make some more Collatz sequences like those above, starting with your favourite whole numbers. Do you always reach 1? Do you believe the conjecture of Collatz that all such sequences will eventually reach 1? Why or why not? 3.11 Simple Estimation Oe At times, we may not know or need an exact count of things and an estimate is sufficient for the purpose at hand. For example, your school headmaster might know the exact number of students enrolled in your school, but you may only know an estimated count. How many students are in your school? About 150? 400? A thousand? Paromita s class section has 32 children. The other 2 sections of her class have 29 and 35 children. So, she estimated the number of children in her class to be about
