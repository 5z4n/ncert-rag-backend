this with the class. a. 5-digit number + 5-digit number gives a 5-digit number b. 4-digit number + 2-digit number gives a 4-digit number c. 4-digit number + 2-digit number gives a 6-digit number d. 5-digit number 5-digit number gives a 5-digit number e. 5-digit number 2-digit number gives a 3-digit number Ans. a. Only sometimes true. 20,000 + 80,000 = 1,00,000 not a 5 digit number b. Only sometimes true 9,999 + 99 = 10,098 not a 4 digit number c. Never true 9,999 + 99 = 10,098 On adding the greatest 4 digit and the greatest 2 digit numbers, we can reach only 5 digit number 10,098. So there is no possibility of getting a 6 digit number. d. Only sometimes true Ex. 12,000 10,000 = 2,000 5 digit 5 digit = 4 digit e. Never true Ex. 10,000 99 = 9901 [10] Even if the greatest 2 digit numbers is subtracted from the smallest 5 digit number, 4 digit number will be obtained. Page no. 69 Section 3.10 Os Q. Make some more Collatz sequences like those above, starting with your favourite whole numbers. Do you always reach 1? Do you believe the conjecture of Collatz that all such sequences will eventually reach 1? Why or why not? Ans. a) 28, 14, 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 b) 19, 58, 29, 88, 44, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 Yes we always reach 1. The even numbers are halved and when we have an odd number we convert it into an even number by multiplying by 3 and adding | so that eventually it can be halved again. The smallest even number is 2 so we will reach 1 for sure. Q.3. Name some objects around you that are: a. a few thousand in number b. more than ten thousand in number Ans. A few thousands: car numbers, 4 digit pin More than ten thousands: Salary, Mobile numbers. Q.3. Roshan wants to buy milk and 3 types of fruit to make fruit custard for 5 people. He estimates the cost to be = 100. Do you agree with him? Why or why not? Ans. Yes, it is possible with less quantity of serving and with purchase of 1-1-1 fruit of each type. However, it is not possible with costly fruits and more quantity of serving. Q.4. Estimate the distance between Gandhinagar (in Gujarat) to Kohima (in Nagaland). Ans. 2500 kilometer Q. 5. Sheetal is in Grade 6 and says she has spent around 13,000 hours in school till date. Do you agree with her? Why or why not? Ans. No, I do not agree with her. There are 6 school hours in a day and around 200 working days in a year. 13,000 6x200 (Nursery, KG, 1,2,3,4,5,6) 8 years She is in school for 8 years, 13,000 hours is way too high. = 10.8 years
