(More such questions can be made) [11] Section 3.12 Page No. 72 Figure it Out Q.1. There is only one supercell (number greater than all its neighbours) in this grid. If you exchange two digits of one of the numbers, there will be 4 supercells. Figure out which digits to swap. 16,200 39,344 29,765 23,609 45,306 19,381 50,319 38,408 Ans. If I exchange the digits 1 and 6 in the number 62,871 then there will be 4 Super cells. Q.2. How many rounds does your year of birth take to reach the Kaprekar constant? Ans. Suppose the birth year is 1980, then, 9810 8721 7443 9963 6642 7641 -1089 -1278 -3447 -3699 -2466 -1467 8721 7443 3996 6264 4176 6174 It takes 6 rounds. (Try now for your year of birth.) Q.3. We are the group of 5-digit numbers between 35,000 and 75,000 such that all of our digits are odd. Who is the largest number in our group? Who is the smallest number in our group? Who among us is the closest to 50,000? Ans. With repeating digit With non repeating digit Largest number > 73,999 73,951 Smallest number > 35,111 35,179 With repeating digit With non repeating digit Closest to 50000 51,111 51,379 Q.6. Write one 5-digit number and two 3-digit numbers such that their sum is 18,670. Ans. 18000 + 300 + 370 = 18670. Try for more. [12] Q.7. Choose a number between 210 and 390. Create a number pattern similar to those shown in Section 3.9 that will sum up to this number. Ans. Number Chosen: 250 25 25 50 50 50 25 25 Or 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 Q.8. Recall the sequence of Powers of 2 from Chapter 1, Table 1. Why is the Collatz conjecture correct for all the starting numbers in this sequence? Ans. when we divide 2 = 2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2 by 2 it become 2 and every time you divide by 2 the same will continue happening, until you are left with 2 which when divided by 2 will leave 1. Q.9. Check if the Collatz Conjecture holds for the starting number 100. Ans. 100, 50, 25, 76, 38, 19, 58, 29, 88, 44, 22,
