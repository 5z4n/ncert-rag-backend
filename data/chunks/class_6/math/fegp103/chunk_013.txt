for other 3-digit numbers. [7] Section 3.7 Page no. 64 Q. Try and find out all possible times on a 12-hour clock of each of these types. Ans. 4:44 2:22 3:33 10:10 11:11 12:12 09:09 12:21 05:50 10:01 Think of some more! Q. Find some other dates of this form from the past. Ans. 20/04/2004, 20/06/2006, Try for yourself! Q. Find all possible dates of this form from the past. Ans. 01/02/2001, 02/02/2002, Think of some more! Q. Will any year s calendar repeat again after some years? Will all dates and days in a year match exactly with that of another year? Ans. Yes, The calendar repeats itself after 6 years if only one leap year is included in these 6 years. If 2 leap years are included, then it will repeat after 5 years. Page no. 64 ee Figure it out Q.1. Pratibha uses the digits 4 , 7 , 3 and 2 , and makes the smallest and largest 4digit numbers with them: 2347 and 7432. The difference between these two numbers is 7432 2347 = 5085. The sum of these two numbers is 9779. Choose 4 digits to make: a. the difference between the largest and smallest numbers greater than 5085. b. the difference between the largest and smallest numbers less than 5085. c. the sum of the largest and smallest numbers greater than 9779. d. the sum of the largest and smallest numbers less than 9779. Ans. Some of the possibilities are a. 7431 1347 = 6084 b. 7433 3347 = 4086 c. 7433 + 3347 = 10780 d. 7431 + 1347 = 8778 Q.2. What is the sum of the smallest and largest 5-digit palindrome? What is their difference? Ans. Smallest 5 digit palindrome = 10001 largest 5 digit palindrome = 99999 Sum = 10001 + 99999 = 110,000 Difference = 99999 10001 = 89,998 [8] Q.3. The time now is 10:01. How many minutes until the clock shows the next palindromic time? What about the one after that? Ans. Time Now > 10:01 Next palindrome time > 11:11 After 1 hr. 10 min = 70 min the clock will show next palindrome time. Next palindrome time = 12:21 which will occur after 2 hr. 20 min = 140 min from 10:01. Q.4. How many rounds does the number 5683 take to reach the Kaprekar constant? Ans. 5683 8653 8550 9432 8730 6552 9963 6642 7641 3568 5058 = -23490 3078 = 2556 3699-2466 - 1467 5085 3492 7083 5652 3996 6264 4176 6174 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 It will take 8 rounds to reach the Kaprekar constant. Page no. 66 Section 3.8 Q. Can we make 1,000 using the numbers in the middle? Why not? What about 14,000, 15,000 and 16,000? Yes, it is possible. Explore how. What thousands cannot be made? Ans. No; the only number which is smaller than 1000 is 400 and 1000 is not a multiple of 400. 14000 = 1500 x 8 + 400
