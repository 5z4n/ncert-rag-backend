number from these digits. Call it A. Make the smallest number from these Use digits digits. Call it B. of C Subtract B from A. Call it C. C=A-B What happens if we continue doing this? A = 8632 A = 6642 A= 7641 A= B = 2368 B = 2466 B = 1467 B= C = 8632-2368 C = 6642-2466 C = 7641-1467 C= = 6264 = 4176 = 6174 %& Explore Take different 4-digit numbers and try carrying out these steps. Find out what happens. Check with your friends what they got. You will always reach the magic number 6174 ! The number 6174 is now called the Kaprekar constant . Carry out these same steps with a few 3-digit numbers. What number will start repeating? Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 3.7 Clock and Calendar Numbers On the usual 12-hour clock, there are timings with different patterns. For example, 4:44, 10:10, 12:21. %e& Try and find out all possible times on a 12-hour clock of each of these types. Manish has his birthday on 20/12/2012 where the digits 2 , 0 , 1 , and 2 repeat in that order. %e& Find some other dates of this form from the past.

Jeevan was looking at this year s calendar. He started wondering, Why should we change the calendar every year? Can we not reuse a calendar? . What do you think? You might have noticed that last year s calendar was different from this year s. Also, next year s calendar will also be different from the previous years. %& But, will any year s calendar repeat again after some / years? Will all dates and days in a year match exactly with ey that of another year? % Figure it Out 1. Pratibha uses the digits 4 , 7 , 3 and 2 , and makes the smallest and largest 4-digit numbers with them: 2347 and 7432. The difference between these two numbers is 7432 2347 = 5085. The sum of these two numbers is 9779. Choose 4- digits to make: a. the difference between the largest and smallest numbers greater than 5085. Number Play b. the difference between the largest and smallest numbers less than 5085. c. the sum of the largest and smallest numbers greater than 9779. d. the sum of the largest and smallest numbers less than 9779. 2. What is the sum of the smallest and largest 5-digit palindrome? What is their difference? 3. The time now is 10:01. How many minutes until the clock shows the next palindromic time? What about the one after that? 4. Howmany rounds does the number 5683 take to reach the Kaprekar constant? 3.8 Mental Math Observe the figure below.
