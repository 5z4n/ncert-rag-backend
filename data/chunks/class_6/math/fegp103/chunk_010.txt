all of different heights. Can they stand such that four of them say 1 and the last one says 0 ? Why or why not? Ans. Yes, they can, if they are standing in ascending order of height. [1] Q5. For this group of 5 children, is the sequence 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 possible? Ans. No; the tallest child at the end cannot say1. Q6. Is the sequence 0, 1, 2, 1, 0 possible? Why or why not? O) V Ans. Yes, it is possible. teas Q7. How would you rearrange the five children so that the maximum number of children say 2 ? Ans. At the most only 2 children can say 2 as given is the following arrangement. Section 3.2 Page No. 57 Figure it out Q1. Colour or mark the supercells in the table below. 3780 [3708 | 7308 [80009] 5583 | 52 Ans. 6828 670 9435 3780 3708 7308 8000 5583 52 [2] Q2. Fill the table below with only 4-digit numbers such that the supercells are exactly the coloured cells. 5346 [as 9635 Ans. One of the ways could be-5346; 9636.Try more 5346 1000 1100 [1200 [1300 [9635 [9636 | Q3. Fill the table below such that we get as many supercells as possible. Use numbers between 100 and 1000 without repetitions. Ans. Q4. Out of the 9 numbers, how many supercells are there in the table above? Ans. 5 Q5 Find out how many supercells are possible for different numbers of cells. Do you notice any pattern? What is the method to fill a given table to get the maximum number of supercells? Explore and share your strategy. Ans. For even number of cells say,2,4,6,... the number of supercells would be respectively, 2/2 =1,4/2 =2,6/2=3,... For odd number of cells , say 1,3,5,7,... the number of supercells would be respectively (1+1)/2= 1, (3+1)/2 = 2, (5+1)/2= 3,(7+1)/2 = 4... To get the maximum number ofsupercells, we have to start by filling the first cell as super cell & then fill alternately. Q6. Can you fill a supercell table without repeating numbers such that there are no supercells? Why or why not? Ans. No; the cell which is filled by the greatest number among the given numbers chosen, will become super cell irrespective of its position in the table. Q7. Will the cell having the largest number in a table always be a supercell? Can the cell having the smallest number in a table be a supercell? Why or why not? Ans. Yes, the largest number in a table will always be a supercell. No, the smallest number in a table can never be a supercell as the number in all the adjacent cells will be greater than it. Q8. Fill a table such that the cell having the second largest number is not a supercell. Ans. One of the ways could be1)/2/3)4)5/6)/7|91|8 [3] Q9. Fill a table such that the cell having the second largest number is not a supercell but the second
