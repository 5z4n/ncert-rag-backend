In section 8.1, we have learnt about evaporation. Let us explore it more! Observe your surroundings. What are the conditions that affect how fast water evaporates? What differences do you see in evaporation on a cold day versus a hot day? Discuss with your friends. The following words may help in your discussion fan, drying cloth, sweating, windy day, hot day, rainy day. Let us perform Activity 8.7 to investigate conditions that will affect how fast water will evaporate. Activity 8.7:Let usinvestigate = @ Take water in a small cap of a bottle (you may use sanitiser in place of water). @ Take the same amount of water in a plate. The exposed area of water in the bottle cap and the plate are different. @ Keep both of them near each other. Record the time taken for the water to completely evaporate in each case in Table 8.4. What What conditions did did we change in = we keep the same? this investigation? What did we , measure? A Journey through States of Water Let us investigate X N Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 8.indd 153 10/4/2024 3:12:07 PM Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6 Reflect on what you did really well in this activity. e Chapter 8.indd 154 Table 8.4: Findings of the investigation Time taken for Exposed area of water . complete evaporation Less (bottle cap) More (plate) What can you conclude from this investigation? If you spread out water on a plate, its area exposed to air is larger. Therefore, evaporation is faster. What would happen if milk is taken instead of water in the above activity? Other conditions which affect how fast water evaporates Design an activity similar to Activity 8.7 to find out what are the other conditions which can affect how fast water will evaporate. What would you change? What would you keep the same? Perform this activity, use Table 8.5 to record the data and discuss your observations. Table 8.5: Record the data of an investigation where one condition is changed and other condition remains the same Condition that is kept the same: Condition that is changed Time taken for complete evaporation Other than the conditions you have explored to find how water can be made to evaporate faster or slower, you can also conduct Activity 8.8 to explore it further.
