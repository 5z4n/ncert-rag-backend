Wood, cardboard and metals are examples of opaque materials. The materials through which objects can be seen, but not clearly, are known as translucent. Butter paper and frosted glass are examples of translucent materials. Lookat Fig. 6.5. Identify and label the nature of materials used by Ghulan (A), Sheeta (B), Sara (C) and Sheeta s brother (D).

He was feeling tired and thirsty. Ghulan s mother mixed a spoonful of sugar, a pinch of salt and some lemon juice in a glass tumbler of water and offered him this shikanji (lemonade) to drink. Ghulan noticed that while his mother was mixing sugar and salt in water, the salt and the sugar disappeared after a while. Let us try a simple activity to explore how different materials behave when we mix them in water! Activity 6.7: Let us explore] 9 Collect small amounts of sugar, salt, chalk powder, sand and sawdust. @ Take five glass tumblers and fill them about two-third with water. Puta teaspoonful of sugar in the first glass tumbler, salt in the second one, chalk powder in the third, sand in the fourth and sawdust in the fifth glass tumbler. On stirring, predict what will happen in each case. Use aspoon tostir well the contents ofeach glass tumbler. Wait for a few minutes and watch what happens. Write down your observations in Table 6.5.

Does We say that these materials dissolve in everything you water or, in other words, they are soluble put in water in water (Fig. 6.6a). Some materials do not disappear? mix with water and do not disappear even after we stir them for a long time. These materials are insoluble in water (Fig. 6.6b). Water plays an important role in the functioning of our body because it can dissolve a large number of materials. a (a) Soluble material in water (b) Insoluble material in water Materials Around Us Fig. 6.6: What disappears, what does not?
