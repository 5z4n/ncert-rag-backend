Activity 6.2: Let US gQrOUP 9 EE Group the objects shown in Fig. 6.1 based on any common property, such as shape, colour, hardness, softness, shine, dullness or materials they are made up of. Fig. 6.1: Objects around us @ Which property did you use to group the objects in Activity 6.2? Did your friends group objects based on similar properties? @ What did you learn from this activity? You must have noticed that an object can be made from different materials and some materials can be used to make more than one object. The method of arranging the objects into groups is called classification. Objects can be classified on the basis of a common property that they have. Similarly, we can classify materials based on certain properties. Materials Around Us Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 6.indd 103 10/4/2024 3:15:15 PM Activity 6.3: Let us think Let us think what materials we can use to make a tumbler. Fill in the names of the materials in the spaces provided in Fig. 6.2. Fig. 6.2: Materials used to make a tumbler Would it bea good idea to use paper-like materials for i making cooking e utensils? Why cannot a tumbler made of cloth be used for storing water? The materials that are required to make a tumbler should be capable of holding water. What decides which material should be used for making an object? We choose a material to make an object depending on its properties and the purpose for which the object is to be used. We may use different materials for making different parts of an object. For example, a pen may be made up of different materials like plastic, metal and ink.

Why are different materials used for making balls for various sports? Activity 6.4: Let us explore Fig. 6.3 illustrates a variety of balls that are of the same size but made up of different materials. @ Take each ball and drop it from a fixed height. @ Note the height to which the ball bounces and record it in Table 6.2. Identify the ball that achieves the highest bounce.
