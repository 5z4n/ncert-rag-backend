and translucent are picked up. Grid Students should randomly choose nine words from the given list and write them in the grid. Then, the facilitator either reads the definition of a word or the word itself (randomly) from the given list. The learners have to tick if the particular word is there in the grid. Whoever finishes ticking off all nine words first will shout out Hurray! That person will be the winner if his/her words are marked correctly. Let us enhance our learning Visit your kitchen and observe how your parents have organised various edibles. Can you suggest a better sorting method? Write it in your notebook.

Give your reasons for this. State whether the statements given below are True [T] or False [F]. Correct the False statement(s). (i) Wood is translucent while glass is opaque. [ ] (ii) Aluminium foil has lustre while an eraser does not. [ ] (iii) Sugar dissolves in water whereas sawdust does not. [ ] (iv) An apple is a matter because it occupies no space and has mass. [ ] We see chairs made up of various materials, such as wood, iron, plastic, bamboo, cement and stones. Following are some desirable properties of materials which can be used to make chairs. Which materials used to make chairs fulfil these properties the most? (i) Hardness (does not bend or shake on sitting even after long use). (ii) Lightweight (easy to lift or to take from one place to another). (iii) Does not feel very cold when sitting during winters. (iv) Can be cleaned regularly and made to look new even after long use. You need to have containers for collection of: (i) food waste, (ii) broken glass and (iii) wastepaper. Which materials will you choose for containers of these types of waste? What properties of materials do you need to think of? Air is all around us but does not hinder us from seeing each other. Whereas, if a wooden door comes in between, we cannot see each other. It is because air is ___.-_-_.-.-_-__-_and the wooden door is ____-._------------ . Choose the most appropriate option: (i) transparent, opaque (ii) translucent, transparent (iii) opaque, translucent (iv) transparent, translucent Imagine you have two mysterious materials, X and Y. When you try to press material X, it feels rigid and does not change its shape easily. On the other hand, material Y easily changes its shape when you press it. Now, when you mix both materials in water, only material X dissolves completely, Reprint
