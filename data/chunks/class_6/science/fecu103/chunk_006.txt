He analysed more than 500 Indian foods for their nutritional value and recommended an appropriate diet in the Indian context. He led surveys on the nutritional status of the Indian population, identifying widespread deficiencies in protein, energy, and other food components. This led to the implementation of the Mid Day Meal Programme in 2002, now a PM POSHAN initiative, to provide balanced food in the government-run and government-aided schools of our country. This scheme has played a role in improving the health and nutrition of millions of children nationwide.
