of a frog Chapter 10.indd 199 Activity 10.6: Let us analyse Avadhi and Aayush are dressed up in full sleeves shirts and full pants today. It has been raining intermittently for a week. They are going out with their classmates for an activity. After a brief walk led by their science teacher, they reach a shallow pond. It is surrounded by trees and tall grasses. The teacher cautions them to watch everything from a distance Reprint 2025-26 Living Creatures: Exploring their Characteristics 10/4/2024 3:12:00 PM Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6 Chapter 10.indd 200 without causing any disturbance. You may also go to a small water body during the rainy season with a facilitator and explore it by taking due safety precautions. You may notice a white jelly-like substance on the surface of water towards the edge of the pond (Fig. 10.7). This may also be attached to plants growing in or around the water. This jelly-like substance is actually a cluster of eggs of a frog and is known as spawn. Observe the features of all the stages of a frog shown in Fig. 10.7. How will you decide the sequence of the given stages (A, B, C, D, E, F)? Some of the stages show distinct changes in their initial and final shapes. Record these changes in Table 10.5. Fig 10.7: Different stages of a frog in a pond Based on the observations listed in Table 10.5, draw the life cycle of a frog. Compare the figure drawn by you with Fig. 10.8.

Reprint 2025-26 10/4/2024 3:12:01 PM Chapter 10.indd 201 Some of the stages have been clubbed together, for example, stages A and F in Fig. 10.7 have been kept under stage I. You will find four stages in the life cycle of a frog the egg stage, which progresses to the embryo stage; the tadpole stage, consisting of an early stage with a tail and no legs, and a late stage with hind legs; the froglet stage, and the adult frog stage (Fig. 10.8). Stage IV - Adult frog Stage I. Spawn (14 weeks) (Day 1) Stage III Froglet (12 weeks) Stage II,- Tadpole with legs Stage II, Tadpole with tail (8-10 weeks) (Day 7-10) Fig. 10.8: Life cycle ofa frog Discuss in the class along the following points: @ How are these eggs of a frog different from the other eggs that you may have seen? @ Which stage has the shortest duration? @ Is there a change in the habitat during the various stages in the life cycle of a frog? @ How do the special features support that stage? Observe Fig. 10.8. You will see that tadpoles develop legs but still have tails. Tails help them swim in water. Tadpoles grow gradually and start looking like little frogs called froglets. They still live in water
