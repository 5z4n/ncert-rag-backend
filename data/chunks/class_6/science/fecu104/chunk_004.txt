the direction of the approaching magnet? What do these observations suggest? Magnet A Magnet A & Magnet B Magnet B (a) (b) Fig. 4.8: Interaction between two bar magnets You will see that unlike poles of two magnets, that is, the North pole of one magnet and the South pole of another magnet, attract each other. The like poles, that is, either the North poles or the South poles of both magnets, repel ra | each other.

What do you observe this time? You will find that both the ends of the iron bar will be attracted by both the North and South poles ofthe magnet. From this activity, we find that a magnet can be identified by its property of repulsion. Take a magnetic compass and a bar magnet. Place the magnetic compass over a horizontal surface and wait for its needle to come to rest. Now slowly bring North pole of the bar magnet close to the North pole of the compass needle as shown in Fig. 4.9a. Observe the compass needle carefully. What do you observe? Does the needle deflect? If yes, in which direction? Now repeat the above step with the South pole of the bar magnet. Do you observe any difference this time? The compass needle is also a magnet. Will it show the same behaviour if a magnet is brought closer to it?

When the South pole of the magnet is brought closer to the North pole of the compass needle, it moves closer (Fig. 4.9)). Suppose we place a piece of wood between the compass needle and the magnet. Will this affect the deflection of the compass needle? Activity 4.7: Let us investigate @ Repeat the first or second part of Wood Activity 4.6. Without disturbing the bar magnet and magnetic compass, place a piece of wood between them, perpendicular to the table as shown in Fig. Fig. 4.10: Compass needle and a magnet 4.10. Observe the with a piece of wood in between compass needle carefully. Is there any effect on the deflection of compass needle due to the piece of wood? Record your observation in Table 4.2. @ Repeat the process by replacing the piece of wood with a cardboard sheet, thin plastic sheet, and a thin glass sheet.
