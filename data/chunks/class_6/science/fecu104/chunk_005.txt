Observe the with a piece of wood in between compass needle carefully. Is there any effect on the deflection of compass needle due to the piece of wood? Record your observation in Table 4.2. @ Repeat the process by replacing the piece of wood with a cardboard sheet, thin plastic sheet, and a thin glass sheet.

Glass You would observe that there is no appreciable change in the deflection of the needle when a sheet of any of the above material is placed between the magnet and the compass needle. Therefore, we can conclude that the magnetic effect can act through non-magnetic materials. mu 4.5 Fun with Magnets After learning about magnets, Reshma was excited and decided to set up some fun activities using magnets at her school fair. You may try making these yourself and may also think of some more fun ideas. Can we make a garland? (Fig. 4.11) Magnets can move some objects without touching them! Is that not amazing?

(Fig. 4.12) Can we pick out a steel paper clip fallen in water using a magnet, without getting our fingers or the magnet wet? (Fig. 4.13) Fig. 4.12: Steel balls in a maze Fig. 4.13: Steel paperclip in water Will the two cars speed towards each other or run away from each other when brought closer?

The poles of a magnet always exist in pairs. A single North pole or a single South pole cannot exist. Magnetic materials are the materials that are attracted towards a magnet. Non-magnetic materials are the materials that are not attracted towards a magnet. A freely suspended magnet rests along the north-south direction. The needle
