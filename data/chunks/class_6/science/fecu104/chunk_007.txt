can you find its poles with the help of another magnet which has its poles marked? Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 4.indd 75 10/4/2024 3:22:46 PM 7. A bar magnet has no markings to indicate its poles. How would you find out near which end its North pole is located without using another magnet? 8. Ifthe earth is itself a magnet, can you guess the poles of earth s magnet by looking at the direction of the magnetic compass? 9. While a mechanic was repairing a gadget using a screw driver, the steel screws kept falling down. Suggest a way to solve the problem of the mechanic on the basis of what you have learnt in this chapter. X 10. Tworing magnets X and Yarearranged as shown in Fig. 4.16. It is observed that the y magnet X does not move down further. What could be the possible reason? Suggest a way to bring the magnet Xin Fig. 4.16: Two ring magnets contact with magnet Y, without pushing either of the magnets. 11. Three magnets are arranged on a table in the form of the shape shown in Fig. 4.17. What is the polarity, N or S, at the ends 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 of the magnets? Polarity of one end (5) is given for you. Fig. 4.17: Three bar magnets Learning further Using 3-4 different magnets, try to lift steel pins or U-clips and check which magnet picks up the largest number of pins. Discuss with your friends why different magnets might have picked up different numbers of pins. @ Make a toy Hopping Frog as a combined class activity with the help of your teacher. For constructing the toy, fix ring magnets in an alternate North-South fashion along the Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6 Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 4.indd 76 10/4/2024 3:22:59 PM Chapter 4.indd 77 length of a scale using glue (Fig. 4.18a). Paint a frog on paper, cut along the outline and glue a ring magnet at its base. Take a transparent, flexible plastic strip (Fig. 4.18a) of asmaller size and glue it to the ring magnet which is attached to the frog. Fig. 4.18: My hopping frog When you slide the plastic strip (with frog) over the scale (Fig. 4.18b), you can observe the frog hopping. Find out about the Maglev Train and try to make its model. Try to find out why there is a need to make magnets of different shapes. Collect information related to the use of magnets in the field of medicine.
