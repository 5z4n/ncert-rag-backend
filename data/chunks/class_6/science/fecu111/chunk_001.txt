Can you name some gases which are present in the air? Air contains nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide and other gases in small quantities. Fig. 11.1 gives the composition of air in percentage. Notice that in Fig. 11.1 there are 100 squares. Out of 100 squares, 78 are occupied by nitrogen, 21 are occupied by oxygen, and 1 by argon, carbon dioxide and other gases. More to know! Composition of air || Nitrogen (78%) || Oxygen (21%) || Argon, carbon dioxide ooo ctr ns Fig. 11.1: Composition of air You notice the presence of air when the leaves of a tree rustle, the clothes hanging on a clothes line sway, or the pages of an open book begin to flutter once a fan is switched on. Moving air is called wind. Sometimes it blows fast, for example, during a storm, and sometimes it blows gently as a breeze. You must have played with a firki (paper pinwheel) many times. Let us make a firki by performing Activity 11.2.

Does the firkirotate? When you move it a little back and forth, the firki rotates. What makes a firki rotate? It is the wind that makes a firki rotate. The working of a windmill is similar to that of a firki. Wind rotates the wings of a windmill. Windmills can be used to run flour mills, to pull up water from a well, or to generate electricity. In India, there are many windmill farms. A windmill farm is an area that has a large number of windmills which use the energy of the wind to generate electricity (Fig. 11.3).
