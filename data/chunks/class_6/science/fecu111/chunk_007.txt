such as sand, insects and worms. There may be many small organisms that we cannot see with our naked eyes. Plants and animals also become part of the soil as they decompose and decay. The soil samples collected from different places may be of different colours because they may contain different materials. Have you ever wondered how soil is formed? Soil is formed by the disintegration (breaking apart) of rocks by actions of the Sun, water and living organisms over a long time (thousands of years). There are different types of soils. Some are good for growing certain types of Ploughing Nature s Treasures Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 11.indd 219 10/7/2024 9:57:12 AM plants while some are good for making bricks for buildings. Forests have a variety of soils. Soil is a precious treasure that supports biodiversity. You may have seen rocks in your surroundings. Rocks are used in the construction of houses, buildings, temples, roads, dams and table tops. Some rocks, like slate, are used for roofing (Fig. 11.6) and laterite can be used as a building material, like bricks (Fig. 11.7). Some of the important rocks are granite, sandstone and marble. Human beings have been using rocks to make tools such as hand axes (Fig. 11.8a) and arrowheads (Fig. 11.8b) since thousands of years. Fig. 11.7: Laterite rocks used as bricks Fig. 11.8 (b): Arrowheads made from stone What are rocks made up of? They are made up of minerals. Important metals, such as aluminium, gold, copper and iron are extracted from minerals. Minerals are used in the manufacturing ofairplanes, cars, jewellery, cosmetics, and Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6 Mining of marble Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 11.indd 220 10/4/2024 3:05:28 PM electrical and electronic equipment. For example, the basic mobile phones that we use contain about a dozen minerals like gold, silver, copper, cobalt, etc. Naturally occurring gold Some minerals found in nature Rocks play a vital role in our lives. It takes thousands to millions of years to form rocks. Therefore, it is important to conserve and use them responsibly. Do you know how rocks and minerals are transported from one location to another? Most vehicles that we use for transportation use fossil fuels. Let us explore more about fossil fuels. mee | 1.6 Fossil Fuels The reason is that they use different types of fuels. For example, petrol and diesel. Surya, why do different types of vehicles go to different filling stations? Nature s Treasures Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 11.indd 221 10/4/2024 3:05:29 PM Let us explore more about it by performing Activity 11.5. Activity 11.5: Let us conduct a survey = es Conduct a survey of vehicles in your neighbourhood. @ Which types of vehicles are there? What types of fuels do they use? Record the information that you collect in Table 11.3. Table 11.3: Types of vehicles and fuels used Type of vehicle Type of fuel used What are the most common types of fuels used? Petrol and diesel are the two most widely
