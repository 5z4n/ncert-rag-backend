Laboratory thermometer Beaker ee $ = Ss-w Warm rater Fig.7.4: Measuring temperature of warm water @ While reading the thermometer, the eye should be directly in line with the level of the liquid column to be read (Fig. 7.4). Activity 7.5: Let us measure I @ Take some warm water in a beaker. @ Dip the thermometer in water so that the bulb is immersed in water (Fig. 7.4). @ Observe the rise of liquid column in the thermometer. Wait till the column stops rising and note the temperature (do not wait too long; otherwise, the water itself will start to cool). What is the temperature of water measured by you? Compare it with the readings of your friends. Do you notice that, as soon as you take the thermometer out of the water, the level of liquid column begins to fall? This means that the temperature must be read while the thermometer is immersed in water.

Why are there differences in their readings? Discuss the possible reasons amongst yourselves. Maybe, the correct way of reading temperature was not followed by all the students. 7.3.3 Air temperature You might have seen thermometers, suchastheoneshowninFig.7.5,hung on walls of your school laboratory, doctor s clinic, and hospitals. These give an approximate idea of the room temperature. Have you seen weather reports in newspapers, TV news or internet? These reports also mention the maximum and minimum = air temperature of the day. Fig.7.5: Room thermometer Activity 7.7: Let.us analyse SS @ Read or listen to the weather reports for a place for 10 successive days. @ Record the maximum and minimum air temperature for each day in Table 7.3.

Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 7.indd 134 10/4/2024 3:15:06 PM Chapter 7.indd 135 Does the maximum and minimum temperature stay at the same level during these days? Because weather depends on several factors, these temperatures usually vary every day. Generally, as we approach the summer season, the temperature rises and during the winter season it falls.
