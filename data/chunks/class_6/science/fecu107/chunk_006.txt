Table 7.3: Maximum and minimum air temperature 1. Curiosity | Textbook of Science| Grade 6 10. Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 7.indd 134 10/4/2024 3:15:06 PM Chapter 7.indd 135 Does the maximum and minimum temperature stay at the same level during these days? Because weather depends on several factors, these temperatures usually vary every day. Generally, as we approach the summer season, the temperature rises and during the winter season it falls. More to know! Anna Mani (1918-2001) was an Indian scientist, also known as the Weather Woman of India . She invented and built a large number of weather measurement instruments. This reduced the reliance of India on other nations for such instruments. She also explored the possibilities of using wind and solar energy in India. Her work helped India to become one of the global leaders in renewable energy.

The three most-used scales of temperature are: (a) the Celsius scale, (b) the Fahrenheit scale, and (c) the Kelvin scale. The units of temperature in these scales are (a) degree Celsius, denoted by C, (b) degree Fahrenheit, denoted by F, and (c) kelvin, denoted by K. The SI unit for temperature is kelvin. A clinical thermometer is used for measuring body temperature. Normal temperature of a healthy human adult is taken to be 37.0 C or 98.6 F. Laboratory thermometers typically have a temperature range from -10 C to 110 C.
