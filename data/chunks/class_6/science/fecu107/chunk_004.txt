Can you now find the smallest value that this thermometer can read? For the thermometer shown in Fig. 7.3b, the temperature difference indicated between 0 C and 10 C or between 10 C and 20 C is 10 C. And the number of divisions between these marks are 10 divisions. So, one small division can read 10/10 = 1 C. That is, the smallest value that this thermometer can read is 1 C. Your school laboratory may have thermometers for which the range and the value of the smallest division may be different. It is, therefore, always necessary to look carefully at the thermometer you are about to use. You have learnt how to find the temperature range of a given laboratory thermometer. You have Fig. 7.300): also learnt how to find the smallest value that a Closeup ofa givenlaboratory thermometer can read. We will partofthe now learn how to measure temperature using a thermometer Jahoratory thermometer. But, let us first learn Tie 730 how to use a laboratory thermometer correctly. Temperature and its Measurement Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 7.indd 131 10/4/2024 3:14:58 PM Correct way of measuring temperature using a laboratory thermometer @ When the thermometer is immersed in water, its bulb should not touch the bottom or the sides of the beaker.
