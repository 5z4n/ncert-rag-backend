You have also recorded movement of animals in Table 2.5. Does the movement of these animals depend upon their surroundings? Let us consider fishes and goat as examples. Fishes live in water. They have streamlined bodies and fins for movement in water (Fig. 2.8a). Goats live in grassy areas and move with the help of legs (Fig. 2.8b). The sizes and shapes of animals also differ from one another.

List the names of plants and animals you or your classmates have observed in the regions given in the table or already know about. A few examples are given. You can add more.

You might observe from Table 2.6 that the plants and animals found in one kind of region are different from those found in fleshy stems in a desert During a discussion in the classroom, Alex recalls that he observed cactus plants with thick and fleshy stems in the deserts of Rajasthan (Fig. 2.9). Maya shares that she saw deodar trees in the Himalayas of Himachal Pradesh (Fig. 2.10). These trees are conical in shape and have flexible and sloping branches. Notice that these two types of plants Fig. 2.10: A deodar found in different regions are different tree in the mountains Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6 Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 2.indd 24 10/21/2024 9:59:42 AM Chapter 2.indd 25 from each other. Why is it so? Why does the biodiversity of a region vary from that of another? Let us find out. There is very little water available in the deserts. A hot desert is typically very hot during the day and very cold at night. Therefore, you will find plants and animals in these areas that can tolerate and survive both the hot conditions during the day and cold conditions at night. The fleshy stems of plants found in the desert can store water and help them tolerate the hot conditions in these places. The mountains in extremely cold regions experience frequent snowfall. In order to survive in such conditions, some of the trees have the ability
