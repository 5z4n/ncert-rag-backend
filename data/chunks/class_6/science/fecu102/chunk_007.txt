of animals? What features can you think of to group them? In Activity 2.3, you have already set some bases for grouping animals. Let us explore a few of these in more detail. Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6 Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 2.indd 20 10/4/2024 3:19:55 PM Activity 2.9: Let us find out ee You have recorded the movement of a few animals in Table 2.2. You may have also observed how other animals move from place to place. Let us now think about the types of movement in animals. A number of animals are shown in Fig. 2.7. You can add more animals that you may have observed and create a poster on the variety of animals. Which body parts are used by the animals in the poster you created and those in Fig. 2.7 for movement? Fig. 2.7: Diversity in animals @ List these animals in Table 2.5. @ Note the ways in which these animals move and name the body parts used for movement. Some examples are given in Table 2.5.

Fish Fins 6. Any other 7. 8. What conclusions can you draw from the data given in Table 2.5? Different animals have different types of movement. Animals can fly, run, crawl, walk, hop or jump, and so on. They use different body parts for moving from one place to another. They may use wings, legs, and other parts that help them to move. Here, we have identified animals based on the types of movement and the body parts used for movement. How can we group animals based on their movements? Additionally, many animals differ from each other in shape, size, structure, colour, and other features. Some of these features can also be used to group animals in various ways. Like plants, grouping of animals is important for understanding their diversity. Janaki Ammal (1897-1984) was an Indian botanist dedicated to environmental work and helped to document and preserve India s rich plant biodiversity. She played a key role in the Save Silent Valley movement. As the head of the Botanical Survey of India, she initiated programmes to document the plant diversity of India.

You have also recorded movement of animals in Table 2.5. Does the movement of these animals depend upon their surroundings? Let us consider fishes and goat as examples. Fishes live in water. They have streamlined bodies and fins for
