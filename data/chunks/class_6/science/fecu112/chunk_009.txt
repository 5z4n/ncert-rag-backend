Earth in nearly 27 days. @ The Sun, eight planets, their moons, and many smaller objects including asteroids and comets, together form the Solar System. Our Solar System is part of the Milky Way Galaxy. Sw ( LA Let us enhance our learning 1.

(i) Jupiter (ii) Pluto (iii) Neptune (iv) Saturn Which is the brighter star, the Pole Star or Sirius? An artist s representation of the Solar System is given in Fig. 12.12. Is the order of the planets correct? If not, write the correct order in the boxes in the figure. Fig. 12.12 A portion of night sky with stars is shown in Fig. 12.13. Look carefully and identify the groups of stars that form the patterns the Big Dipper and the Little Dipper. Draw lines to connect the stars for these patterns and label them. Also, identify and label the Pole Star. You may refer to Fig. 12.4 for help. Fig. 12.13 Reprint 2025-26 10/4/2024 3:11:30 PM Chapter 12.indd 251 8. 10. 11. A portion of the night sky is shown in Fig. 12.14. Draw lines to connect the stars for Orion and label the star Sirius. You may refer to Fig. 12.3. Fig. 12.14 You can see stars fading away at dawn and appearing at dusk. During the day we do not see the stars. Explain why. During a clear night, try to observe the Big Dipper 3-4 times at an interval of 2 to 3 hours. Also try to locate the Pole Star each time. Does the Big Dipper appear to move? Draw a rough sketch to illustrate this, mentioning the time in each case. Think about the night sky and write a poem or a story on it. Learning further Pa Try to find out the names of planets in your local language. Also, find out the stories associated with stars and constellations in your region. Present these stories in a pictorial form. If there is a planetarium or a science museum nearby, then you can visit it, especially if a night sky observation session is scheduled by them. You will get to see the Moon, the planets and the stars through a telescope. If you visit the planetarium during daytime, you can
