moves along a straight line, its motion is called linear motion. Identify such linear motion in your surroundings. Fig. 5.14: Linear motion But do things always move along a straight line? You might have enjoyed playing on swings and merry-go-rounds. Are these types of motion also linear motion? Activity 5.4: Let us investigate LS Tie an eraser (or a potato) to one end of a thread. Hold the other end of the thread with your hand and whirl it (Fig. 5.15). @ Observe its motion. Is the motion of the eraser the same as that of a merry-goround? When an object moves along a circular path, its motion is called circular motion.

Keep your hand steady. @ Using the other hand, take the eraser slightly to one side and then release (Fig. 5.16). Does it start moving to and fro? Is its motion similar to the motion of a swing? When an object moves to and fro about some fixed position, its motion is called oscillatory motion.

Hold its one end pressed to a table. You may use a few books or a brick to hold it (Fig. 5.17). @ Press the free end of the strip slightly and let it go. @ Observe the motion of this end of the strip. Does it move up and down? This is also an example of oscillatory motion. Fig. 5.17: Oscillatory motion of a metal strip More to know! Activity 5.7: Let us identify SE Look at the picture of a children s park (Fig. 5.18) or visit a children s park. @ Observe different kinds of motions. Classify them as linear, circular or oscillatory motion. Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6 List them in Table 5.4. Give your justification for why you put each in a certain category.

The SI unit of length is metre. Its symbol is m. 1 km = 1000 m, 1 m= 100 cm, 1 cm =10 mm. When distance is stated with respect to a fixed object or
