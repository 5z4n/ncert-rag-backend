all five of them put their handspans along each other and arrive at the conclusion that the lengths of their handspans are different. Deepa says thoughtfully, No wonder people use scales and measuring tapes. Deepa and her friends compare the length of the table with the length of their handspans. The length of the table is expressed in terms of their handspans. Here, the handspan used for measurement is an example ofa unit. And the length is expressed in two parts, anumber and a unit. For example, if the length of the table is found to be 13 handspans, then 13 is the number and handspar is the unit selected for the measurement. However, handspans and other similar units, such as length of hand, foot, fist or fingers, differ from person to person. Thus, there is a need for such a unit for which measurements of the same length made by different people do not differ.

However, when people started travelling from one place to another, it created a lot of confusion. This led to the different countries coming together and adopting a set of standard units of measurement. The system of units now used is known as the International System of Units or SI units. The SI unit of length is metre. Its symbol is m. A metre scale is shown in Fig. 5.2. One metre (m) is divided into 100 equal divisions. Each division is called a centimetre (cm). You may be familiar with a smaller part of the metre scale, typically 15 cm long, shown in Fig. 5.3. Look carefully at the 15-cm scale. It has markings (in cm) from 0 to 15. The length of any section between two consecutive big marks, such as between 1 and 2 or between 5 and 6, is 1 cm. Observe that these sections Reprint 2025-26 Fig. 5.2: A metre scale 10/4/2024 3:15:45 PM Chapter 5.indd 83 Fig. 5.3: A 15-cm scale of 1 cm length are further divided into 10 equal parts. The length of one of these smaller parts is called a millimetre (mm). 1 mm is the smallest value of length that you can measure using this scale. 1 mm is equal to one-tenth of a centimeter (1 mm = 0.1 cm). For measuring larger lengths, we use a larger unit called a kilometre (km) which is equal to 1000 metres. And for measuring smaller lengths, we use units such as centimetre or millimetre. Would it be convenient to use the unit metre to measure larger lengths, such as the length of a railway track between two cities, or to measure smaller lengths, such as the thickness of a page of a book? tem =1000m | 1m=100cm Reprint 2025-26 1/2 1/3 114 115 Measurement of Length and Motion
