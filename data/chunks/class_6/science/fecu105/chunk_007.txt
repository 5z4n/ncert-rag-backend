The SI unit of length is metre. Its symbol is m. 1 km = 1000 m, 1 m= 100 cm, 1 cm =10 mm. When distance is stated with respect to a fixed object or point, then this point is called a reference point. An object is said to be in motion if its position changes with respect to a reference point with time. When an object moves along a straight line, its motion is called linear motion. When an object moves along a circular path, its motion is called circular motion. When any object moves to and fro about any fixed position, its motion is called oscillatory motion.

Match the lengths with the units suitable for measuring those lengths. Table 5.5 Column I Column II Distance between Delhi and Lucknow centimetre Thickness of a coin kilometre Length of an eraser metre Length of school ground millimetre Read the following statements and mark True (T) or False (F) against each. (i) The motion of a car moving on a straight road is an example of linear motion. [ ] (ii) Any object which is changing its position with respect to a reference point with time is said to be in motion. [ ] (iii) 1km=100cm [ ] Which of the following is not a standard unit of measuring length? (i) millimetre (ii) centimetre (iii) kilometre (iv) handspan Search for the different scales or measuring tapes at your home and school. Find out the smallest value that can be measured using each of these scales. Record your observations in a tabular form. Suppose the distance between your school and home is 1.5 km. Express it in metres. Reprint 2025-26 Measurement of Length and Motion ) 10/4/2024 3:17:56 PM Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6 Chapter 5.indd 98 10. 11. Take a tumbler or a bottle. Measure the length of the curved part of the base of glass or bottle and record it. Measure the height of your friend and express it in (i) metres (ii) centimetres and (iii) millimetres. You are given a coin. Estimate how many coins are required to be placed one after the other lengthwise, without leaving any gap between them, to cover the whole length of the chosen side of a notebook. Verify your estimate by measuring the same side of the notebook and the size of the coin using a 15-cm scale. Give two examples each for linear, circular and oscillatory motion. Observe different objects around you. It is easier to express the lengths of some objects in mm,
