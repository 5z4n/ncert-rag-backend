a larger unit called a kilometre (km) which is equal to 1000 metres. And for measuring smaller lengths, we use units such as centimetre or millimetre. Would it be convenient to use the unit metre to measure larger lengths, such as the length of a railway track between two cities, or to measure smaller lengths, such as the thickness of a page of a book? tem =1000m | 1m=100cm Reprint 2025-26 1/2 1/3 114 115 Measurement of Length and Motion 10/4/2024 3:15:57 PM es 5.3 Correct Way of Measuring Length Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6 Chapter 5.indd 84 For measuring any length, we need an appropriate scale. For example, if you want to measure the length of your pencil, you may use a 15-cm scale. Similarly, if the height of a room is to be measured, you may need a metre scale or a measuring tape. You cannot directly measure the girth of a tree or the size of your chest using a metre scale. For such measurements, flexible measuring tape, such as a tailor s tape is more suitable. While measuring lengths, we need to take care of some points. What is the correct way to place the scale? Place the scale in contact with the object along its length as shown in Fig. 5.4. (a) Correct (b) Incorrect Fig. 5.4: Method of placing the scale What is the correct position of the eye while reading the scale? For example, if you are trying to measure the length of a pencil by aligning it with a scale, the position of your eye should be directly above the tip of the pencil (Fig. 5.5).

If the ends of the scale are broken or the zero marking is not clear, it can still be used for measurement. With such a scale, use any other full mark of the scale, say, 1.0 cm (Fig. 5.6). Then you must subtract the reading of this mark from the reading at the other end. For example, in Fig. 5.6, the reading at one end is 1.0 cm and at the other end, it is 10.4 cm. Therefore, the length of the object is 10.4 cm-1.0 cm = 9.4 cm.
