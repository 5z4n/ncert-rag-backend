5.21. Now use your imagination and expand it to a size as big as you want. How tall am I? Stand along a wall and with the help of an adult, mark your height (Fig. 5.22). Repeat it every three months to maintain a height record for yourself and your siblings. Let us design a fun method for measuring the distance between two places by using a bicycle. Attach a flexible metal strip to the spoke of the front wheel in such a manner that it hits the frame of the bicycle holding the wheel, every time it crosses it and produces a sound (Fig. 5.23). Fig. 5.22: Measuring height Now ride the bicycle slowly and count the number of times in which sound occurred. The number will give you the number of turns of your wheel made. Now measure the length of the outer boundary of the wheel using a string as done in Fig. 5.8. Multiply this length by the number of turns of the wheel. This is the distance you travelled. Such methods are actually used to measure the distance for roadrunning races. Try to find out about a Jones Counter which is attached to a bicycle wheel and is used for measuring distances.
