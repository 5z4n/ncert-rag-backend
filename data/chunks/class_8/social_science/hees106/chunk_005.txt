its laws; = answerable to the Lok Sabha, through mechanisms like the Question Hour which require ministers to justify their actions and decisions. The Question Hour in the Lok Sabha is a select period (typically the first hour of a Parliamentary session) where MPs can ask the ministers questions about government policies and activities. It is a process of the Parliament that holds the Executive accountable (i.e., it must justify all actions and decisions). Special committees also hold meetings where ministries have to explain and answer questions about their policies. These committees may include MPs from different political parties. Chapter 6.indd 149 The Parliament isn t always formal and serious. Sometimes, the atmosphere is set through poetry and humour! Example 1: Verse in the Parliament While presenting the Union Budget for the year 2025-26 on the 1*tof February, 2025, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman recited the following verse from Tirukkural (an ancient Indian treatise in Tamil on ethics and morality): Vaanokki vaalum ulakellaam Mannavan koalnokki vaalung kudi. It means: Just as living beings live expecting rains, Citizens live expecting good governance. On hearing this, there was an enthusiastic thumping of desks from the Treasury Benches. * Example 2: Humour in the Parliament In 2011, during a spirited debate in the Lok Sabha, Parliamentarian Sushma Swaraj quoted a poetic verse to criticise the government: Tu idhar udhar kina baat kar, yeh bata ki kafila kyun luta, humein rahjano se gila nahi, teri rahbari ka sawal hai. Don't change the topic, just say why the caravan was looted. We have no complaint with the robbers, but this is a question on your leadership. In response, the then Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh calmly replied with another poetic line: Maana ki teri deed ke qabil nahin hoon main, tu mera shauq dekh mera intezar dekh. I admit that Iam not worthy of your sight; you should look at my zeal and my perseverance. 6 - The Parliamentary System: Legislature and Executive Governance and Democracy 08-07-2025 10:12:06 Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 8 Part 1 "re fa: 33) ae Pe PARLIAMENT OF INDIA RAIYA SABHA DEPARTMENT-RELATED PARLIAMENTARY STANDING COMMITTEE ON HEALTH & FAMILY WELFARE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY SECOND REPORT ON ACTION TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS/ OBSERVATIONS CONTAINED IN THE 156 REPORT ON REVIEV) OF NATIONAL AYUSH MISSION (Presented (o the Rajye Sabha on 20" December, 2024) (Laid on the Table of Lok Sabha on 4" February, 2025) ao GUE oe Fae CS bos Kd Car riNgR.
