the world GDP kept declining throughout the colonial rule, reaching hardly 5 per cent at the time of Independence. In less than two centuries, one of the richest lands of the world had become one of the poorest. Dismantling traditional governance structures Before British colonisation, India possessed well-organised systems of local self-governance. Village councils managed community affairs, resolved disputes, and organised public works such as irrigation, roads, etc. Regional kingdoms maintained complex administrative structures that had evolved over centuries to address local needs and conditions. Charles Metcalfe, an acting Governor-General in the 1830s, described the system and its efficiency in this important statement: C C The village communities are little republics, having Chapter 4.indd 101 nearly everything they want within themselves. They seem to last where nothing else lasts. Dynasty after dynasty tumbles down; revolution succeeds to revolution; but the village community remains the same. ... This union of the village communities, each one forming a separate little state in itself, has contributed more than any other cause to the preservation of the people of India. The British systematically dismantled these indigenous governance systems, replacing them with a centralised bureaucracy designed primarily to facilitate tax collection and maintain order, rather than promote public welfare. This transformation destroyed centuries-old mechanisms of community decision-making. The introduction of British codes of law disregarded customary laws and practices that had governed Indian communities for generations. While presented as modernisation, this imposition of a foreign system unsuited to India alienated ordinary Indians from the judicial system, creating courts that were expensive, time-consuming, and conducted in a foreign language.

In India, Orientalists (now called Indologists ) were often scholars of Sanskrit, Pali, Persian and other Exploring Society: India and Beyond | Grade 8 Part 1 e languages. British reports reported hundreds of thousands of village schools across India (for instance, 100,000 to 150,000 of them in Bengal and Bihar up to 1830!) where young natives are taught reading, writing and arithmetic, upon a system so economical, ... and at the same time so simple and effectual... A sharp turning point in India s educational history was marked by the notorious 1835 Minute on Indian Education of British historian and politician, Thomas B. Macaulay. In it, although he admitted that he had no knowledge of either Sanskrit or Arabic, he expressed his conviction that European knowledge was vastly superior to India s: I have never found one among them [Orientalists]
