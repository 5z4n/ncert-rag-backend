a French empire in India. Dupleix, who served as Governor-General of French India from 1742 to 1754, pioneered several colonial strategies that would later be adopted by the British. In particular, he trained Indian soldiers in European military techniques, creating disciplined infantry soldiers known as sepoys. Dupleix also developed the strategy of indirect rule through puppet Indian rulers, who were installed through interventions in local succession disputes. The French colonial ambitions in India were ultimately checked during the Carnatic Wars (1746-1763), a series of conflicts between Britain and France. Despite initial successes under Dupleix, who captured Madras (present-day Chennai) in 1746, the French ultimately lost ground to the British and their colony was reduced to Pondicherry and a few smaller enclaves. Like the Dutch, and unlike the Portuguese, the French colonial powers did not much intervene in Indians social and religious life. A rare exception was the destruction in 1748 of Pondicherry s large Vedapurishwaran temple, ordered by Dupleix on the persistent request of Pondicherry s Jesuit priests and Dupleix s own wife, with a view to asserting the dominance of Christianity. Generally, however, the French had to be content with a modest amount of trade with India. 05-07-2025 17:14:37 Chapter 4.indd 91 SINAN ABN } MUA UUVPURTNELTRELOLIAGALEARLLOEELUELELCCUADEL DUS SSUEUOGUOLOLEIIE O00 010.
