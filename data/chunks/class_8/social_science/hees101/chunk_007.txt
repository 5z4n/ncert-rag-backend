in the short term. However, this concern is not particular to Punjab; it affects many other states. In the 1960s, farmers shifted to high-yielding varieties of wheat and paddy. These required more water than the traditional seeds, and farmers began to extract groundwater to meet this need. In addition, the supply of free power led to the over-pumping of groundwater (a situation still prevalent in much of India today). Modern farming techniques also required the use of chemical pesticides and fertilisers. The combined effect of these factors is that the groundwater level in a large part of Punjab (see fig. 1.17) has become inaccessible till depths of about 30 metres; and the chemicals from the pesticides and fertilisers have dissolved in the groundwater causing health hazards. im N $ Z ee Fig. 1.15.

We can see that food security was ensured for the short term, but the long-term consequences will take time and effort to heal. 74 00'00" E 75 00'00" E 76 00'00" E 77 00'00" E Depth to Water Level Map of Punjab State & Chandigarh (U.T.)

A mud structure built in the 12" century and refurbished later using sandstone. We cannot imagine life without cement. Our houses, schools and hospitals and other buildings, bridges, roads and airports, all require cement. The production of cement has been listed as one of the most polluting industries. The process of production releases fine dust that enters our lungs and those of animals damaging them, settles on leaves of plants decreasing their yields, and causes soil and water pollution too. The Central Pollution Control Board has created guidelines for cement factories to ensure that the pollution is minimised or eliminated. In addition, thereisa move towards creating alternative materials that reduce pollution. These include the use of traditional materials like stone and mud, new plant-based materials and recycled materials from waste plastic. \ Fig. 1.19.
