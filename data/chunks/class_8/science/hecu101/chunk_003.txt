In the final chapter of this book, we can put 30 20 it all together and try to understand what makes Earth just right for life and to recognise the urgent challenges that our planet now faces. Most importantly, the Earth lies at the perfect distance from the Sun, where water remains liquid, and it has an atmosphere that provides the oxygen we breathe while shielding us from harmful ultraviolet rays. But human activities on the planet can cause small changes in the temperature of the Earth, disrupting climate patterns, with dangerous consequences. Chapter l.indd 5 At the heart of both the problem and any possible solution is us. We are the ones influencing Earth s climate. But we are also the ones who can and must use science to understand these changes and guide our actions. The same scientific principles that we have guided our journey through the middle stages observing, measuring, experimenting will be key in helping us protect the delicate balance on which life depends. The challenges ahead won t always be easy. We hope some of you will try to solve these difficult problems with Curiosity as your guide. 6/28/2025 11:39:19 AM To help you think like a scientist, let us go back to a question we asked on the first page: Why is one side of a puri thinner than the other? Firstly, remember that science is everywhere! You don t need a fancy laboratory to do simple experiments. Even your kitchen at home is a wonderful place to observe and ask questions. All you need is to start with curiosity, careful observation, and asking what happens if...2 Have you noticed how a puri or a batura puffs up when placed in hot oil? Or how a phulka_ swells when put directly on the flame. Why does it puff up like a balloon? And why is one side thinner than the other? These are questions a scientist might ask and you can too! Let s see how we can investigate this simple everyday phenomenon like a scientist would. First, we will try to ask a scientific question. What are the different things that may change the way a
