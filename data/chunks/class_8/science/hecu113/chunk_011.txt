needs to grow until it is born. This is a different way of giving nutrition to the developing baby, compared to animals like birds that lay eggs. What are the advantages and disadvantages of giving birth to young ones vs. laying eggs? Do you think animals like dogs, cows, or humans could lay eggs like birds? Why or why not? 13.6 What Are the Threats to Life on Earth? We know that life on Earth depends on a delicate balance of living and non-living things working together. But human actions are disturbing this balance. Even small changes in global temperature, oxygen levels, or the ozone layer can put life at risk. Today, the biggest environmental challenges that we face are climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution together known as the triple planetary crisis. Burning fossil fuels like coal and oil releases greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane. These trap even more heat in the atmosphere which causes global warming. Normally, Earth keeps a balance since trees, plants, and even tiny ocean planktons absorb carbon dioxide as they grow. But when we burn fossil fuels, we release extra carbon that has been locked underground for millions of years. The Earth cannot absorb this fast enough, so the heat builds up. Even a small increase in temperature can melt ice caps, raise sea levels which could flood many coastal cities, cause extreme weather conditions, and lead to many plants and animals disappearing. These long-term changes in temperature, rainfall, and weather patterns are called climate change. When natural habitats are destroyed, plants and animals may disappear, upsetting ecosystems. For example, as we saw in Chapter 12, if grasses vanish, animals that feed on them like deer or grasshoppers struggle to survive. And without herbivores, predators like tigers or foxes lose their food too. Every type of living thing has a role, and losing even a few weakens nature s ability to support life. 6/28/2025 6:16:18 PM Pollutionadds tothe problem. Air pollution from factories, vehicles, and burning fuels harms both people and the nature. It can cause breathing problems, damage crops, and lead to smog and acid rain (Fig. 13.15). Climate change affects everything from crop growth and water supply to wildlife habitats and human health. To protect life on Earth, we need to cut pollution, use cleaner energy, and make wiser choices. We have also learnt that life on Earth flourishes within a delicate balance supported by interdependent natural systems. However, this balance is increasingly threatened by human actions. For example, a little less or more of oxygen in air, or a little lower or higher temperature of the Earth, or a little less of ozone in the atmosphere, could endanger life on the Earth. Fig. 13.15: Air pollution Ever heard of ... Countries around the world have made global agreements to protect the environment. The Montreal Protocol (1987) helped reduce harmful chemicals like Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), allowing the ozone layer to slowly recover. The Earth Summit (1992) led to international efforts on
