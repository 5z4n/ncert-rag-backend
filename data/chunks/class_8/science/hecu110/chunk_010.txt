mirror can be enlarged, diminished or of the same size as the object, and it may be erect or inverted, depending upon the distance of the object from the mirror. Image formed by a convex mirror is always erect and diminished in size. Two laws of reflection are: o The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. o The incident ray, the normal to the mirror at the point of incidence, and the reflected ray, all lie in the same plane. The laws of reflection are valid for all kinds of mirrors plane, concave, and convex. A concave mirror converges the light beams while a convex mirror diverges it. Image formed by a convex lens can be enlarged, diminished or of the same size as the object, and it may be erect or inverted, depending upon the distance of the object from the mirror. Image formed by a concave lens is always erect and diminished in size. @ Aconvex lens converges the light beams while a concave lens diverges it. Chapter 10.indd 165 6/28/2025 6:02:56 PM Keep the curiosity alive 1. A light ray is incident on a mirror and gets reflected by it (Fig. 10.21). The angle made by the incident ray with the normal to the mirror is 40 . What is the angle made by the reflected ray with the mirror? (i) 40 (ii) 50 (iii) 45 (iv) 60 Pig. 10.21 2. Fig. 10.22 shows three different situations where a light ray falls on a mirror: (i) The light ray falls along the normal. (ii) The mirror is tilted, but the light ray still falls along the normal to the tilted surface. (iii) The mirror is tilted, and the light ray falls at an angle of 20 from the normal. Draw the reflected ray in each (c) case (Use a ruler and protractor for accurate drawing). What is the angle of reflection in each case? Incident ray Incident ray Mirror (a) Fig. 10.22 3.
