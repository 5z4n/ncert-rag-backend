seen in Fig. 11.5a, on the New Moon day, the Moon appears closest to the Sun and it appears farthest on the Full Moon day. Is this not what we also observed in Activity 11.1?

Moon overhead about 50 minutes later than today, when the Earth has rotated some more. Fig. 11.6: The Moon takes about 50 minutes longer to come back to nearly the same position in the sky. A step further The Moon phases do not happen due to Earth s shadow. It is an incorrect explanation for the Moon s phases that Earth s shadow falls on it. As we have learnt, the phases of the Moon
