and is called the mean solar day. The highest position of the Sun in the sky can be found by measuring the length of the shadows cast by an object during the day. The shadow is shortest when the Sun is at the highest point in the sky. | Activity 11.3: Let us measure a day! e Find a small flat area in a ground which receives sunlight during the day. Fix a 1 m stick vertically in it as shown in Fig. 11.7. e Start observing at 11:00 a.m. Every minute, mark a dot on the ground at the tip of the stick s shadow. Keep marking dots until around 1:10 p.m. e Identify when the shadow was shortest and find out its time by counting the number of dots. Record this time in Table 11.2. Repeat this exercise for the next few days. e Find the duration of the solar day by finding a difference in time on two consecutive days as shown in Fig. 11.7: Observing the length of the shadow Table 11.1 at different times during the day. uriosity Textbook of Science for Grade 8 A \ \ R \ R \ R \\ \ \\ \ \ Chapter 1l.indd 178 6/28/2025 6:05:36 PM \ . \ , \ \ \ F \ kp \ | \ [ Chapter 11 Keeping Time with the ses) 179 Table 11.2: Finding the duration of a solar day Chapter 1l.indd 179 Time of shortest shadow Date (hh:mm) 22 March 2025 12:20 23 March 2025 12:20 24 March 2025 12:19 Duration of day (hh:mm) 24:00 23:59 Find the average duration of the day. Is it nearly equal to 24 hours? The phases of the Moon give us another natural cycle with a duration that is longer than a day. The Moon takes about 29.5 days (nearly a month) to cycle through all its phases. The cycle of the phases of the Moon is the basis for a month, another unit to measure time (Fig. 11.8). The next larger unit to measure time is related to the natural cycle of seasons. Do you remember learning earlier that the Earth revolves around the Sun and takes nearly 365 and a quarter days to complete one revolution around the Sun? The Earth undergoes one cycle of seasons during this time, which can be used to define a solar year (Fig. 11.8). 11.2.1 Lunar calendars Cycle of Moon s phases due to its revolution around the Earth defines amonth Cycle of Earth s seasons due to its revolution around the Sun define Cycle of Sun returning to its highest position in the sky due to Earth s rotation defines a day Fig. 11.8: The Earth goes around the Sun, and the Moon revolves around the Earth in regular intervals of time. In ancient times, people had noticed that during one cycle of seasons, one can fit nearly 12 cycles of the phases of the moon, that is, 12 lunar months. This is how lunar
