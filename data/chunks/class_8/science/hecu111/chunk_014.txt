sky watching activity like we have done previously. Just before sunrise or after sunset, go to a location, accompanied by an adult, that has a clear view of the sky, without any obstruction of trees or tall buildings. Chapter 1l.indd 185 6/28/2025 6:06:36 PM e To identify satellites in the sky, look for any moving object in the sky that appears as a point of light with steady or flickering brightness and is moving very fast across the sky. You can see them with the naked eye or with binoculars. e You may use mobile apps or websites that provide details of satellites visible in your location and when they will be passing above you in the sky. A step further A lot of artificial satellites are being sent up in space by many countries. After their useful life, many of them and their rocket and could collide with working satellites. While small debris burns up in the atmosphere when it falls towards the Earth, the larger _ pieces can crash on ground. Countries are now working together to remove this dangerous debris. Vikram Ambalal Sarabhai (1919-1971) Vikram Sarabhai, a researcher in space science and nuclear physics is known as the Father of the Indian ao \ ips ai, Space programme. He pioneered the effort to launch abo the first artificial satellites. The Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), located in Thiruvananthapuram, the ISRO centre that develops rockets and launch vehicle technology, is named after him. Snapshots The illuminated part of the Moon changes its shape from day to day through phases, like the new Moon, crescent, and full Moon. The phases of the Moon happen because we see different parts of the illuminated portion of the Moon as it moves around the Earth. A full cycle of phases of the Moon takes about a month. @ The various cycles observed in nature resulted in the creation of calendars. Lunar calendars follow the Moon s cycle, while solar calendars follow the cycle of seasons, which depend upon the position of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun. Luni-solar calendars adapt to both the cycles. Artificial satellites are human-made which are launched from the Earth. They provide important information for our well-being and space-science studies. uriosity Textbook of Science for Grade 8 A \ | R \\ \ \ \ \ , I\ \ | Chapter 1l.indd 186 6/28/2025 6:06:45 PM Chapter 1l.indd 187 \ . \ , \ \ \ F \ kp \ | \ [ Chapter 11 Keeping Time with the ses) C Keep the curiosity alive 1.

(ii) The shadow of Earth blocks sunlight from reaching the Moon causing phases. (iii) Calendars are based on various astronomical cycles which repeat in a predictable manner. (iv) The Moon can only be seen at night. 2. Amol was born on 6th of May on a
