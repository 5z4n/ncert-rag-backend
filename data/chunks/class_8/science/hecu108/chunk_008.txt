you have two samples Sample A and Sample B (Fig. 8.16a and 8.16b). Compare both the Samples A and B step by step and record your observations in Table 8.2. Sample B (b) Fig. 8.15: (a) Heating Sample A; (b) Black mass (a) Fig. 8.16: (a) Sample A; (b) Sample B Step 1 Appearance e Compare the appearance of Sample A and Sample B like colour and texture.

Can we separate the components of Samples A and B? On adding dilute hydrochloric acid, do gases evolve in both Samples A and B? In both the cases, do the gases smell the same or different? e Also, categorise the substances used in this activity into mixtures, compounds, and elements. Sample A: We can say that Sample A is a mixture of the two elements iron and sulfur. Its components retain their properties, and their black and yellow coloured particles can be seen. On bringing magnet near Sample A, the iron filings get attracted towards the magnet. Hence, iron and sulfur can be separated. You might have observed that in Sample A, iron in the mixture reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid to form iron chloride and hydrogen gas. The gas is colourless, has no smell, and burns with a pop sound.
