measuring cylinder, and 5 mL in a 500 mL measuring cylinder. Suppose we want to take 70 mL of water. If we use a 50 mL measuring cylinder, it would not be possible to measure 70 mL of water in one step. First, we have to measure 50 mL water and then 20 mL. Measuring volume in more than one step is not convenient. On the other hand, if a 250 mL or 500 mL measuring cylinder is used, the measurement can be done in one step but the accuracy would be reduced as the smallest volume that these measuring cylinders can measure is greater than that of a 100 mL measuring cylinder. Hence, a 100 mL measuring cylinder is the best choice for this measurement. | Activity 9.5: Let us measure 50 mL of water e Place a clean, dry measuring cylinder on a flat surface. e Pour water slowly into the measuring cylinder up to the required mark, as shown in Fig. 9.17. e If required, adjust the level of water in the measuring cylinder by adding or removing a small amount of water using a dropper. e On careful observation, you will notice that the water inside the measuring cylinder forms a curved surface. This curved surface is called the meniscus (Fig. 9.18). e Read the mark on the measuring cylinder that coincides with the bottom of the meniscus for water or other colourless liquids. uriosity Textbook of Science for crade 8 @o@e@@e@e0e0e00 6/28/2025 5:06:14 PM Chapter 9.indd 145 ome me mm | (chapter 9 The Amazing World of Solutes, Solvents, and Solutions) 145 e Make sure that the eyes are at level with the bottom of the meniscus while noting the readings as shown in Fig. 9.18. Meniscus Fig. 9.17: Pouring water into Fig. 9.18: Measuring the reading the measuring cylinder e Once it reaches the required level that is, 50 mL transfer this water to the required container. I wonder how the level of a coloured liquid is measured? In case of coloured liquids the mark on the measuring cylinder should coincide with the top of the meniscus! Determining volume of solid objects with regular shapes | Activity 9.6: Let us calculate e Collect various objects with a cuboid shapes, such as a notebook, a shoe box, or a dice. e Measure the length (J), width (w), and height (h) of the objects using a scale. Suppose the length of the notebook is 25 cm, the width is 18 cm, and the height is 2 cm. e Calculate the volume by using the following formula. Volume=I[xwxh Volume = 25 cm x 18 cm x 2 cm = 900 cm? e Record in your notebook. Determining volume of objects with irregular shapes Imagine you have an object, like a stone, that does not have a regular shape. To calculate its density, the main challenge is to find its volume. Let us learn how the volume of a solid with an irregular shape can be determined. 6/28/2025
