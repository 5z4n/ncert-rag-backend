Determining volume of objects with irregular shapes Imagine you have an object, like a stone, that does not have a regular shape. To calculate its density, the main challenge is to find its volume. Let us learn how the volume of a solid with an irregular shape can be determined. 6/28/2025 5:06:18 PM Activity 9.7: Let us measure e Collect various objects from your surroundings, such as a stone, metal keys, and so on. e Fill a measuring cylinder with water up to any desired volume, say 50 mL (Fig. 9.19a) and record the initial volume taken in Table 9.2. e Tie the object, say a stone, with a thread and slowly lower it into the measuring cylinder. e What do you notice? e Record the final volume after the level rises, say 55 mL, as shown in Fig. 9.19b. e Subtract the initial volume from the final volume after the Fig. 9.19: Level of object is put into the measuring cylinder. This is the volume water in the measuring of the object. lind Without . . object: oo with object e Record your observations in Table 9.2.

We have already learnt to measure the mass and volume of liquids and solids of different types. These quantities can be used to calculate the density of the object or the substance. Let us calculate the density Density can be calculated using the following formula: .

Did you know that our planet, Earth, is composed of several layers, such as crust, upper mantle, lower mantle, outer core, and inner core, each with its particular range of density? The outermost layer, called the crust, is the lightest and the density of the different layers increases aS we move towards the centre (Fig. 9.20). As one moves deeper into the Inner core (solid) Earth, both the pressure and the temperature Fig. 9.20: Layers of Earth rise significantly, making the materials heavier and more compact.
