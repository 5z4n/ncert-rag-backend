liquids is a measuring cylinder. It is a narrow transparent cylindrical container with one side open and the other side closed as shown in Fig. 9.15. There are markings on the transparent body of the cylinder that indicate the volume of liquid in the measuring cylinder. We can use it to measure the desired amount of a liquid. Measuring cylinders are available in different sizes to measure volume 5 mL, 10 mL, 25 mL, 50 mL, 100 mL, 250 mL, etc (Fig. 9.15). How accurately can these measuring cylinders measure? Fig. 9.15: Measuring cylinders of different Let us find out! capacities | Activity 9.4: Let us observe and calculate In Curiosity, Grade 6, chapter Temperature and Its Measurement , you learnt how to use the thermometer and to find its smallest reading; you can do the same with a measuring cylinder. Take a measuring cylinder and observe it carefully. Note down the following: e What is the maximum volume it can measure? Now look at the measuring cylinder (Fig. 9.16) carefully. The cylinder is marked as 100 mL; therefore, it can measure volume up to 100 mL. What is the smallest volume it can measure? Look at the measuring cylinder again. e How much is the volume difference indicated between the two bigger marks (for example, between 10 mL and 20 mL)?

That is, the smallest value that this measuring cylinder can read is 1 mL. The smallest volume that a measuring cylinder can measure depends on the capacity of the measuring cylinder. Usually it is 0.1 mL in smaller measuring cylinders with a capacity of 10 mL or 25 mL, it is 1 mL in a 100 mL measuring cylinder, 2 mL ina 250 mL measuring cylinder, and 5 mL in a 500 mL measuring cylinder. Suppose we want to take 70 mL of water. If we use a 50 mL measuring cylinder, it would not be possible to measure 70 mL of water in one step. First, we have to measure 50 mL water and then 20 mL. Measuring volume in more than one step is not convenient. On the other hand, if a 250 mL or 500 mL measuring cylinder is used, the
