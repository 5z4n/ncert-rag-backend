clouds. Collision of electric charges within a clouds, or between clouds, or between a cloud and the ground causes lightning. Lightning strikes can cause destruction to life and property. Lightning conductors protect buildings from the effects of lightning. @ The India Meteorological Department (IMD) constantly monitors cyclones and thunderstorms in India. Keep the curiosity alive 1. Choose the correct statement. (i) Look at Fig. 6.21 carefully. Vessel R is filled with water. When pouring of water is stopped, the level of water will be (a) the highest in vessel P (b) the highest in vessel Q (c) the highest in vessel R (d) equal in all three vessels Fig. 6.21 (ii) A rubber sucker (M) is pressed on a flat smooth surface and an identical sucker (N) is pressed on a rough surface: (a) Both M and N will stick to their surfaces. (b) Both M and N will not stick to their surfaces. (c) M will stick but N will not stick. (d) M will not stick but N will stick. uriosity Textbook of Science for crades }- hy hy h hy h h Chapter 6.indd 94 6/28/2025 4:00:38 PM Chapter 6.indd 95 h h hy h hy { chapter Pressure, Winds, Storms, and cyclones 9 (iii) Awatertankis placed on the roof ofa building ata height H . To get water with more pressure on the ground floor, one has to (a) increase the height H at which the tank is placed. (b) decrease the height H at which the tank is placed. (c) replace the tank with another tank of the same height that can hold more water. (d) replace the tank with another tank of the same height that can hold less water. (iv) Two vessels, A and B contain water up to the same level as shown in Fig. 6.22. P, and P, is = = the pressure at the bottom of the vessels. F, and F, is the force exerted by the water at the bottom of the vessels A and B. A B (a) P,=P,,F,=F BA B (b) P, = P,, F, <F, Fig. 6.22 (c) P,<P,, F, =F, (d)P,>P,,F,>F, 2. State whether the following statements are True [T] or False [F]. (i) Air flows from a region of higher pressure to a region of lower pressure.[ ] (ii) Liquids exert pressure only at the bottom ofa container.[ |] (iii) Weather is stormy at the eye ofacyclone.[ |] (iv) During a thunderstorm, it is safer to be ina car.[ |] 3. Fig. 6.23a shows a boy lying horizontally, and Fig. 6.23b shows the boy standing vertically ona loose sand bed. In which case does the boy sink more in sand? Give reasons. 4. An elephant stands on four feet. If the area covered by one foot is 0.25 m , calculate the pressure exerted by the elephant on the ground if its weight is 20000 N.
