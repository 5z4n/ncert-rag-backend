the different states of wax in the figure and match them with Fig. 7.16b showing the arrangement of particles. . Why does the water in the ocean taste salty, even though the salt is not visible? Explain. . Grains of rice and rice flour take the shape of the container when placed in different jars. Are they solids or liquids? Explain.

Explore what will happen? e Design and create simple models to represent particles of solids, liquids, and gases showing interparticle spacing using clay balls, beads, etc. e Pretend to be particles of solids, liquids, and gases, at different temperatures create and perform a role-play/ dance showing particles in motion. e Debateintheclass Gases can spread and fillallthe available space . Is this property of gases beneficial or harmful? A step further The tiny particles that make up all matter are atoms and molecules. For example, iron is made up of atoms of iron, and gold is made up of atoms of gold. Atoms of many elements like hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur are not able to exist independently. In such cases, a certain number of atoms of the same element combine to form a molecule. For example, two atoms of hydrogen combine and form a stable particle called a molecule of hydrogen. A water molecule is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. You will learn about atoms and molecules in higher grades. Chapter 7.indd 115 6/28/2025 2:53:51 PM
