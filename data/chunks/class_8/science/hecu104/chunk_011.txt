75, and 100. Connect them to the same cell one by one. Note the deflection in a magnetic compass placed in the same position in all the cases. Report your observations. Draw conclusion of the effect of number of turns of the coil on the strength of the electromagnet. e Take two thin nichrome wires of equal length and different thickness (approximately one of these wire thickness to be double of the other, say 0.3 mm and 0.6 mm). Connect them one by one in a circuit which has a switch and a cell, and allow the current to flow for 30 s in each case. Momentarily touch these wires. Which wire heats up more? Now repeat the same activity with two nichrome wires of same diameter but of different lengths. Prepare a brief report of your activity. e Try to make an electric cell using various fruits and vegetables. Also try with electrodes of different metals. Prepare a brief report. A step further Even when a battery stops working, it is not completely dead . It could still contain materials like acids, and metals like lead, cadmium, nickel, or lithium, which may cause fires, or be harmful for the environment if the battery is thrown in regular garbage. Further, many materials used in these batteries are valuable and could be recycled and reused. These days, there are many places with special e-waste recycling facilities, where used batteries can be disposed of. If you are not sure, ask your teacher. Recycling batteries is good for the planet and the people. 6/28/2025 3:51:48 PM
