- Organisms that cannot produce their own food and depend f on other organisms for their food are called consumers or Pros heterotrophs (hetero = other + troph= food). List the heterotrophs from Table 12.4. t . Organisms that eat only plants are called herbivores, such | PA \ as deer and hare. Those that eat only animals are carnivores, such as leopard. Organisms that eat both plants and animals are omnivores, such as crows, foxes, and mice. 12.5 Who Eats Whom? In Activity 12.5, we learn about the feeding relationship among organisms. How can we make linkages with the feeding relationship among organisms in a given ecosystem? y > | ED mi U Fig. 12.8: Food chain uriosity Textbook of Science for Grade 8 |e oe fe le Se oe Se Sle cle oe Se cle Chapter 12.indd 198 6/28/2025 6:09:50 PM oe ce Se ee cle Se Se Se oe ote oe] Chapter 12 How Nature Works in Hacmony 199 Activity 12.6: Let us link (relate) e Take an example of a grassland ecosystem. e Consider the following organisms that we can spot in a grassland ecosystem: grass, frog, hare, fox, grasshopper, snake, and eagle. e In Fig. 12.8, a relationship of who eats whom is shown among some of the organisms. e Draw the feeding relationships for the remaining organisms by adding arrows, similar to those in Fig. 12.8. In Fig 12.8, you can see that the grass is eaten by the hare and the hare is eaten by the fox. This is a representation of a food chain in a grassland ecosystem. Which is another food chain that can be drawn for the organisms given in this activity? One example may be as follows: Grass > Grasshopper > Frog ~> Snake > Eagle The interactions between biotic components based on feeding relationships can be represented in the form of a linear chain. A food chain is a simple sequence showing who eats whom in an ecosystem. One such example is given in Fig. 12.9. | Activity 12.7: Let us draw Fig. 12.10a represents a crop field with millets, mouse, and eagle. e Count the number of each type of organism in Fig. 12.10a. Fig. 12.9: Another food chain in a grassland e Make a table and set a number in the table against each of the organisms. e Arrange the numbers in the ascending order, consider the highest number at the base and the lowest at the top. e Place the mouse, millet, and eagle appropriately in Fig. 12.10b. e What figure do you get? It looks like a pyramid. Complete the pyramid in Fig. 12.10b. Each organism in a food chain has a specific position, called a trophic level (troph = food): e Producers (like green plants) are at Fig. 12.10: (a) Food chain of millet, mouse, the first trophic level. and eagle in a crop field Chapter 12.indd 199 6/28/2025 6:09:53 PM ae Sa e Herbivores (like hares and deer) are at the second
