Science, where such estimates are made frequently. 10? seconds - Time needed to make a cup of tea: 5-10 minutes =1.6 minutes (= 4 x 10-8 x 10 seconds). - Time for light to reach the Earth from the Sun: about 8 minutes (= 5 x 10? seconds). 10 seconds = 16.6 minutes 10* seconds = 2.7 hours \ minutes... These liars!! It never gets cooked before 10 They should approximate it as order of 10 seconds noodles that way whether it takes 120 seconds or 900 seconds, the claim will be true. - Satellites in low Earth orbits take between 90 minutes (= 5.5 x 10 seconds) to 2 hours to complete one full revolution around the Earth. - The time needed to digest a meal: about 2-4 hours to pass through the stomach. - Lifespan of an adult mayfly: about a day (= 9 x 10* seconds). 2 10 seconds = 1.16 days and 10 seconds = 11.57 days. Think of some events or phenomena whose time is of the order of (i) 10 seconds and (ii) 10 seconds. Write them in scientific notation. 10 seconds = 115.7 days / = 3.8 months 10 seconds = 3.17 years 10 seconds = 31.7 years Time spent sleeping in a year: about 4 months. Time taken by Mangalyaan mission to reach Mars: 298 days (= 2.65 x 10 seconds). Le Time taken by Mars for one full revolution around the Sun: 687 Earth-days/1.88 Earth-years (= 6 x 10 seconds). The typical lifespan of most dogs is 3 to 15 years. The orbital period of Halley s comet is 75-79 years; the next expected return is in the year 2061 (= 2.4 x 10 seconds). Duration of one full revolution of Neptune around the Sun: 60,190 Earth-days/~165 Earth-years or 89,666 Neptunian days/1 Neptunian-year (= 5.2 x 10 seconds). A day on Neptune is about 16.1 hours Power Play Notice how rapid exponential growth is 10 seconds is less than a fortnight, but 10 seconds is a whopping 31 years (about half the life expectancy of a human)! 10' seconds - The Chola dynasty ruled for more than 900 years = 317 years (= 3 x 10 seconds) between the 3rd Century BCE and 12th Century CE. 10"'seconds - Age of the oldest known living tree: about 5000 years = 3,170 years (= 1.57 x 10'' seconds). - Time since the last peak ice age: 19,000 26,000 years ago (= 6 x 10" seconds 8.2 x 10"' seconds). 10 seconds - Early Homo sapiens first appeared 2-3 lakh years ago = 31,700 (=7 x 10'7- 9 x 10 seconds). The entire population years around that time could fit in a large cricket stadium. 10% seconds - The Steppe Mammoth is = 3.17 lakh estimated to have years appeared around 8-18 lakh years ago. 10 seconds - A fossil of Kelenken Guillermoi, = 3.17 million a type of terror bird, is dated years to 15 million years ago (= seconds). 10 seconds -
