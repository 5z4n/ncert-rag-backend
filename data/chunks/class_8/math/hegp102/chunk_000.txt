Take a sheet of paper, as large a sheet as you can find. Fold it once. Fold it again, and again. (2) How many times can you fold it over and over? Estu says I heard that a sheet of paper can t be folded more than 7 times . Roxie replies What if we use a thinner paper, like a newspaper or a tissue paper? Try it with different types of paper and see what happens. What! That s crazy! Just 46 times!? You must have ignored several zeros If you can fold a paper 46 times, it will be so | / thick that it can reach f| Well, why { don t you find -\ out yourselves. Say you can fold a sheet of paper as many times as you wish. What would its thickness be after 30 folds? Make a guess. Let us find out how thick a sheet of paper will be after 46 folds. Assume that the thickness of the sheet is 0.001 cm. wa a {).).))).)) )) Das Da a at and dead ead dead dead dead do 7/10/2025 3:29:53 PM (?) The following table lists the thickness after each fold. Observe that the thickness doubles after each fold.

After 10 folds, the thickness is just above 1 cm (1.024 cm). After 17 folds, the thickness is about 131 cm (a little more than 4 feet). _@ Now, what do you think the thickness would be after 30 folds? ( ath : 45 folds? Make a guess. Talk Daa (?)

The deepest point discovered in the oceans is the Mariana Trench, with a depth of 11 km. re Fold Thickness Fold Thickness Fold Thickness Chapter 2.indd 20 7/10/2025 3:29:55 PM Power Play | It might be hard to digest the fact that after just 46 folds, the thickness is more than 7,00,000 km. This is the power of multiplicative growth, also called exponential growth. Let us analyse the growth. We have seen that the thickness doubles after every fold. Fold 4 0.016
