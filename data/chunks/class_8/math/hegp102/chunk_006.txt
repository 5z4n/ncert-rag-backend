three times may be written as, 24s 23 = 252622 2 = 21=2 units. From this we can see that 94+ 93=94-3= 921. 2 What is 2' = 2* in powers of 2? In a generalised form, ni+n=n-?, where n + 0 anda and DP are counting numbers and a > b. * Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 an , (?) Why can t n be 0? Math = Talk We have not covered the case when the exponent is 0; for example, what is 2 ? Let us define 2 in a way that the generalised form above holds true. 0 94-494. 94_2X2xX2x2_ 2 =2 =2 + 2 = a2 9x 9x a1. In fact for any letter number a 2 = 27 4=2%=2%=1. In general, x*+ x*= x*-*= x? and so 1=x , where x # 0 and ais a counting number. When Zero is in Power! When a line of length 2* units is halved 5 times, 94.95 2x2x2x2 1 . Txgx2x2x2~ 2 units. Using the generalised form, we get 2*+ 2 = 2 -9 = 271, So, 212. When a line of length 2* units is halved 10 times, we get 2*= 21 = 2 -19 = 2 units. 4. 910 _ 2x2x2x2 ~ 1 _1 When expanded, 2 = 2 = Qyguaxdx2x2x2Xxaxaxn ~ W = Oh which is also written as 2 . 1 1 -3 = 1 2= 1 Similarly, 10 10 7 az, etc. (?) Can we write 10 = va ? We can write, 1 1 Io? = aot = 1+ Gyr = 1*10*= 10". Lo. 1 1 Similarly, 7 = zz and 4 = Fa. In a generalised form, a2, 1 1 Math n*= ; and n*= z , where n + 0. Talk Consider the following general forms we have identified. 2 We had required a and b to be counting numbers. Can a and b be any integers? Will the generalised forms still hold true? 2 Write equivalent forms of the following. (i) 2 (ii) 10 (iii) (- 7)* (iv) (5) (v) 10 2 Simplify and write the answers in exponential form. (i) 2*x2 (ii) 32x 3 x 3 (iii) p>x p* (iv) 24x (-4) (v) 8 x 8!

Yes, since 4 + 4 = 4 . (?) How many times larger than 4 is 4 ? 2 Use the power line for 7 to answer the following questions. 77 823543 2,401 x 49 = 76 117649 493 = 7 16807 x = 1: 2401 343 x 2,401
