point discovered in the oceans is the Mariana Trench, with a depth of 11 km. re Fold Thickness Fold Thickness Fold Thickness Chapter 2.indd 20 7/10/2025 3:29:55 PM Power Play | It might be hard to digest the fact that after just 46 folds, the thickness is more than 7,00,000 km. This is the power of multiplicative growth, also called exponential growth. Let us analyse the growth. We have seen that the thickness doubles after every fold. Fold 4 0.016 cm Fold 9 0.512 cm Fold 5 0.032 cm Fold 10 1.024 cm Notice the change in thickness after two folds. By how much does it increase? Hal. ORK After any 3 folds, the thickness increases 8 | Fold 6 0.064 cm times (= 2 x 2 x 2). Check if that is true. Similarly, from any point, the thickness after 10 folds increases by 1024 times (= 2 multiplied by itself 10 times), as shown in the table below. 0 to 10 1.024 cm 0.001 cm 1.024 + 0.001 = 1.023 cm = 1024 10 to 20 10.485 m 1.024 cm 10.485 m + 1.024 cm = 10.474m = 1024 20 to 30 10.737 km 10.485 m 10.737 km + 10.485 m = 10.726 km = 1024 30 to 40 10995 km - 10.737 km 10995 km + = 10984.2 km 10.737 km = 1024 2.2 Exponential Notation and Operations The initial thickness of the paper was 0.001 cm. Upon folding once, its thickness became 0.001 cm x 2 = 0.002 cm. Folding it twice, its thickness became 0.001 cm x 2 x 2 = 0.004 cm, or 0.001 cm x 2? = 0.004 cm (in shorthand). Upon folding it thrice, its thickness became 0.001 cm x 2 x 2 x 2, or 0.001 cm x 2 = 0.008 cm. When folded four times, its thickness became 0.001 cm x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2, or 0.001 cm x 2* = 0.016 cm. Similarly, the expression for the thickness of the paper when folded 7 times will be 0.001 cm x 2x 2x2 x2x2x2~x2,or0.001 cm x 2 =0.128 cm. We have seen that square numbers can be expressed as n and cube numbers as n . nx n=n (read as n squared or n raised to the power 2 ) ae Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 nxnxn=n (read as n cubed or n raised to the power 3 ) nxnxnxn=n' (read as n raised to the power 4 or the 4th power of n ) nxnxnxnxnxnxn=M (read as n raised to the power 7 or the 7th power of n ) and so on. In general, we write n to denote n multiplied by itself a times. 54=5x5x5x5=625. 5* is the exponential form of 625. Here, 4 is the exponent/power, and 5 is the base. Exponents of the form 5" are called powers of 5: 5 , 5 , 5 , 54, etc. 2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2= 2" = 1024. Remember the 1024 from earlier? There, it meant that after
