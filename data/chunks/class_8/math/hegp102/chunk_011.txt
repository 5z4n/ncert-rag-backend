sages, and scholars walked thousands of kilometres to different parts of the world across deserts, mountains, and rivers. How many times can a person circumnavigate (go around the world) the Earth in their lifetime if they walk non-stop? Consider the distance around the Earth as 40,000 km. Linear Growth vs. Exponential Growth Roxie tells Estu about a science-fiction novel she is reading where they build a ladder to reach the moon, ... I wonder if we actually had a ladder like that, how many steps would it have? . an instinctive guess first. Would the number of steps be in thousands, lakhs, crores, or even more? To find out, we would need to know the gap between consecutive steps of the ladder. Let s assume a reasonable distance of 20 cm. Visualising the problem as shown, ~*~ Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 tath Moon PLT TAT ees ' \ 120m k< 5, 84,40 km (?) We have to find out how many 20 cm make 3,84,400 km. If we calculate the value, we get the result as 1,92,20,00,000 steps, which is 192 crore and 20 lakh steps or 1 billion 922 million steps. The fixed increase in the distance from the earth with each step (a 20 cm gain after each step) is called linear growth. To cover the distance between the Earth and the Moon, it takes 1,92,20,00,000 steps with linear growth whereas it takes just 46 folds of a piece of paper with exponential growth! Linear growth is additive, whereas exponential growth is multiplicative. 20+ 20+ 20+... 0.001 x2x2* 2... 1,92,20,00,000 46 times times Some examples of exponential growth we have seen earlier in this chapter are The Stones that Shine , Magical Pond , How Many Combinations . We shall explore more such interesting examples in a later chapter and also in the next grade. 2 Can you come up with some examples of linear growth and of exponential growth? Getting a Sense for Large Numbers Last year, we learnt about lakhs and crores, as well as millions and billions. A lakh is 10 (1,00,000), a crore is 10 (1,00,00,000), and an arab is 10 (1,00,00,00,000), whereas a million is 10 (1,000,000) and a billion is 10 (1,000,000,000). You might know the size of the world s human population. Have you ever wondered how many ants there might be in the world or how long ago humans emerged? In this section, we shall explore numbers significantly larger than arabs and billions. We shall use powers of 10 to represent and compare these numbers in each case. 10 . As of mid-2025, there are only two northern white rhinos remaining in the world, both females, and they reside at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya (= 2 x 10 ). 10 10* LIBERIA 10 10 = 5 Power Play ~ As of early 2024, the total population of Hainan gibbons is a meagre 42 (= 4x 10 ). There are just 242 Kakapo alive as of mid-2025 (=
