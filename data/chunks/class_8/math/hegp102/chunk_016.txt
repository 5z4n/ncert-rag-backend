Gautama, the Bodhisattva. Hundred kotis are called an ayuta (10 ), hundred ayutas a niyuta (10"), hundred niyutas a kankara (10 ), .... hundred sarva-balas a visamjnagati (10* ), hundred visamjna-gatis a sarvajna (10), hundred sarvajnas a vibhutangama (10 '), a hundred vibhutangamas is a tallakshana (10 ).

An anonymous Jaina treatise Amalasiddhi gives a list with a name for each power of ten up to 10 (dasha-ananta). A Pali grammar treatise of Kdccdyana lists number-names up to 10 , named asankhyeya. PowerPlay ~~ For expressing high powers of ten, Jaina and Buddhist texts use bases like sahassa (thousand) and kofti (ten million); for instance, prayuta (10 ) would be dasa sata sahassa (ten hundred thousand). The modern naming is similar to this, where we say, A hundred 100 x 1000 = 1,00,000 10% x 10 = 10 thousand is a lakh A hundred lakhs 100 x 1,00,000 = 1,00,00,000 10? x 10 = 10 is a crore Ahundred crores 100 x 1,00,00,000 = 1,00,00,00,000 10% 10 =10 is an arab A hundred arab is 100 x 1,00,00,00,000 10? x 10 = 107" a kharab = 1,00,00,00,00,000 Continuing this, a hundred kharab is a neel (10" ), a hundred neel is a padma (10 ), a hundred padma is a shankh (10" ) and a hundred shankh is a maha shankh (10"). In the American/International system, we say A thousand thousand 1000 x 1000 = 1,000,000 10 x 10 = 10 is a million A thousand million is 1000 x 1,000,000 = 1,000,000,000 10 x 10 = 10 a billion A thousand billion is 1000 x 1,000,000,000 10? x 10 = 10 an trillion = 1,00,000,000,000 Continuing this, a thousand trillion is a quadrillion (10 ). This pattern continues. Observe the names million (10 ), billion (10 ), trillion (10 ), quadrillion (10), quintillion (10'*), sextillion (107), septillion (10%), octillion (107 ), nonillion (10 ), decillion (10 ). 2 What does the first part of each name denote?

The currency note with the highest denomination in India currently is 2000 rupees. Guess what is the highest denomination of a currency note ever, across the world.
