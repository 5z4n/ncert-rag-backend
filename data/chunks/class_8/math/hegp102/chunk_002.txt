as n raised to the power 7 or the 7th power of n ) and so on. In general, we write n to denote n multiplied by itself a times. 54=5x5x5x5=625. 5* is the exponential form of 625. Here, 4 is the exponent/power, and 5 is the base. Exponents of the form 5" are called powers of 5: 5 , 5 , 5 , 54, etc. 2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2= 2" = 1024. Remember the 1024 from earlier? There, it meant that after every 10 folds, the thickness increased 1024 times. 5*is read as 5 raised to the power 4 or 5 to the power 4 or 5 power 4 or Ath power of 5 Which expression describes the thickness of a sheet of paper after it is folded 10 times? The initial thickness is represented by the letter-number v. (i) 10v (ii) 10 +v (iii) 2x 10xv (iv) 2" (v) 2' v (vi) 10 v Some more examples of exponential notation: 4x4x4=4 = 64, (- 4) x (4) x (-4)=(- 4) =- 64. Similarly, axaxaxbxbcan be expressed as a*b (read as a cubed b squared). axaxbxbxbxbcan be expressed as a b* (read as a squared b raised to the power 4). Remember that 4+4+4=3x4=12, whereas 4 x 4x 4 = 43 = 64. 2 Express the number 32400 as a product of its prime factors and represent the prime factors in their exponential form. 32400 =2x2x2x2x5x5x3x3x3x3. In exponential form, this would be 32400 = 2? 5*x 3%, 2 {32400 2 What is ( 1) ? Is it positive or negative? What about (- 1) ? 2 Is ( 2)* = 16? Verify. What is 02, 0 ? What is 0"? @ Figure it Out 1. Express the following in exponential form: (i) 6x6x6x6 (ii) yxy (iii) bxbxbxb (iv) 5x5x7x7x7 (v) 2x2xaxa (vl) axaxaxcxcxcxcxd (?) How many rooms were there altogether? Power Play 2. Express each of the following as a product of powers of their prime factors in exponential form. (i) 648 (ii) 405 (iii) 540 (iv) 3600 3. Write the numerical value of each of the following: (i) 2x 10 (ii) 7 x 2 (iii) 3.x 4* (iv) ( 3) x( 5) (v) 3 x10* (vi) (2) x (-10) The Stones that Shine ... Three daughters with curious eyes, Each got three baskets a kingly prize. Each basket had three silver keys, Each opens three big rooms with ease. Each room had tables one, two, three, With three bright necklaces on each, you see. Each necklace had three diamonds so fine... Can you count these stones that shine? Hint: Find out the number of baskets and rooms. The information given can be visualised as shown below. From the diagram, the number of rooms is 3*. This can be computed by repeatedly multiplying 3 by itself, 3x3=9. 9x 3 = 27. 27x 3=81. 81 x 3 = 243. (?) How many diamonds were there in total? Can we find out by just one multiplication using the products above? The number of diamonds
