Homo sapiens first appeared 2-3 lakh years ago = 31,700 (=7 x 10'7- 9 x 10 seconds). The entire population years around that time could fit in a large cricket stadium. 10% seconds - The Steppe Mammoth is = 3.17 lakh estimated to have years appeared around 8-18 lakh years ago. 10 seconds - A fossil of Kelenken Guillermoi, = 3.17 million a type of terror bird, is dated years to 15 million years ago (= seconds). 10 seconds - Age of Himalayas: 5.5 crore years/55 million years (= 1.7 = 3.17 crore x 10 seconds); they continue to grow a few mm every years year. - Dinosaurs went extinct 6.6 crore years ago/66 million years ago (= 2 x 10" seconds). - Dinosaurs first appeared more than 20 crore/200 million years ago (= 6 x 10 seconds). - It takes about 23 crore years for the Sun to make one complete trip around the Milky Way (= 7 x 10 seconds). 10' seconds - Plants on land started 47 crore/470 million years = 31.7 crore years ago (= seconds). 10 seconds The oldest fossil evidence suggests that bacteria = 3.17 billion years first appeared about 3.7 billion years ago. - The Earth is 4.5 billion years old. - The Milky Way galaxy was formed 13.6 billion years ago, and the Universe was formed 13.8 billion years ago. Notice that 10 seconds is of the order of the lifespan of a human, whereas 10** seconds ago the universe did not exist according to modern physics!! The exponential notation can capture very large quantities in a concise manner. 2 Calculate and write the answer using scientific notation: (i) If one star is counted every second, how long would it take to count all the stars in the universe? Answer in terms of the number of seconds using scientific notation. (ii) If one could drink a glass of water (200 ml) every 10 seconds, how long would it take to finish the entire volume of water ez on Earth? Very large quantities are often beyond our experience and comprehension. To put them into perspective, we can relate and compare them with quantities we are familiar with. This can give an essence of how large a number or a measure is! 2.5 A Pinch of History In the Lalitavistara, a Buddhist treatise from the first century BCE, we see number-names for odd powers of ten up to 10 . The following occurs as part of the dialogue between the mathematician Arjuna and Prince Gautama, the Bodhisattva. Hundred kotis are called an ayuta (10 ), hundred ayutas a niyuta (10"), hundred niyutas a kankara (10 ), .... hundred sarva-balas a visamjnagati (10* ), hundred visamjna-gatis a sarvajna (10), hundred sarvajnas a vibhutangama (10 '), a hundred vibhutangamas is a tallakshana (10 ). Mahaviracharya gives a list of 24 terms (i.e., up to 10 ) in his treatise Ganita-sara-sangraha. An anonymous Jaina treatise Amalasiddhi gives a list with a name for each power of ten
