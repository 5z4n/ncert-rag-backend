Can you count these stones that shine? Hint: Find out the number of baskets and rooms. The information given can be visualised as shown below. From the diagram, the number of rooms is 3*. This can be computed by repeatedly multiplying 3 by itself, 3x3=9. 9x 3 = 27. 27x 3=81. 81 x 3 = 243. (?) How many diamonds were there in total? Can we find out by just one multiplication using the products above? The number of diamonds is 3 x 3x 3x3x3x3x3=3'. Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 We can write 37=(3x3x3x 3)x (3x 3x3) We had computed till 3*. To find 3 , we can just multiply 3*(= 81) with 3 (= 27). = 3*x 3 3x3x3x3x3x3x3 = 81 x 27 = 2187 34 33 2 3 can also be written as 3 x 3 . Can you reason out why? This can be easily extended to products where exponents are the same letter-numbers. 2 Write the product p* x p in exponential form. p'x p = (px px px p) x (px px px p* pp) =p . We can generalise this to n x n= nn , where a and b are counting numbers. a, 2 Use this observation to compute the following. Ci (i) 2 (ii) 5 (iii) 4 Talk 4 can be evaluated in these two ways, (4x4x4)x(4x4x4)=44x 4 |(4x4)x(4x4)x(4x4)=4x 4x4 = 64 x 64 =16x16x 16 = 4096. = 4096. 4 x 4 is the square of 4 , i.e., 4 x 4 x 4? is the cube of 4 , ie., ; 43 x 4 can also be written as | 4 x 4 x 4 can also be written as (4 ). (43) . Similarly, 7* = (7 x 7) x (7 x 7) = 7? x 7 = (72), and 21 =(2 x 2) x (2 x 2) x (2 x 2) x (2 x 2) x (2 x 2) = (27) x (27) x (27) x (27) x (2) = (2?) . (?) Is 2" also equal to (25)? Write it as a product. 2 =(2x2x2x2x2)x(2x2x2x2x2) = (2 ) x (2 ) = (2 )?. In general, (n%) =(n )*= n** =n , where a and b are counting numbers. 2 Write the following expressions as a power of a power in at least two different ways: (i) 8 (ii) 7 (iii) 9** (iv) 5 Magical Pond 2 In the middle ofa beautiful, magical pond lies a bright pink lotus. The number of lotuses doubles every day in this pond. After 30 days, the pond is completely covered with lotuses. On which day was the pond half full? If the pond is completely covered by lotuses on the 30th day, how much of it is covered by lotuses on the 29th day? Since the number of lotuses doubles every day, the pond should be half covered on the 29th day. (?) Write the number of lotuses (in exponential form) when the pond was (i) fully covered (ii) half
