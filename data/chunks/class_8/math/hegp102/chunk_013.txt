x 10 ). The estimate of the earthworm population is also at 1 padma/1 quadrillion. 10 The estimated population of ants globally is 20 padma/20 quadrillion (2 x 10 ). Ants alone outweigh all wild birds and wild mammals combined. 10 is supposed to be the number of grains of sand on all beaches and deserts on Earth. This is enough sand to give every ant 10 little sand castles to live in. 10 The estimated number of stars in the observable universe is 2x10 . 10 There are an estimated 2 x 10 drops of water on Earth (assuming 16 drops per millilitre). 2 Calculate and write the answer using scientific notation: (i) How many ants are there for every human in the world? (ii) Ifa flock of starlings contains 10,000 birds, how many flocks could there be in the world? Power Play ~ (iii) Ifeach tree had about 10 leaves, find the total number of leaves on all the trees in the world. (iv) If you stacked sheets of paper on top of each other, how many would you need to reach the Moon? A different way to say your age! How old are you? asked Estu. I completed 13 years a few weeks ago! said Roxie. How old are you? asked Estu again. T m 4840 days old today! said Roxie. How old are you? asked Estu again. Tm hours old! said Roxie. Make an estimate before finding this number. Estu: I am 4070 days old today. Can you find out my date of birth? Tam 69,70,710 ... old What could this number mean? 2 If you have lived for a million seconds, how old would peng out! you be? We shall look at approximate times and timelines of some events and phenomena, and use powers of 10 to represent and compare these quantities. Time in seconds Comparison to real-world events/phenomena 10 = 1 second - Time taken for a ball thrown up to fall back on the ground (typically a few seconds). 10' = 10 seconds - Time blood takes to complete one full circulation through the body: 10-20 seconds (1 x 10' 2 x 10! seconds). - Typical waiting time at a traffic signal. Isn t it quite amazing how someone is able to estimate things ,. like the number of ants in the world or the time blood takes to fully circulate? You may carry this wonder whenever you encounter such facts. You will come across such facts in subjects like Science and Social Science, where such estimates are made frequently. 10? seconds - Time needed to make a cup of tea: 5-10 minutes =1.6 minutes (= 4 x 10-8 x 10 seconds). - Time for light to reach the Earth from the Sun: about 8 minutes (= 5 x 10? seconds). 10 seconds = 16.6 minutes 10* seconds = 2.7 hours \ minutes... These liars!! It never gets cooked before 10 They should approximate it as order of 10 seconds noodles that way
