(ii) 20 (ii) 10% (iii) 10* (iv) 10% (v) 2x10 (vi) 10 + 10 Calculate and write the answer in scientific notation: (i) If each person in the world had 30 pieces of clothing, find the total number of pieces of clothing. (ii) There are about 100 million bee colonies in the world. Find the number of honeybees if each colony has about 50,000 bees. (iii) The human body has about 38 trillion bacterial cells. Find the bacterial population residing in all humans in the world. (iv) Total time spent eating in a lifetime in seconds. What was the date 1 arab/1 billion seconds ago? m We analysed some situations, asked questions, and found answers by first guessing, then modelling the problem statement, followed by making assumptions and approximations to carry out the calculations. m We experienced how rapid exponential growth, also called multiplicative growth, can be compared to additive growth. m n isnxnxnxnx...xn(nmultiplied by itself a times) and n = a = Operations with exponents satisfy nex n= nw (n%) = (n )* =n? en?+n=n*?>(n#0) e n*x m*=(n x m)* e n =+m *=(n+m)*(m FO) n =1(n#0) = The scientific notation for the number 308100000 is 3.081 x 10 . The standard form of the scientific notation of any number is x x 10 , where x > 1 and x < 10, and y is an integer. = Engaging in interesting thought experiments can be used as means to understand how large a number or a quantity is. Find a partner to play this game with. In 10 seconds, the person who writes a number or an expression, using only the digits 0-9 and arithmetic operations, that gives a number that is the larger between the two wins the round. 40000000000000 999999 x 999099 In Round 1, Roxie wrote 10000000000000 and Estu wrote 999999 x 999999. Between these two, Roxie s number is greater. Can you see why? Roxie s number is 10* , whereas Estu s number is less than (10 ) . In Round 2, Roxie wrote 10 + 107 + 10 + 10 and Estu wrote (1010) x 9000. Can you say which is greater?
