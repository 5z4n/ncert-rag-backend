10 = 0.59 x 10000 = 0.59 x 10%. Any number can be written as the product of a number between 1 and 10 and a power of 10. For example, 5900 = 5.9 x 10 20800 = 2.08 x 10 80,00,000 = 8 x 10 2 Write the large-number facts we read just before in this form. In scientific notation or scientific form (also called standard form), we write numbers as x x 10 , where x > 1 and x < 10 is the coefficient and y, the exponent, is any integer. Often, the exponent y is more important than the coefficient x. When we write the 2 crore population of Mumbai as 2 x 10 , the 7 is more important than the 2. Indeed, if the 2 is changed to 3, the population increases by one-half, i.e., 2 crore to 3 crore, whereas if the 7 is changed to 8, the change in population is 10 times, i.e., 2 crores to 20 crores. Therefore, the standard form explicitly mentions the exponent, which indicates the number of digits. If we say that the population of Kohima is 1,42,395, then it gives the impression that we are quite sure about this number up to the units place. When we use large numbers, in most cases, we are more concerned about how big a quantity or measure is, rather than the exact value. If we are only sure that the population is around 1 lakh 42 thousand, we can write it as 1.42 x 10 . If we can only be certain that it is around 1 lakh 40 thousand, we write it as 1.4 x 10 . The number of digits in the coefficient reflects how well we know the number. The most important part of any Power Play = See oe ~*~ Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 number written in scientific form is the exponent, and then the first digit of the coefficient. The digits following the coefficient are small corrections to the first digit. ..wWhen I started working here, it was 70 million It is 70 million \ and 15 years old} How old is this dinosaur s skeleton? These values are rounded-off estimates, averages, or approximations; most of the time, they serve the purpose at hand. The distance between the Sun and Saturn is 14,33,50,00,00,000 m 1.4335 x 10 m. The distance between Saturn and Uranus is 14,39,00,00,00,000 m = 1.439 x 10% m. The distance between the Sun and Earth is 1,49,60,00,00,000 m = 1.496 x 10"! m. 2 Can you say which of the three distances is the smallest? (?) The number line below shows the distance between the Sun and Saturn (1.4335 x 10% m). On the number line below, mark the relative position of the Earth. The distance between the Sun and the Earth is 1.496 x 101! m. J Sun Saturn 2 Express the following numbers in standard form. (i) 59,853 (ii) 65,950 (iii) 34,30,000 (iv) 70,04,00,00,000 2.5 Did You
