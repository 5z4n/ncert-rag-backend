1 Power Play sai | ~ " " Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 2 Can we say that 16384 (4 ) is 16 (4 ) times larger than 1,024 (4 )? Yes, since 4 + 4 = 4 . (?) How many times larger than 4 is 4 ? 2 Use the power line for 7 to answer the following questions. 77 823543 2,401 x 49 = 76 117649 493 = 7 16807 x = 1: 2401 343 x 2,401 16,807 _ 7 7 = zl 7 343 1 16,807 _ 7 8,23,543 71 7 1 / 1,17,649 x 343 7 49 1 1 -X - = 73 1 343 : 343 4 1 7 2401 2.4 Powers of 10 We have used numbers like 10, 100, 1000, and so on when writing Indian numerals in an expanded form. For example, 47561 = (4 x 10000) + (7 x 1000) + (5 x 100) + (6 x 10) + 1. This can be written using powers of 10 as (4 x 10*) + (7 x 10 ) + (5 x 10 ) + (6 x 10') + (1 x 10 ). (2) write these numbers in the same way: (i) 172, (ii) 5642, (iii) 6374. (2) How can we write 561.903? _ lA 1. _1_ 561.903 = (5 x 100) + (6x 10)+1+(9~x 10) + (0 x 100) + (3 x 1000." Writing it using powers of 10, we have 561.903 = (5 x 102) + (6 x 10 ) + (1 x 10 ) + (9 x 10 ) + (0 x 107) + (3 x 10 ). Scientific Notation Let s look at some facts involving large numbers (i) The Sun is located 30,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,000 m from the centre of our Milky Way galaxy. (ii) The number of stars in our galaxy is 1,00,00,00,00,000. (iii) The mass of the Earth is 59,76,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,000 kg. As the number of digits increases, it becomes difficult to read the numbers correctly. We may miscount the number of zeroes or place commas incorrectly. We will then read the wrong value. It is like getting ~5,000 when you were supposed to get 50,000. The number of zeroes is more important than the initial digits in several cases. Can we use the exponential notation to simplify and read these very large numbers correctly? For example, the number 5900 can be expressed as 5900 = 590 x 10 = 590 x 10 = 59 x 100 = 59 x 10 = 5.9 x 1000 = 5.9 x 10 = 0.59 x 10000 = 0.59 x 10%. Any number can be written as the product of a number between 1 and 10 and a power of 10. For example, 5900 = 5.9 x 10 20800 = 2.08 x 10 80,00,000 = 8 x 10 2 Write the large-number facts we read just before in this form. In scientific notation or scientific form (also called standard form), we write numbers as x x 10 , where x > 1
