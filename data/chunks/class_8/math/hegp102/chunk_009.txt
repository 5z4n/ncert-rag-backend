On the number line below, mark the relative position of the Earth. The distance between the Sun and the Earth is 1.496 x 101! m. J Sun Saturn 2 Express the following numbers in standard form.

Let us continue this journey. Nanjundappa wants to donate jaggery equal to Roxie s weight and wheat equal to Estu s weight. He is wondering how much it would cost. SA da 2 What would be the worth (in rupees) of the donated jaggery? What would be the worth (in rupees) of the donated wheat? In order to find out, let us first describe the relationships among the quantities present. Worth of jaggery (in rupees) = Roxie s weight in kg cost of 1 kg jaggery. Worth of wheat (in rupees) = Estu s weight in kg x cost of 1 kg wheat. (?) Make necessary and reasonable assumptions for the unknowns and find the answers. Remember, Roxie is 13 years old and Estu is 11 years old. Assuming Roxie s weight to be 45 kg and the cost of 1 kg of jaggery to be ~70, the worth of donated jaggery is 45 x 70 = %3150. Assuming Estu s weight to be 50 kg and the cost of 1 kg of wheat to be 50, the worth of donated wheat is 50 x 50 = #2500. The practice of offering goods equal to the weight of a person, called Tulabhara or seer is quite old and is still followed in many places in Southe a token of gratitu ndia. It is a symbol of bhakti (surrendering oneself), ; it also supports the community. 2 Roxie wonders, Instead of jaggery if we use 1-rupee coins, how many coins are needed to equal my weight? . How can we find out? For questions like these, you can consider following the steps suggested below. 1. Guessing: Make an instinctive (quick) guess of what the answer could be, without any calculations. ~*~ Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 2. Calculating using estimation and approximation (i) Describe the relationships among the quantities that are needed to find the answer. (ii) Make reasonable assumptions and approximations if the required information is not available. (iii) Compute and find the answer (and check how close your guess was). Would the number of coins be in hundreds, thousands, lakhs, crores, or even more? Make an instinctive guess. (?) Find the answer by making necessary and reasonable assumptions and approximations for | How about measuring the unknowns. Remember, we are not looking for an exact answer but a reasonably close estimate. to find out the weight of a 1-rupee coin? Initially, your guesses
