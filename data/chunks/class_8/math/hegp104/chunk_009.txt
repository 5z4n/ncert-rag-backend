angles to be x. What are the other angles? Since ZP + ZR = 180 , ZR= 180- ZP = 180 -x. Similarly, since 7A + ZR = 180 , ZA=180- ZR= 180 - (180 x) = 180-180 + x=x. Thus, 7P = ZA =x. P E Similarly, we can deduce that 7 R= ZE= 180-x. Therefore, this shows that the opposite angles of a parallelogram are always equal. 2 Deduction 7 What can we say about the sides of a parallelogram? By looking at a parallelogram, it appears that the opposite sides are equal. Can we again use congruence to show this? Which two triangles can be considered for this? Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 In AABD and ACDB, the angles marked with a single arc are equal as they are the opposite angles of a parallelogram. Since AD | | BC,and BDisatransversal to it, the angles marked with double arcs are equal as they are alternate angles. A B So, by the AAS condition, the triangles are congruent, that is, AABD = ACDB. Therefore, AD = CB, and AB = CD. Thus, the opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal. (?) Is it wrong to write AABD = ACBD? Why? From these deductions we can find the remaining sides and angles of the parallelogram. Let us list the properties of a parallelogram. Property 1: The opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal. Property 2: The opposite sides of a parallelogram are parallel. Property 3: In a parallelogram, the adjacent angles add up to 180 , and the opposite angles are equal. 2 Are the diagonals of a parallelogram always equal? Check with the parallelogram that you have constructed. We see that the diagonals of a parallelogram need not be equal. 2 Do they bisect each other (do they intersect at their midpoints)? Reason and/or experiment to figure this out. Deduction 8 What is the point of intersection of the two diagonals in a parallelogram? As in the case of a rectangle, we can find out if the diagonals bisect each other by examining the congruence of AAOE and AYOS in the parallelogram EASY. Quadrilaterals S AE = YS (as they are the opposite sides of the parallelogram) The angles marked using a single arc are equal, and so are the angles marked using a double arc, since they are alternate angles of parallel lines. Thus, by the ASA condition, the triangles are congruent, that is, AAOE = AYOS. Therefore, OA = OY, and OE = OS, since they are corresponding parts of congruent triangles. Thus, O is the midpoint of both diagonals. (?) Is it wrong to write AAOE = ASOY? Why? Property 4: The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. 2 Do the diagonals of a parallelogram intersect at a particular angle? 4.4 Quadrilaterals with Equal Sidelengths 2 Are squares the only quadrilaterals that have equal sidelengths? Let us explore this question D through construction. Draw two equal sides AD and AB, that are not perpendicular
