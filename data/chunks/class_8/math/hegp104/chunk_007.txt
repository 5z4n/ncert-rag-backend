is the figure APML? Reason and/or experiment to figure this out. 4. We have seen how to get 90 using paper folding. Now, suppose /yj, he J we do not have any paper but two sticks of equal length, anda _ \ Talk thread. How do we make an exact 90 using these? sides are parallel. Can this be chosen as a definition of a rectangle? In other words, is every quadrilateral that has opposite sides parallel and equal, a rectangle? ; 5. Wesaw that one of the properties ofa rectangle is thatits opposite | ap 4.2 Angles in a Quadrilateral 2 Is it possible to construct a quadrilateral with three angles equal to 90 and the fourth angle not equal to 90 ? You might have observed through constructions that this may not be possible. 2 But why not? This is due to a general property of quadrilaterals related to their angles. We have seen that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 . There is a similar regularity in the sum of the angles of a quadrilateral. Consider a quadrilateral SOME. al Draw a diagonal SM. We get two S triangles ASEM and ASOM. 2 In ASEM, we have 41 + 22 + 23 = 180 . And in ASOM, 24 + 25 + 26 = 180 . What do we get when we add all six angles? We will have A\ Alt 22+ 23+ 24+ 25 + 26= 180" + 180 A (N = 360 . Or, (21+ 24) + (23 + 26) +22 + 25 = 360 . Since (41+ 24),(23+ 26), 72 and 45 are the angles ofthis quadrilateral, we have the following result The sum of all angles in any quadrilateral is 360 . This explains why it is impossible for a quadrilateral to have three right angles, with the fourth angle not right angle. E 4.3 More Quadrilaterals with Parallel Opposite Sides Rectangles (and therefore squares) have parallel opposite sides. 2 Are there quadrilaterals that have parallel opposite sides that are not rectangles? Let us try constructing one. This can be easily done by drawing two pairs of parallel lines, ensuring that they do not meet at right angles. 2 Construct such a figure by recalling how parallel lines can be constructed using a ruler and a set-square, or a compass and a ruler. Observe the quadrilateral ABCD. It has parallel opposite sides but is not a rectangle. Thus, a larger set of quadrilaterals exists in which the opposite sides are parallel. Such quadrilaterals are called parallelograms. Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 2 Is a rectangle a parallelogram? A rectangle has opposite sides parallel. So, it satisfies the parallelogram s definition. Hence, it is indeed a parallelogram. More specifically, a rectangle is a special kind of parallelogram with all its angles equal to 90 . Let us represent this relation using a Venn diagram. To understand the relations between the sides and the angles of a parallelogram, let us construct
