you able to construct such a quadrilateral? Let us prove why this is impossible. Deduction 4 What is the shape of a quadrilateral with all the angles equal to 90 ? (?) Consider a quadrilateral ABCD with all angles measuring 90 . What can we say about the opposite sides of such a quadrilateral? Join BD. ABAD and ADCB seem congruent. Can we justify this claim? B C Two equalities can be directly seen in the triangles. What can we say about 71 and 22? A D Recall that we tackled a very similar problem in Deduction 2. We can use the same reasoning here. B C Since 4B = 90 , In ABCD, since : 23+ Z1 = 90 . 23 + 22 + 90 = 180 , (39) oni 23+ 22 = 90 . Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 So, 71 = 22. Thus, by the AAS congruence condition, ABAD = ADCB. Therefore, AD = CB, and DC = BA, since these are corresponding sides of congruent triangles. (?) Is it wrong to write ABAD = ACDB? Why? Thus, we have established that if all the angles of a quadrilateral are right angles, then the opposite sides have equal lengths. Therefore, the quadrilateral is a rectangle. Thus, a rectangle can simply be defined as follows Rectangle: A rectangle is a quadrilateral in which the angles are all 90 . Let us list the properties of a rectangle. Property 1: All the angles of a rectangle are 90 . Property 2: The opposite sides of a rectangle are equal. 2 Are the opposite sides of a rectangle parallel? They definitely seem so. This fact can be justified using one of the transversal properties. Noticethat ABactsasatransversaltoAD 8 Cc and BC, and that 7A + 7B = 90 + 90 = 180 . When the sum of the internal angles on the same side of the transversal is 180 , the lines are parallel. We can use this fact to conclude that the lines AD and BC are parallel, which we represent as AD | | BC. Can you similarly show that AB is A parallel to DC (AB| | DC)? Property 3: The opposite sides of a rectangle are parallel to each other. Property 4: The diagonals of a rectangle are of equal length and they bisect each other. A Special Rectangle In the quadrilaterals below, are there any non-rectangles? 3.6 cm. 4cm 5 o sn 4 Q g cm 5 g 3 2 6 .

However, it is a special kind of rectangle with all sides of equal length. We know that this quadrilateral is also called a square. Square: A square is a quadrilateral in which all the angles are equal to 90 , and all the sides are of equal length.
