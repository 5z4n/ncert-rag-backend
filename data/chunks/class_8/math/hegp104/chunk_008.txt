are parallel. Such quadrilaterals are called parallelograms. Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 2 Is a rectangle a parallelogram? A rectangle has opposite sides parallel. So, it satisfies the parallelogram s definition. Hence, it is indeed a parallelogram. More specifically, a rectangle is a special kind of parallelogram with all its angles equal to 90 . Let us represent this relation using a Venn diagram. To understand the relations between the sides and the angles of a parallelogram, let us construct the following figure. D 2 Draw a parallelogram with adjacent 5cm sides of lengths 4 cm and 5 cm, and an angle of 30 between them. A 4cm B D . 5cm Step 1: Draw line segments AB = 4 cm and AD = 5 cm with an angle of ; 30 between them. %0 F A 4cm Step 2: Draw a line parallel to AB D C through the point D, and a line parallel to AD through B. Mark the 5cem point at which these lines intersect as C. Z ) A 4cm B ABCD is the required parallelogram. 2 What are the remaining angles of the parallelogram? What are the lengths of the remaining sides? See if you can reason out and/or experiment to figure these out. 6) Quadrilaterals 2 Deduction 6 What can we say about the angles of a parallelogram? In the parallelogram ABCD, AB| | CD, and AD is a transversal to them. ZA + ZD = 180 (sum of the D internal angles on the same side of a transversal). scm Therefore, ZD = 180 ZA = 180 30 = 150 . a Similarly, AD||BC, and AB and CD are transversals to them. A 4cm So, ZA + ZB = 180 . So, ZC + ZD = 180 . Using these equations, we get 7B = 150 and /C = 30 . We see that in this parallelogram, the adjacent pairs of angles add up to 180 and opposite pairs of angles are equal. Thus, ZA + ZB = 180 , ZA + ZD = 180 , ZC + ZD = 180 , and ZB + ZC = 180 . And, ZA = ZC, and ZB = ZD. Since the adjacent angles are the interior angles on the same side of a transversal to a pair of parallel lines, they must add up to 180 . (?) What about the opposite angles? Will they be equal in all parallelograms? If yes, how can we be sure? R Let us take one of the angles to be x. What are the other angles? Since ZP + ZR = 180 , ZR= 180- ZP = 180 -x. Similarly, since 7A + ZR = 180 , ZA=180- ZR= 180 - (180 x) = 180-180 + x=x. Thus, 7P = ZA =x. P E Similarly, we can deduce that 7 R= ZE= 180-x. Therefore, this shows that the opposite angles of a parallelogram are always equal. 2 Deduction 7 What can we say about the sides of
