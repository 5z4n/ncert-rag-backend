as follows B Cc Since ABCD is a rectangle, we have AB = CD ZBAD = ZCDA = 90 AD is common to both triangles. So, AADC = ADAB by the SAS congruence condition. A Common side Therefore, AC = BD, since they are corresponding parts of congruent triangles. This shows that the diagonals of a rectangle always have the same length. So the other diagonal must also be 8 cm long. You can verify this property by constructing/measuring some rectangles. Deduction 2 Whatis the point of intersection of the two diagonals? This can also be found using congruence. Since we need to know the relation between OA and OC, and OB and OD, which two triangles of the rectangle ABCD should we consider? B C B Cc A D A D The blue angles are equal since In order to show congruence, they are vertically opposite consider 71 and 72. Are they angles. equal? B C B C A D A D Since 4B = 90 , In ABCD, since 23+ Z1 = 90 . 23 + 22 + 90 = 180, we have 43 +22 = 90 . Quadrilaterals So, 21 = 22 (= 90 - 43). Thus, by the AAS condition for congruence, AAOB ~ ACOD. Hence OA = OC and OB = OD, since they are corresponding parts of congruent triangles. So, O is the midpoint of AC and BD. This shows that the diagonals of a rectangle always intersect at their midpoints. Therefore, to get a rectangle, the diagonals must be drawn so that they are equal and intersect at their midpoints. When the diagonals cross at their midpoints, we say that the diagonals bisect each other. Bisecting a quantity means dividing it into two equal parts. Verify this property by constructing some rectangles and measuring their diagonals and the points of intersection. aa , (?) Can the following equalities be used to establish that AAOD ~ ACOB? (ath P Ta AO = CO (proved above) ZAOB = ZCOD (vertically opposite angles) AD = CB Deduction 3 What are the angles between the diagonals? Let us check what quadrilateral we get ifwe draw the A B two diagonals such that their lengths are equal, they bisect each other and have an arbitrary angle, say 60 , between them as shown in the figure to the right. (?) Can you find all the remaining angles? ) OQ We can find the remaining angles between the \ diagonals using our understanding of vertically opposite angles and linear pairs. In AAOB, since OA = OB, the angles opposite them are equal, say a. (?) Can you find the value of a? Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 In AAOB, we have, a+a+ 60 = 180 (interior angles of a triangle). Therefore 2a = 120. Thus a= 60. Similarly, we can find the values of all the other angles. A D (?) Can we now identify what type of quadrilateral ABCD is? Notice that its angles all add up to
