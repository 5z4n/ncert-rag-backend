pairs. In AAOB, since OA = OB, the angles opposite them are equal, say a. (?) Can you find the value of a? Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 In AAOB, we have, a+a+ 60 = 180 (interior angles of a triangle). Therefore 2a = 120. Thus a= 60. Similarly, we can find the values of all the other angles. A D (?) Can we now identify what type of quadrilateral ABCD is? Notice that its angles all add up to 90 (30 + 60 ). (?) What can we say about its sides? yx om D re D Cc We can see that AAOB = ACOD and AAOD = ACOB. Hence, AB = CD, and AD = CB, since they are corresponding parts of congruent triangles. Therefore, ABCD is a rectangle since it satisfies the definition of a rectangle. A Will ABCD remain a rectangle if the angles between the diagonals are changed? Can we generalise this? x Take one of the angles between the diagonals as x. Quadrilaterals We can compute the four angles between the diagonals to be x, x, 180 x, and 180 x. 180 - x(X )180 - x (?) Can you find the other angles? C Since we know that AAOB is isosceles, we can A denote the measures of both of its base angles by a. (?) What is the value of a (in degrees) in terms of x? We have, at+a+x=180 (sum of the interior angles of a triangle) 2a = 180-x _ (180 x) a= =90- 5 D Similarly, in the isosceles AAOD, let the base angles be b. b+b+180- x=180 2b = 180 - (180 x) 2b = 180-180 + x 2b=x _x b=5. All the angles of the quadrilateral are a + b, which is 90-5 +5= 90. Thus, all four angles of the quadrilateral ABCD are 90 . (?) What can we say about AB and CD, and AD and BC? D We have AAOB =~ ACOD and AAOD = ACOB. Hence, AB = CD, and AD = CB, since they are the corresponding parts of congruent triangles. Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 Hence, no matter what the angles between the diagonals are, if the diagonals are equal and they bisect each other, then the angles of the quadrilateral formed are 90 each, and the opposite sides are equal. Thus, the quadrilateral is a rectangle. Now we know how the wooden strips have to be put together to form the vertices of a rectangle! They should be equal and connected at their midpoints. This method is actually used in practice to make rectangles. Carpenters in Europe use this method to get a rectangular frame. It is also known that farmers in Mozambique, a country in Africa, use this method while constructing houses to get the base of the house in a rectangular shape. The Process of Finding Properties As we have been seeing from lower grades, properties of geometric objects such as parallel lines, angles, and triangles can be
