are corresponding parts of congruent triangles. Thus, O is the midpoint of both diagonals. (?) Is it wrong to write AAOE = ASOY? Why? Property 4: The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. 2 Do the diagonals of a parallelogram intersect at a particular angle? 4.4 Quadrilaterals with Equal Sidelengths 2 Are squares the only quadrilaterals that have equal sidelengths? Let us explore this question D through construction. Draw two equal sides AD and AB, that are not perpendicular to each other. A B 2 Can we complete this quadrilateral so that all its sides are of the same length? Mark a point C whose distance from B and Dis equal to AB (or AD). To do this, measure AB using a compass. Keeping this length as the radius, cut arcs from B and D. /\ Now we have a quadrilateral with , B equal sidelengths and one of its angles 50 . Note that we could have constructed such a quadrilateral by taking any angle less than 180 (in place of 50 ). A quadrilateral in which all the sides have the same length is a rhombus. Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 2 What are the other angles of the rhombus ABCD that we have constructed? Reason and/or experiment to figure this out. Deduction 9 What can we say about the angles in a rhombus? Consider a rhombus GAME. M In AGAE, since GE = GA, a= d. Similarly, in AMAE, since ME = MA, b=c. (?) It can be seen that AGAE = AMAE (How?) (\/ So,a=b,c=dand 4G = ZM (since they are corresponding parts of congruent triangles). Thus, we have, a=b=c=d. These facts hold for any rhombus. Let us apply them to the rhombus ABCD that we constructed earlier. Let the four equal angles formed by the diagonal be a, as shown in the figure In AADB, we have at+a+50=180 . So, a= 65 . Thus, the angles of the rhombus ABCD are 50 , 130 , 50 , and 130 . So, in a rhombus opposite angles are equal to each other. Interestingly, there is one more way by which we could have figured out the other angles of the rhombus ABCD. We have shown that in a general rhombus GAME, the four angles formed by a diagonal are equal to each other. WD G Cy G Consider the lines EM and GA andits Similarly consider the lines GE transversal AE. Since the alternate and AM and its transversal AE. angles are equal, EM| |GA. Since the alternate angles are ; equal, GE| | AM. Quadrilaterals As opposite sides are parallel, GAME is also a parallelogram. Thus, every rhombus is a parallelogram, and the properties of a parallelogram hold true for a rhombus as well. Thus, the adjacent angles of arhombus add up to 180 , and the opposite angles are equal 8 (verify that the arguments in Deduction 6 can be applied to a rhombus as well!). Thus, in rhombus ABCD, ZA = ZC
