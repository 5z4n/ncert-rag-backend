Therefore, the 36th odd number is 71. By adding 71 to 1225, we get 1296, which is 367. Consider a number such as 38 that is not a square and subtract consecutive odd numbers starting from 1. 38-1=37 37-3=34 34-5=29 29-7=22 22-9=13 13-11=2 2-13=-11 This shows that 38 cannot be expressed as a sum of consecutive odd A Square and A Cube Thus, we can say that a natural number is not a perfect square if it cannot be expressed as a sum of successive odd natural numbers starting from 1. We can use this result to find out whether a natural number is a perfect square. 2 Find how many numbers lie between two consecutive perfect squares. Do you notice a pattern? (?) How many square numbers are there between 1 and 100? How many are between 101 and 200? Using the table of squares you filled earlier, enter the values below, tabulating the number of squares in each block of 100. What is the largest square less than 1000? 1-100 101-200 201-300 301-400 401 500 501-600 601-700 701-800 801-900 901 1000 Perfect Squares and Triangular Numbers Do you remember triangular numbers? eee > @@ 10 15 @ @ 00 @ 3 2 Can you see any relation between triangular numbers and square numbers?

We know that 7 x 7 = 49, or 7* = 49. Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 So, the length of the side of a square with an area of 49 sq. cm is 7 cm. We call 7 the square root of 49. In general, if y= x then x is the square root of y. 2 What is the square root of 64? We know that 8 x 8 is 64. So, 8 is the square root of 64. What about 8 x -8 ? That is 64 too! 8? = 64, and ( 8) = 64. So, the square roots of 64 are + 8 and - 8. Every perfect square has two integer square roots. One is positive and the other is negative. The square root of a number is denoted by Thus, V64=+8 and V100=+10, Note that V8? =+8 and Vi0? =+10.In general, Vi =n, In this chapter, we shall only consider the positive square root. Given a number, such as 576 or 327, how do we find out if itis a |_g@ perfect square? If it is a perfect square, how can we find its square root? Talk We know that perfect squares end in 1, 4, 9, 6, 5, or an even number of zeros. But, it is not certain that a number that satisfies this condition is a square. We can clearly say that 327 is not a perfect square. However, we cannot be sure that 576 is a perfect square. 1. We can
