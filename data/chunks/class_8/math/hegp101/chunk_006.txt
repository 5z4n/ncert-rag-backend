For example, to find 1936, we can reason as follows: (i) 1936 is between 1600 (407) and 2500 (507), so 40 < 1936 < 50. (ii) The last digit of 1936 is 6. So, the last digit of the square root must either be 4 or 6. It can be 44 or 46. (iii) If we calculate 45*, we can compare it with 1936 to halve the interval to search from 40-50 to either 40-45 or 45-50. We can write 45 as (40 + 5) (40 + 5) = 407+ 2 x 40x 5+ 5? = 1600 + 400 + 25 = 2025. (iv) 2025 > 1936. So, 40 < 1936 < 45 (v) From the observation in point b we can guess and then verify that V1936 is 44. Consider the following situations Aribam and Bijou play a game. One says a number and the other replies with its square root. Aribam starts. He says 25, and Bijou quickly Gy) Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 responds with 5. Then Bijou says 81, and Aribam answers 9. The game goes on till Aribam says 250. Bijou is not able to answer because 250 is not a perfect square. Aribam asks Bijou if he can at least provide a number that is close to the square root of 250. For this, Bijou needs to estimate the square root of 250. We know that 100 < 250 < 400 and 100 = 10 and ./400 = 20. So, 10 < 250 < 20. But, we are still not very close to the number whose square is 250. We know that 15 = 225 and 16? = 256. Therefore, 15 < ./250 < 16. Since 256 is much closer to 250 than 225, /250 is approximately 16. We also know it is less than 16. Here is another problem that requires estimating square roots. Akhil has a square piece of cloth of area 125 cm . He wants to know if he can cut out a square handkerchief of side 15 cm. If not, he wants to know the maximum size handkerchief that can be cut out from this piece of cloth with an integer side length. 125 is not a perfect square. The nearest perfect squares are 11? = 121 and 12*= 144. So the largest square handkerchief with integer side length that can be cut out from this piece of cloth has side length 11 cm. 2 Figure it Out 1. Which of the following numbers are not perfect squares? (i) 2032 (ii) 2048 (iii) 1027 (iv) 1089 2. Which one among 64 , 1087, 292 , 36 has last digit 4? 3. Given 1257 = 15625, what is the value of 1267? (i) 15625 + 126 (ii) 15625 + 267 (iii) 15625 + 253 (iv) 15625 + 251 (v) 15625 + 51 4, Find the length of the side of a square whose area is 441 m . 5. Find the smallest square number that is divisible by each of
