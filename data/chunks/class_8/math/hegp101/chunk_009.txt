numbers have a role to play with cubes too. Look at the following pattern: 1=1=1 3+5=8=2 7+9+11=27=3 13+15+17+19=64=4 21+23+25+27+29=125=5 31+ 33+ 35+ 37+ 39+ 41 =216=6 . Later in this series, we get the following set of consecutive numbers: 91+93+95+97+99+ 101 + 103 + 105 + 107 + 109. 2 Can you tell what this sum is without doing the calculation? Cube Roots We know that 8 = 2 . We call 2 the cube root of 8 and denote this by 2 = as. More generally, if y = x , then x is the cube root of y. This is denoted by x= y.So, VB = V2 =2. Similarly, /27= /3 =3 and */1000 = */10 =3. In general, Vn =n. How do we find out if a number is a cube? Taking inspiration from the case of squares, let us see if we can use prime factorisations. 2 Let us check if 3375 is a perfect cube. 3375 =3x3x3x5%x5x5. Can the factors be split into three identical groups? For 3375, we can form three groups of (3 x 5). So, 3375 = (3 x 5) x (3 x 5) x (3 x 5) =(3 x 5) =15 . Another way is to check if the factors can be grouped into triplet(s): 3375 =(3 x3 3)x(5x5x5)=3 x 5%. This means 3375 =15. 2 Is 500 a perfect cube? 500 =2x2x5*x5 x5. Wesee that the factors cannot be split into three identical groups. Therefore, 500 is not a perfect cube. A Square and A Cube Prime Factorisation of a Number Prime Factorisation of its Cube 4=64=2x2x2x2x2x2=2 x 2? 6 =216=2x2x2x3x3x3=2'x 3 15=3%x5 15 = 3375 =3x3x3x5x5x5=3 x5> 12 =1728=2*x2x2x2x2x2x3x3x3 12=2x2x3 53 x 93 x 33 Observe that each prime factor of a number appears three times in the prime factorisation of its cube. 2 Find the cube roots of these numbers: (i) 3/64 = (ii) 3/512 = (iii) 3/729 = Successive Differences We know that the differences between consecutive perfect squares gives the sequence of odd numbers. Observe the figure below where the differences are computed successively for perfect squares. After two levels, all the differences are the same. Perfect al 1 4 9 25 36..

Perfect Cubes 1 8 27 6 125 216... 1.3 A Pinch of History The first known list of perfect squares and perfect cubes was compiled by the Babylonians as far back as 1700 BCE. These lists, found on clay tablets, were used to quickly find square roots and cube Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 roots in problems involving land measurement, architectural design, and other areas where geometric calculations were necessary. In ancient Sanskrit works the term varga was used both for the square figure or its area, as well as the square
