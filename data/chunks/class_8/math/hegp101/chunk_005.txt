find out if itis a |_g@ perfect square? If it is a perfect square, how can we find its square root? Talk We know that perfect squares end in 1, 4, 9, 6, 5, or an even number of zeros. But, it is not certain that a number that satisfies this condition is a square. We can clearly say that 327 is not a perfect square. However, we cannot be sure that 576 is a perfect square. 1. We can list all the square numbers in sequence and find out whether 576 occurs among them. We know that 202 = 400, we can find squares of 21, 22, 23, ... and so on until we get 576 or a number greater than 576. 20?=400 21 =441 227=484 237=529 24 =576 However, this process becomes inefficient for larger numbers. 2. Recall that every square can be expressed as a sum of consecutive odd numbers starting from 1. Consider /81. 81-1 4380) 80-3=77 77-5=72 72-7=65 65-9=56 96-11=45 45-13=32 32-15=17 17-17=0 From 81, we successively subtracted consecutive odd numbers starting from 1 until we obtained 0 at the 9th step. Therefore V81 =9, Can we find the square root of 729 using this method? Yes, but it will be time-consuming. A Square and A Cube 3. We know that a perfect square is obtained by multiplying an integer by itself. Will looking at a number s prime factorisation help in determining whether it is a perfect square? Yes, if we can divide the prime factors of a number into two equal groups, then the product of the prime factors in either group combine to form the square root. 2 Is 324 a perfect square? 324=2x2x3x3x3>x 3. These can be grouped as 324 = (2 x 3 x 3) x (2 x 3 x 3). =(2 x3 x 3) =187. We can also write the prime factors in pairs. That is, 324 = (2 x 2) x (3 x 3) x (3 x 3), which shows that 324 is a perfect square. Thus, 324 = (2x3x3)* = 187. Therefore, 324 =18. (?) Is 156 a perfect square? The prime factorisation of 156 is 2 x 2 x 3 x 13. We cannot pair up these factors. Therefore, 156 is not a perfect square. (?) Find whether 1156 and 2800 are perfect squares using prime factorisation. We can estimate the square root of larger perfect squares by looking at the closest perfect squares we are familiar with and then narrowing down the interval to search. For example, to find 1936, we can reason as follows: (i) 1936 is between 1600 (407) and 2500 (507), so 40 < 1936 < 50. (ii) The last digit of 1936 is 6. So, the last digit of the square root must either be 4 or 6. It can be 44 or 46. (iii) If we calculate 45*, we can compare it with 1936 to halve the interval to search from 40-50 to either 40-45 or 45-50. We can write
