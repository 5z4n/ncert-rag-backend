of people and it will eventually be closed. Note that each factor of a number has a partner factor so that the product of the pair of factors yields the given number. Here, 1 and 6 form a pair of partner factors of 6, and 2 and 3 form another pair. (?) Does every number have an even number of factors? 4: 1: 1x4 txt 2x2 me only factor Factors are 1s i. 1, 2 and 4. We see in some cases, like 2 x 2, that the numbers in the pair are the same. (?) Can you use this insight to find more numbers with an odd number of factors? For instance, 36 has a factor pair 6 x 6 where both numbers are 6. Does this number have an odd number of factors? If every factor of 36 other than 6 has a different factor as its partner, then we can be sure that 36 has an odd number of factors. Check if this is true. Hence all the following numbers have an odd number of factors 1x1,2x2,3x3,4x4,... A number that can be expressed as the product of a number with itself is called a square number, or simply a square. The only numbers that have an odd number of factors are the squares, because they each have one factor which, when multiplied by itself, equals the number. Therefore, every locker whose number is a square will remain open. Khoisnam immediately collects word clues from these 10 lockers and reads, The passcode consists of the first five locker numbers that were touched exactly twice. Which are these five lockers? The lockers that are toggled twice are the prime numbers, since each prime number has 1 and the number itself as factors. So, the code is \, 2-3-5-7-11. ; a TTTTTLLTTLTLTTLTTTTtFE @) Nn en 1.1 Square Numbers Why are the numbers, 1, 4, 9, 16, ..., called squares? We know that the number of unit squares in a square (the area of a square) is the product of its sides. The table below gives the areas of squares with different sides. Sidelength Area (in units) (in sq units) 1x 1=1 sq. unit a Ta | aap ants 383x329 sq.units We use the following notation for squares. 1x1=1=1 2x2=2 =4 3x 3=37=9, 4x4=4' =16 5x5 =57=25. In general, for any number n, we write n x n= n , which is read as n squared . Can we have a square of sidelength - or 2.5 units? Yes, there area in square units are (2) = 4 x (3) = (35), and (2.5) = (2.5) x (2.5) = 6.25. 3) Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 The squares of natural numbers are called perfect squares. For example, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ... are all perfect squares. Patterns and Properties of Perfect Squares Find the squares of the first 30 natural numbers and fill in the table below. 1 =1 112=121 21? = 441 2 =4 12? = 292 = 3
