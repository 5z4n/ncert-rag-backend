and their squares. 10 = 100 20 = 400 40 = 800 But we have two zeroes. We have one zero. 100? = 10000 We have 200 = 40000 But we have two zeroes. 700 = 49000 four zeroes. 900? = 81000 2 If anumber contains 3 zeros at the end, how many zeros will its square have at the end? What do you notice about the number of zeros at the end of a number and the number of zeros at the end of its square? Will this always happen? Can we say that squares can only have an even number of zeros at the end? 2 What can you say about the parity of a number and its square? Perfect Squares and Odd Numbers Let us explore the differences between consecutive squares. What do you notice? 4-1=3 9-4=5 16-9=7 25-16=9 See if this pattern continues for the next few square numbers. From this we observe that adding consecutive odd numbers starting from 1 gives consecutive square numbers, as shown below. 1=1 1+3=4 1+3+5=9 1+3+5+7=16 1+3+5+7+9=25 eee 1+3+5+7+9+11=36. elelee le (6) numbers starting with 1. Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 Do you remember this pattern from Grade 6? The picture below explains why each subsequent inverted L gives the next odd number: 83 333 1+3 1+3+(3+2) 1+3+5 14+3+5+(5+2) 1+3+5+7 We see that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n . Alternatively, every square is a sum of successive odd numbers starting from 1. In mathematics, sometimes arguments and reasoning can be presented without any words. Visual proofs can be complete by themselves. Also, we can find out whether a number is a perfect square by successively subtracting odd numbers. Consider the number 25, successively subtract 1, 3, 5, ... until you get or cross over 0, 25-1=24 24-3=21 21 5= 16 TO -G= 9 9-9=0 This means 25 = 1+ 3+5+7+9and is thus a perfect square. Since we subtracted the first five odd numbers, 25 = 57. 2 Using the pattern above, find 36 , given that 35 = 1225. From the question we know that 1225 is the sum of the first 35 odd numbers. To find 36 , we need to add the 36th odd number to 1225. (?) How do we find the 36th odd number? The 1st odd number is 1, 2nd odd number is 3, 3rd number is 5, ..., 6th odd number is 11 and so on. (?) What is the n odd number? The n odd number is 2n-1. Therefore, the 36th odd number is 71. By adding 71 to 1225, we get 1296, which is 367. Consider a number such as 38 that is not a square and subtract consecutive odd numbers starting from 1. 38-1=37 37-3=34 34-5=29 29-7=22 22-9=13 13-11=2 2-13=-11 This shows that 38 cannot be expressed as a sum of consecutive odd A Square and A Cube Thus, we can say that a natural number is not a perfect square if it cannot be expressed
