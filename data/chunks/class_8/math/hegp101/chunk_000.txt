Before t process | ~ already knows whicl Queen Ratnamanjuri had a will written that described her fortune of ratnas (precious stones) and also included a puzzle. Her son Khoisnam and their 99 relatives were invited to the reading of her will. She wanted to leave all of her ratnas to her son, but she knew that if she did so, all their relatives would pester Khoisnam forever. She hoped that she had taught him everything he needed to know about solving puzzles. She left the following note in her will I have created a puzzle. If all 100 of you answer it at the same time, you will share the ratnas equally. However, if you are the first one to solve the problem, you will get to keep the entire inheritance to yourself. Good luck. The minister took Khoisnam and his 99 relatives to a secret room in the mansion containing 100 lockers. The minister explained Each person is assigned a number from 1 to 100. Person 1 opens every locker. * Person 2 toggles every 2nd locker (i.e., closes it if it is open, opens it if it is closed). Person 3 toggles every 3rd locker (3rd, 6th, 9th, ... and so on). Person 4 toggles every 4th locker (4th, 8th, 12th, ... and so on). This continues until all 100 get their turn. In the end, only some lockers remain open. The open lockers reveal the code to the fortune in the safe. ae ~ gin , Khoisna realises that | el lockers will be open at the e1 d.

Otherwise, it will be closed. The number of times a locker is toggled is the same as the number of factors of the locker number. For example, for locker #6, Person 1 opens it, Person 2 closes it, Person 3 opens it and Person 6 closes it. The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 6 are factors of 6. If the number of factors is even, the locker will be toggled by an even number of people and it will eventually be closed. Note that each factor of a number has a partner factor so that the product of the pair of factors yields the given number. Here, 1 and 6 form a pair of partner factors of 6, and 2 and 3 form another pair. (?) Does every number have an even number of factors? 4: 1: 1x4 txt 2x2 me only factor Factors are 1s i. 1, 2 and 4.
