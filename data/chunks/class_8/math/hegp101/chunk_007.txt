Find the square root of the product. 7. How many numbers lie between the squares of the following numbers? (i) 16 and 17 (ii) 99 and 100 8. In the following pattern, fill in the missing numbers: A Square and A Cube 124+ 2724+ 22 = 32 22 4324 62= 72 3? + 4 + 12? = 13? 42 +52+202= (_/ 9 + 10 + (_)*=(_) 9. How many tiny squares are there in the following picture? Write the prime factorisation of the number of tiny squares. 1.2 Cubic Numbers You know the word cube from geometry. A cube is a solid figure all of whose all sides meet at right angles and are equal. How many cubes of side 1 cm make a cube of side 2 cm? 2 How many cubes of side 1 cm will make a cube of side 3 cm? Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 Consider the numbers 1, 8, 27, ... These numbers are called perfect cubes. Can you see why they are named so? Each of them is obtained by multiplying a number by itself three times. We note that 1=1x1x1 8=2x2x2 27=3x3x3 (?) Is 9 a cube? We see that 2 x 2 x 2=8 and 3 x 3 x 3 = 27. This shows that 9 is not a perfect cube. Nor is any number from 10 to 26. (?) Can you estimate the number of unit cubes in a cube with an edge length of 4 units? It has 64 unit cubes! If you notice carefully, each layer of this cube has 4 x 4 unit cubes. Each square layer has 16 unit cubes (4 x 4), and there are 4 such layers, so the total number of unit cubes is 4 x 4 x 4 = 64. Since 5 =5*x5x5=125, 125 is a cube. In general, for any number n, we write the cube nxnxnasn . 2 Complete the table below. 1=1 11 = 1331 2 >=8 12 = 3 =27 13? = 2197 4 = 64 14 = 2744 5 =125 15 = 6 = 16 = P= 17 = 4913 8 = 18 = 5832 9 = 19 = 6859 10 = 20 = a , 2 What patterns do you notice in the table above?
