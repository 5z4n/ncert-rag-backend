what its cube root is? Similarly, guess the cube roots of 4913, 12167, and 32768. = A Square and A Cube 5. Which of the following is the greatest? Explain your reasoning. (i) 67 - 66 (ii) 43 - 42 (iii) 67 66 (iv) 43? 42? = A number obtained by multiplying a number by itself is called a square number. Squares of natural numbers are called perfect squares. m= All perfect squares end with 0, 1, 4, 5, 6 or 9. Squares can only have an even number of zeros at the end. = Square root is the inverse operation of square. Every perfect square has two integral square roots. The positive square root of a number is denoted by the symbol V. For example, v9 = 3. = A number obtained by multiplying a number by itself three times is called a cube. For example 1, 8, 27, ... ,etc., are cubes. = A number is a perfect square if its prime factors can be split into two identical groups. = Anumber is a perfect cube if its prime factors can be split into three identical groups = Thesymbol 3/ denotes cube root. For example, 3/27 = 3. Look at the following numbers:3 6 10 15 1 They are arranged such that each pair of adjacent numbers adds up to a square. 3+6=9,6+10=16,10+15=25,15+1= 16. Try arranging the numbers 1 to 17 (without repetition) in a row ina similar way the sum of every adjacent pair of numbers should be a square. Can you arrange them in more than one way? If not, can you explain why? Can you do the same with numbers from 1 to 32 (again, without repetition), but this time arranging all the numbers in a circle?
