to check divisibility by 11? Chapter 5 Letter Number Play 06-07-2025.indd 127 a , Math \* a, Math \* 10-07-2025 15:07:59 Pipa ood Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 We saw that the place values alternate as 1 more and 1 less than a multiple of 11. Using this observation, i) . Add the digits of place values which are 1 more (than a multiple of 11), i.e., place values corresponding to 1, 100, 10000, and so on. . Add the digits of place values which are 1 less (than a multiple of 11), ie., place values corresponding to 10, 1000, 100000, and so on. 3. Compute the difference between these two sums, i.e., Number in excess) (number short). To know how much in excess We are with respect to a multiple of 11 for these place values. To know how short we are with respect to a multiple of 11 for these place values. To know the remainder obtained when divided by 11. 2 x 10,000 Cosees veces) a?

(3 short of a multiple of 11) The difference between these two sums 8 - 11 = 3, indicating that the number 3,28,105 is 3 short of or 8 more than a multiple of 11. (?) If this difference is 11 or a multiple of 11, what does that say about the remainder obtained when the number is divisible by 11? 2 Using this shortcut, find out whether the following numbers are divisible by 11. Further, find the remainder if the number is not divisible by 11.

Place alternating + and ~ signs before every digit -3+2-8+1-0+5 starting from the unit s digit. 2. Evaluate the expression. -3+2-8+1-0+5=-3 3. The result denotes the remainder obtained when the number is divided by 11. 328105 is 3 less than or 8 more than a multiple of 11 2 Is this method similar to or different from the method we saw just before? 42, Math (2) Fill in the following table.
