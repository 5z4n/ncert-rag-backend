Always, Sometimes, or Never 2 We examine different statements about factors and multiples and determine whether a statement is Always True , Sometimes True , or Never True . We know that the sum of any two multiples of 2 is also a multiple of 2. (?) 1. If 8 exactly divides two numbers separately, it must exactly divide their sum. Explanation with Algebra and Visualisation Examples have 8 as a factor; in other words, the two numbers are multiples of 8. The two numbers 8a and 8b. 8 and 16. 16 and 56. 80 and 120. are obtained by repeatedly adding 8, the sum of two multiples of 8 will also be a multiple of 8. As multiples of 8 8a + 8b =8 (a+b). SMOI D SMOL SMOJ (q+D) 8+ 16 = 8(1 + 2) = 24, 16 + 56 = 72. 80 + 120 = 200. as) Statement 1 is always true. Determine if it is true with subtraction. Chapter 5 Letter Number Play 06-07-2025.indd 118 ~ 10-07-2025 15:07:58 Number Play In general, if a divides M and a divides N, then a divides M+ N and a divides M - N. In other words, if M and N are multiples of a, then M+ Nand M-Nwill also be multiples of a. (?) 2. If anumber is divisible by 8, then 8 also divides any two numbers (separately) that add up to the number. Explanation with Algebra and Visualisation Examples A number 8m 8, 16, 56, 72. divisible by 8 is a multiple of 8. A number 8m = 8a + 8b : 3 72 = 48+ 24 divisible 8m=ptq Peeceeeall ~ (8x9 by 8 can be (p, q not g= = 8x6 + 8x3). expressed as multiples of = 3 a sum of two 8) = |% 72 = 50 +22 multiples of 8 or sum of two nonmultiples of 8. So, statement 2 is sometimes true. (?) 3. Ifa number is divisible by 7, then all multiples of that number will be divisible by 7. Explanation with Algebra and Visualisation Examples Numbers divisible by 7 7j 14=7x2(=2). will have 7 as a factor. 42=7x6(U=6). 98 = 7x14 (j= 14). This contains atotalof | (7j)xm ri Some multiples of ny rows. So this is also a = 14: multiple of 7. 28 = (7 x 2) x 2. 70 = (7 x 2) x5. 154 =(7 x 2)x11 smo [ esol The number 7jm or (7 x j x m) has a factor of 7. We can see that Statement 3 is always true.

Ifanumber is divisible by 12, then the number is also divisible by all the factors of 12. Explanation with Algebra and Visualisation Examples A number divisible by 12m 12, 24, 36, 48, 12 is
