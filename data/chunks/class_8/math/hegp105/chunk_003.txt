which of the other expressions always give even numbers. Write a couple of examples and non-examples, as appropriate, for each expression. 2 Write a few algebraic expressions which always give an even number. Pairs to Make Fours 2 Take a pair of even numbers. Add them. Is the sum divisible by 4? Try this with different pairs of even numbers. When is the sum a multiple of 4, and when is it not? Is there a general rule or a pattern? Even numbers can be of two types based on the remainders they leave when divided by 4. Even numbers that are multiples Even numbers that are not of 4 leave a remainder of 0 when multiples of 4 leave a remainder 2 divided by 4. when divided by 4. Chapter 5 Letter Number Play 06-07-2025.indd 116 : 10-07-2025 15:07:58 Number Play (?) When will two even numbers add up to give a multiple of 4? This problem is similar to the question of identifying when adding two numbers will result in an even number. Can you see this? There are three cases to examine: Explanation with Algebra and Visualisation Examples Adding Ap and 4q. ~ 4,12, 16, 24, two (even) g 4 g 36. numbers that Ap + 4q a a are multiples =4(p+q). 12 +16 of 4 will always =4(3+4) give a multiple = 28. of 4. 5 _ ry 16+ 28 > 3 =4(4+7) a = 44, Adding two (4p + 2) and (4q + 2). 7 = 2,6, 10, 18, even numbers g 4 g 22, 42. that are not (4p + 2) + (4q + 2) x multiples =4p+4q+4 2+6=8. of 4 will =4(p+qz+1). 6+10=16. always give a < 22 + 6 = 28. multiple of 4 $ = because their a remainders of = ye tow | 2 add up to 4. 3 g What happens when we add a multiple of 4 to an even number that is not a multiple of 4? Is it similar to the case of the parity of the sum of an even and an odd number ? (?) Look at the following expressions and the visualisation. Write the corresponding explanation and examples.

Explanation with Algebra and Visualisation smol d Z dapulpula D yjim smoi (b + d) Examples Notice how we are able to generalise and prove properties of arithmetic using algebra and also using visualisation. Always, Sometimes, or Never 2 We examine different statements about factors and multiples and determine whether a statement is Always True , Sometimes True , or Never True . We know that the sum of any two multiples of 2 is also a multiple of 2. (?) 1. If 8 exactly divides two numbers separately, it must exactly divide their sum. Explanation with Algebra and Visualisation Examples have 8 as a factor; in other words, the two numbers are multiples
