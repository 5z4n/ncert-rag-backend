(iii) Ifa number is not divisible by 9, then the sum of its digits is not divisible by 9. (iv) Ifthe sum of the digits of a number is not divisible by 9, then the number is not divisible by 9. following procedures but about understanding why something =f, Learning maths is not just about knowing some shortcuts and works. 2 Figure it Out 1. Find, without dividing, whether the following numbers are divisible by 9. (i) 123 (i) 405 = (iii) 8888 _~ (iv) 93547 ~ (v) 358095 2. Find the smallest multiple of 9 with no odd digits. 3. Find the multiple of 9 that is closest to the number 6000. 4. How many multiples of 9 are there between the numbers 4300 and 4400? A Shortcut for Divisibility by 3 We know that all the multiples of 9 are also multiples of 3. That is, if a number is divisible by 9, it will also be divisible by 3. However, there are other multiples of 3 that are not multiples of 9 for example 15, 33, and 87. 2 The shortcut to find the divisibility by 3 is similar to the method for 9. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Explore the remainders when powers of 10 are divided by 3. Explain why this method works. A Shortcut for Divisibility by 11 Interestingly, the shortcut for 11 is also based on checking the remainders with place value. Let us see how. a.

Since 400 contains 4 hundreds, 400 is 4 more than a multiple of 11 (396 + 4). Since 60 contains 6 tens, 60 is 6 less than a multiple of 11 (66 6). Since 2 contains 2 units, 2 is 2 more than a multiple of 11, Le. 2=(0+ 2). Using these observations, can you tell whether the number 462 is divisible by 11? (?) What could be a general method or shortcut to check divisibility by 11?

Using this observation, i) . Add the digits of place values which are 1 more (than a multiple of 11), i.e., place values corresponding to 1, 100, 10000, and so on. . Add the
