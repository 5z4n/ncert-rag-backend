sum of an odd number and an even number will be an odd number. Therefore, this statement is never true. We can also explain this algebraically. Suppose, (2n) + (2m + 1) = 6), where 2n is an even number, 2m+ 1is an odd number, and 6j is a multiple of 6. Then 2n+2m=6 -1 2(n+m)=6j-1 which means 2(n + m), which is an even number, should be equal to 6j - 1, which is an odd number. This is never true. Can I write an even and an odd number as 2n and 2n+1 instead? What Remains? 2 Find a number that has a remainder of 3 when divided by 5. Write more such numbers. (?) Which algebraic expression(s) capture all such numbers? ()3k+5 (Gi)3k-5 _ (iii) 3k (iv)5k+3 (v)5k-2 (wi)5k-3 The numbers that leave a remainder of 0 when divided by 5 are the multiples of 5. But we want numbers that leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 5. These numbers are 3 more than multiples of 5. Multiples of 5 are of the form 5k. So, numbers that leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 5 are those of the form 5k + 3 < 5 OQOO0O0O0T, g k=|0 1 2 3 A elelelelon a 5k+3=13 8 13 18 23 lero) a.

Are there other expressions that generate numbers that are 3 more than a multiple of 5? 2 Figure it Out 1. Thesum of four consecutive numbers is 34. What are these numbers? 2. Suppose p is the greatest of five consecutive numbers. Describe the other four numbers in terms of p. 3. For each statement below, determine whether it is always true, sometimes true, or never true. Explain your answer. Mention examples and non-examples as appropriate. Justify your claim using algebra. (i) The sum of two even numbers is a multiple of 3. (ii) If a number is not divisible by 18, then it is also not divisible by 9. (iii) If two numbers are not divisible by 6, then their sum is not divisible by 6. (iv) The sum of a multiple of 6 and a multiple of 9 is a multiple of 3. (v) The sum ofa multiple of 6 and a multiple of 3 is a multiple of 9. 4. Find a few numbers that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 3 and a remainder of 2 when divided by 4. Write an algebraic expression to describe all such numbers. 5.
