x 2 = 94, 31 x 3 = 93, 16 x 6 = 96. (?) (vii) Here is one more: BYE ~ 6 = RAY. Anshu says, Since the product is a 3-digit number, B can t be 2 or more. If B = 2, ie., 2 hundreds, the product will be more than 1200. So, B = 1. (?) What can you say about Y ? What digits are possible/not possible? Y cannot be 7 or more because, if Y = 7, then 170 x 6 = 1020; but we want a 3-digit product. Also, Y will be even , Anshu explains. We can solve cryptarithms using patterns, properties, and reasoning related to numbers and operations. (?) Solve the following: (i) UTx3=PUT (i) ABx5=BC (iii) L2N x 2 = 2NP (iv) XYx4=ZX (v) PPxQQ=PRP (vi) JK x 6 = KKK 2 Figure it Out 1. If 31z5 is a multiple of 9, where z is a digit, what is the value of z? Explain why there are two answers to this problem. 2. Itake a number that leaves a remainder of 8 when divided by 12. I take another number which is 4 short of a multiple of 12. Their sum will always be a multiple of 8 , claims Snehal. Examine his claim and justify your conclusion. 3. When is the sum of two multiples of 3, a multiple of 6 and when is it not? Explain the different possible cases, and generalise the pattern. 4. Sreelatha says, I have a number that is divisible by 9. If I reverse its digits, it will still be divisible by 9 . (i) Examine if her conjecture is true for any multiple of 9. (ii) Are any other digit shuffles possible such that the number formed is still a multiple of 9? 5. If 48a23b is a multiple of 18, list all possible pairs of values for a and b. Chapter 5 Letter Number Play 06-07-2025.indd 132 10-07-2025 15:08:00 Number Play 6. If 3p7q8 is divisible by 44, list all possible pairs of values for p and q. 7. Find three consecutive numbers such that the first number isa / multiple of 2, the second number is a multiple of 3, and the third ez number is a multiple of 4. Are there more such numbers? How often do they occur? ge. 8. Write five multiples of 36 between 45,000 and 47,000. (Math \* Share your approach with the class. Talk 9. The middle number in the sequence of 5 consecutive even numbers is 5p. Express the other four numbers in sequence in terms of p. 10. Write a 6-digit number that it is divisible by 15, such that when the digits are reversed, it is divisible by 6. 11. Deepak claims, There are some multiples of 11 which, when doubled, are still multiples of 11. But other multiples of 11 don t remain multiples of 11 when doubled . Examine if his conjecture is true; explain your conclusion. 12.
