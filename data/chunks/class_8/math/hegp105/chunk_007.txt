sum of a multiple of 6 and a multiple of 9 is a multiple of 3. (v) The sum ofa multiple of 6 and a multiple of 3 is a multiple of 9. 4. Find a few numbers that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 3 and a remainder of 2 when divided by 4. Write an algebraic expression to describe all such numbers. 5. I hold some pebbles, not too many, When I group them in 3 s, one stays with me. Try pairing them up it simply won t do, A stubborn odd pebble remains in my view. Group them by 5, yet one s still around, But grouping by seven, perfection is found. More than one hundred would be far too bold, Can you tell me the number of pebbles I hold? 6. Tathagat has written several numbers that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 6. He claims, If you add any three such numbers, the sum will always be a multiple of 6. Is Tathagat s claim true?

Without calculating, can you say what remainders the following expressions will leave when divided by 7? Show the solution both algebraically and visually. (i) 4779 + 661 (ii) 4779 - 661 8. Find a number that leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, a remainder of 3 when divided by 4, and a remainder of 4 when divided by 5. What is the smallest such number? Can you give a simple explanation of why it is the smallest? 5.2 Checking Divisibility Quickly Earlier, you have learnt shortcuts to check whether a given number, written in the Indian number system is divisible by 2, 4, 5, 8, and 10. Let us revisit them. Divisibility by 10, 5, and 2: If the units digit of a number is 0 , then it is divisible by 10. Let us understand why this works through algebra. We can write the general form of a number in the Indian system using a set of letter-numbers. For example, a 5-digit number can be expressed as, edcba denoting e x 10000 + dx 1000 +c x 100+bx10+a.The letter-numbers e, d, c, b, and a denote each digit of a 5-digit number. Any number can be written in general as...dcba, where the letternumbers a, b,c and d represent the units, tens, hundreds and thousands digit, respectively, and so on. As a sum of place values, this number is ... +1000d + 100c + 10b + a. (For example, in the number 4075, d= 4,c = 0,b=7, anda=5.) We know that each place value, with the exception of the units place, is a multiple of 10. So, 10b, 100c, ... all will be multiples of 10. Hence, the number will be divisible by 10 if and only if the
