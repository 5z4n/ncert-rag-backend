consecutive even numbers is 5p. Express the other four numbers in sequence in terms of p. 10. Write a 6-digit number that it is divisible by 15, such that when the digits are reversed, it is divisible by 6. 11. Deepak claims, There are some multiples of 11 which, when doubled, are still multiples of 11. But other multiples of 11 don t remain multiples of 11 when doubled . Examine if his conjecture is true; explain your conclusion. 12. Determine whether the statements below are Always True , Sometimes True , or Never True . Explain your reasoning. (i) The product of a multiple of 6 and a multiple of 3 is a multiple of 9. (ii) The sum of three consecutive even numbers will be divisible by 6. (iii) If abcdef is a multiple of 6, then badcef will be a multiple of 6. (iv) 8(7b-3)-4 (11b + 1) is a multiple of 12. 13. Choose any 3 numbers. When is their sum divisible by 3? Explore all possible cases and generalise. 14. Is the product of two consecutive integers always multiple of 2? Why? What about the product of these consecutive integers? Is it always a multiple of 6? Why or why not? What can you say about the product of 4 consecutive integers? What about the product of five consecutive integers? 15. Solve the cryptarithms (i) EF x E= GGG (ii) WOW x 5 = MEOW 16. Which of the following Venn diagrams captures the relationship between the multiples of 4, 8, and 32?

Multiples of 32 Meuuples of 4 of 4 Mauuples of 32 = We explored and learnt various properties of divisibility * Ifais divisible by b, then all multiples of a are divisible by b. Ifais divisible by b, then ais divisible by all the factors of b. Ifadivides mand a divides n, then a divides m+nand m-n. * If ais divisible by b and is also divisible by c, then a is divisible by the LCM of b and c. = We learnt shortcuts to check divisibility by 3, 9 and 11, and why they work. = Through all this we were exposed to the power of mathematical thinking and reasoning, using algebra, visualisation, examples and counterexamples. Navakankari, also known as Sdlu Mane Ata, Char-Par, or Navkakri, is a traditional Indian board game that is the same as Nine Men s Morris or Mills in the West . It is a strategy game for two players where the goal is to form lines of three pawns to eliminate the opponent s pawns or block their movement. Gameplay 1. Each player starts with 9 pawns.
