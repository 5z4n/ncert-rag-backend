all the i ~_ ~d combinations a+ b+c+dalways have the same parity, without having to go through N\ _ +d them one by one. C __q solved in different ways. While the method you came up with may be dear to you, it can be amusing and enriching to know heat Several problems in mathematics can be thought about and how others thought about it. Two tidbits: share and listen . (?) Is the phenomenon of all the expressions having the same parity limited to taking 4 numbers? What do you think? What if ...? , Will it always happen? Wondering and posing questions and conjectures is as much a part of mathematics as problem solving. Breaking Even We know how to identify even numbers. Without computing them, find out which of the following arithmetic expressions are even. 43 + 37 672 348 4 x 347 x3 708 477 809 + 214 119 x 303 543 479 513 2 Using our understanding of how parity behaves under different operations, identify which of the following algebraic expressions give an even number for any integer values for the letter-numbers. 2a + 2b 3g+5h 4m+2n 2u 4v 13k-5k 6m-3n alee! be+1 Ak x 3] Chapter 5 Letter Number Play 06-07-2025.indd 115 = 10-07-2025 15:07:58 Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 The expression 4m + 2q will always evaluate to an even number for any integer values of m and q. We can justify this in two different ways We know 4m is even and 2q is even for any integers m and q. Therefore, their sum will also be even. The expression 4m + 2q is equal to the expression 2(2m + q). Here, the expression 2(2m + q) means 2 times 2m + q. In other words, 2 is a factor of this expression. Therefore, this expression will always give an even number for any integers m and q. For example, if m = 4 and q = - 9, the expression 4m + 2q becomes 4x 4+ 2 x (-9) = 2, which is an even number. In the expression x + 2, x is even if x is even, and x is odd if x is odd. Therefore, the expression x* + 2 will not always give an even number. An example and a non-example for when the expression evaluates to an even number (i) if x = 6, then x + 2 = 38, and (ii) if x = 3, then x* + 2 =11. (?) Similarly, determine and explain which of the other expressions always give even numbers. Write a couple of examples and non-examples, as appropriate, for each expression. 2 Write a few algebraic expressions which always give an even number. Pairs to Make Fours 2 Take a pair of even numbers. Add them. Is the sum divisible by 4? Try this with different pairs of even numbers. When is the sum a multiple of 4, and when is it not? Is there a general rule or a
