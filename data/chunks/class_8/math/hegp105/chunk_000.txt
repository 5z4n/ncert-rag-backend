He has written the following Now, he is wondering Can I write every natural number as a sum of consecutive numbers? e Which numbers can I write as the sum of consecutive numbers in more than one way? Ohh, I know all odd numbers can be written as a sum of two consecutive numbers. Can we write all even numbers as a sum of consecutive numbers? * Can I write 0 as a sum of consecutive numbers? Maybe I should use negative numbers. a , 2 Explore these questions and any others that may occur to you. ( ati Discuss them with the class. Ta 2 Take any 4 consecutive numbers. For example, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Place + and ~ signs in between the numbers. How many different possibilities exist? Write all of them. Chapter 5 Letter Number Play 06-07-2025.indd 112 10-07-2025 15:07:56 Number Play Eight such expressions are possible. You can use the diagram below to systematically list all the possibilities. _t 6 ------- >3+4+5+6 9g 2 -ee- >3+4+5-6 a we + 6 + _ Y 5G \ + 5 6 IN _ +t 6 5 6 (?) Evaluate each expression and write the result next to it. Do you notice anything interesting? (?) Now, take four other consecutive numbers. Place the + and ~ signs as you have done before. Find out the results of each expression. What do you observe? ae. (?) Repeat this for one more set of 4 consecutive numbers. Share your Math I findings. 3+4-5+6=8 5+6-7+8=12 3-4-5-6 =-12 5-6-7-8 =-16 Some sums appear always no matter which 4 consecutive numbers are chosen. Isn t that interesting? (?) Do these patterns occur no matter which 4 consecutive numbers are chosen? Is there a way to find out through reasoning? Hint: Use algebra and describe the 8 expressions in a general form. You might have noticed that the results of all expressions are even numbers. Even numbers have a factor of 2. Negative numbers having a factor 2 are also even numbers, for example, 2, 4, 6, and so on. Check if anyone in your class got an odd number. When 4 consecutive numbers are chosen, no matter how the + and signs are placed between them, the resulting expressions always have even parity. . Chapter 5 Letter Number Play 06-07-2025.indd 113 = 10-07-2025 15:07:57 Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 Now take any 4 numbers, place + and ~ signs in the eight different ways, and evaluate the resulting expression. What do you observe about their parities? Repeat this with other sets of 4 numbers. ge. (?) Is there a way to explain why this happens? Hint: Think of the rules for parity of the sum or difference of two numbers. Explanation 1: Let us consider any of the 8 expressions formed by
