(upon division by 9) would be 4. 427 has 2 tens, and its corresponding remainder would be 2. We have 7 units also remaining. Adding all the remainders, we get 4+ 2 + _7=13. We can make one more group of 9 with 13, leaving a remainder of 4. Therefore, 427 = 9 gives a remainder of 4. : (Remainder) Chapter 5 Letter Number Play 06-07-2025.indd 124 2 10-07-2025 15:07:59 Number Play (?) Will this work with bigger numbers? You can see that this is true for any place value: C9999) 1=0+1 C39 p 0 as 10000 = 9999 + 1, and so on. Each digit thus denotes the remainder when the corresponding place value is divided by 9. For example, to find the remainder of 7309 when divided by 9, we can just add all the digits 7 + 3 + 0 + 9 to get 19. This can be seen as follows: 7 x 1000 3 x 100 9x1 7x 999 3x 99 7 3 9 @ a8 @ ad @ oG @ qgao @ @ @ So, we need to just consider this part (Le., 7+3+9=19) This is a multiple of 9 7x 1000+3%x100+0x10+9x1 = 7x (999 +1) +3 (99+1)+0x(9+1)+9 x (0+1) =(7x999+3x99+0x9+9x0)+(7*1+3x1+0*1+9%x1) =(7 x 999 +3 x99+0x9+9x0)+(7+3+0+9). This is a multiple of 9 So, we need to just consider this part This means that the number 7309 is 19 more than some multiple of 9. The digits 1 and 9 can further be added to get 1 + 9 = 10. Now, we can say that 7309 is 10 more than a multiple of 9. And repeating this step for the number 10, we get the remainder to be 1 + 0 = 1, meaning 7309 is 1 more than a multiple of 9. Therefore, 7309 = 9 gives a remainder of 1. Anumber is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Also, we can add the digits of a number repeatedly till a single digit is obtained. This single digit is the remainder when the number is divided by 9. 2 Look at each of the following statements. Which are correct and why? (i) Ifa number is divisible by 9, then the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. e. & Chapter 5 Letter Number Play 06-07-2025.indd 125 10-07-2025 15:07:59 Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 (ii) Ifthe sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 9, then the number is divisible by 9. (iii) Ifa number is not divisible by 9, then the sum of its digits is not divisible by 9. (iv) Ifthe sum of the digits of a number is not divisible by 9, then the number is not divisible by 9. following procedures but about understanding why something =f, Learning maths is not just about knowing some shortcuts and works. 2 Figure it Out 1.
