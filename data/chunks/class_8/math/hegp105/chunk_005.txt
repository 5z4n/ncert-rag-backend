Ifanumber is divisible by 12, then the number is also divisible by all the factors of 12. Explanation with Algebra and Visualisation Examples A number divisible by 12m 12, 24, 36, 48, 12 is a multiple of 12. 108, 132. Factors of multiples of 12m 12 Factors of 24: 1, 12 will include factors =2x6xm 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, of 12. =3x4xm 24. A factor of 12 covers a row fully. Hence, it covers all multiples of 12 fully. SMOJ UL In general, if A is divisible by k, then A is divisible by all the factors of k. Hence, Statement 4 is always true. (?) 5.

Talk (?) 6. Ifa number is divisible by both 9 and 4, it must be divisible by 36. (?) 7. Ifanumber is divisible by both 6 and 4, it must be divisible by 24. In general, if A is divisible by k and A is also divisible by m, then A is divisible by the LCM of k and m. This is because A is a multiple of k and also a multiple of m, so A s prime factorisation should contain the prime factorisation of LCM (k, m). (?) 8. When you add an odd number to an even number we get a multiple of 6. We know that multiples of 6 are all even numbers. The sum of an odd number and an even number will be an odd number. Therefore, this statement is never true. We can also explain this algebraically. Suppose, (2n) + (2m + 1) = 6), where 2n is an even number, 2m+ 1is an odd number, and 6j is a multiple of 6. Then 2n+2m=6 -1 2(n+m)=6j-1 which means 2(n + m), which is an even number, should be equal to 6j - 1, which is an odd number. This is
