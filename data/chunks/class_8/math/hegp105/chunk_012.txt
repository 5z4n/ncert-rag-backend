Divisibility Shortcuts for Other Numbers 2 How can we find out if a number is divisible by 6? Will checking its divisibility by its factors 2 and 3 work? Use the shortcuts for 2 and 3 on these numbers and divide each number by 6 to verify 38, 225, 186, 64. ; m = bs : ~~ ? i Es es 4, , * - : i P sy = Kes | Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 2 How about checking divisibility by 24? Will checking the divisibility by its factors, 4 and 6, work? Why or why not? Determining divisibility by 24 by checking divisibility by 4 and by 6 does not work. For example, the number 12 is divisible by both 4 and 6, but not by 24. To check for the divisibility by 24, we can instead check for the divisibility by 3 and divisibility by 8. Explain using prime factorisation why checking divisibility by 3 and 8 works for checking divisibility by 24, but checking divisibility by 4 and 6 is not sufficient for checking divisibility by 24. There are such shortcuts to check divisibility by every number until 100, and for some numbers beyond 100. You may try to understand how these work after learning certain concepts in higher grades. Digital Roots Take a number. Add its digits repeatedly till you get a single-digit number. This single-digit number is called the digital root of the number. For example, the digital root of the number 489710 will be 2(4+8+9+74+1+0=29,2+9=11,1+1=2). What property do you think this digital root will have? Recall that we did this while finding the divisibility shortcut for 9. Between the numbers 600 and 700, which numbers have the digital root: (i) 5, (ii) 7, (iii) 3? |__ 6@, Math (?) Write the digital roots of any 12 consecutive numbers. What do you observe? : We saw that the digital root of multiples of 9 is always 9. Now, find the digital roots of some consecutive multiples of (i) 3, Gi) 4, and (iii) 6. (?) What are the digital roots of numbers that are 1 more than a multiple of 6? What do you notice? Try to explain the patterns noticed. (?) I m made of digits, each tiniest and odd, No shared ground with root #1 how odd! My digits count, their sum, my root All point to one bold number s pursuit The largest odd single-digit I proudly claim. What s my number? What s my name? Chapter 5 Letter Number Play 06-07-2025.indd 130 & 10-07-2025 15:08:00 Number Play Aryabhata II s (c. 950 CE) work Mahdasiddhanta, mentions the method of computing the digital root of anumber by repeatedly adding the digits till a single-digit number is obtained. This method is known to have been used to perform checks on calculations of arithmetic operations. 2 Figure it Out 1. The digital root of an 8-digit number is 5. What will be the digital root of 10 more than that number? 2.
