Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, China, and India. For example, the mathematicians Euclid (in geometric form) and Aryabhata (in algebraic form) used the distributive law in an implicit manner extensively in their mathematical and scientific works. The first explicit statement of the distributive property was given by Brahmagupta in his work Brahmasphutasiddhanta (Verse 12.55), who referred to the use of the property for multiplication as khanda-gunanam (multiplication by parts). His verse states, The multiplier is broken up into two or more parts whose sum is equal to it; the multiplicand is then multiplied by each of these and the results added . That is, if there are two parts, then using letter symbols this is equivalent to the identity (a + b) c=ac + bce. In the next verse (Verse 12.56), Brahmagupta further describes a method for doing fast multiplication using this distributive property, which we explore further in the next section. @ Figure it Out 1. Observe the multiplication grid below. Each number inside the grid is formed by multiplying two numbers. If the middle number of a 3 x 3 frame is given by the expression pq, as shown in the figure, write the expressions for the other numbers in the grid. 3x5/3x6|3%x7 Be lop) AY N =\\ So 5*5/5x*x6/5*7 Be ]w try o;]O};]oO \ = I Oo al p |B lwo fwolre |e de KR lols 1a IS TB Jo Iu eS S oO N COlI [a l[o]A [wo lr [ey BIN ]O 1B [GH Ia 1X I] 00 \ ro) Ble te Te Ife SN CIl1DI FIN [oOo NIN IN Te Ie fe oo 3S N ]B [eR ]o [um [Nm m fo fo tm JY [Nw Te [RB iN CIDIN J@OIBRIOITMR | a].

Find 3 examples where the product of two numbers remains (y+) unchanged when one of them is increased by 2 and the otheris \ Talk decreased by 4. 4, Expand (i) (a + ab - 3b ) (4 + b), and (ii) (4y + 7) (y + 11z- 3). 5. Expand (i) (a b) (a + Db), (ii) (a - b) (a + ab + b ) and (iii) (a - b)(a + a b + ab + b*), Do you see a pattern? What would be the next identity in the pattern that you see? Can you check it by expanding? Fast Multiplications Using the Distributive Property The distributive property can be used to come up with quick methods of multiplication when certain types of numbers are multiplied. When one of the numbers is 11, 101, 1001, ... 2 Use the following multiplications to find the product of a number
