Algebra can also be used to justify or prove claims and conjectures (like the many properties you saw in the previous chapter) and to solve problems of various kinds. Distributivity is a property relating multiplication and addition that is captured concisely using algebra. In this chapter, we explore different types of multiplication patterns and show how they can be described in the language of algebra by making use of distributivity. 6.1 Some Properties of Multiplication Increments in Products Consider the multiplication of two numbers, say, 23 x 27. 2 1. By how much does the product increase if the first number (23) is increased by 1? (?) 2. What if the second number (27) is increased by 1? (?) 3. How about when both numbers are increased by 1? 2 Do you see a pattern that could help generalise our observations to the product of any two numbers? Let us first consider a simpler problem find the increase in the product when 27 is increased by 1. From the definition of multiplication (and the commutative property), it is clear that the product increases by 23. This can be seen from the distributive property of multiplication as well. If a,b and c are three numbers, then Chapter 6 We Distribute, Yet Things Multiply.indd 136 10-07-2025 15:10:48 en We Distribute, Yet Things Multiply a(b+c)=ab+ac This property can be visualised nicely using a diagram: b columns c columns a rows a(b+c) This is called the distributive property of multiplication over addition. Using the identity a (b + c) = ab + ac with a = 23, b = 27, and c= 1, we have (~V~ 23 (27 + 1) = 23 x 27 +23] Increase Remember that here, a (b + c) and 23 (27 + 1) mean a x (b + Cc), and 23 x (27 + 1), respectively. We usually skip writing the x symbol before or after brackets, just as in the case of expressions like 5a, xy, etc. We can also similarly expand (a + b) c using the distributive property as follows (a+ b) c=c (a+b) (commutativity of multiplication) = ca + cb (distributivity) = ac + bc (commutativity of multiplication) We can use the distributive property to find, in general, how much a product increases if one or both the numbers in the product are increased by 1. Suppose the initial two numbers are a and D. If one of the numbers, say b, is increased by 1, then we have (VV a(b+1)=ab~x [a] Increase Now let us see what happens if both numbers in a product are increased by 1. If in a product ab, both a and b are increased by 1, then we obtain (a
