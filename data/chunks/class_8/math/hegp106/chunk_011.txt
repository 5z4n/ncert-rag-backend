for the area of the dashed region in the figure (math * below. Use more than one method to arrive at the answer. Substitute Talk p=6,r=3.5, and s = 9, and calculate the area. _ @ Figure it Out 1. Compute these products using the suggested identity. (i) 46 using Identity 1A for (a + b) (ii) 397 x 403 using Identity 1C for (a + b) (a b) (iii) 91? using Identity 1B for (a - b) (iv) 43 x 45 using Identity 1C for (a + b) (a b) 2. Use either a suitable identity or the distributive property to find each of the following products. (i) (p-1) (p+ 11) (ii) (3a - 9b) (3a + 9b) (iii) -(2y + 5) (3y +4) (iv) (6x + Sy) (v) (2x-5) (vi) (7p) x (3r) x (p + 2) We Distribute, Yet Things Multiply 3. For each statement identify the appropriate algebraic expression(s). (i) Two more than a square number. 2+Ss (s + 2) s +2 s +4 2s* 2 s (ii) The sum of the squares of two consecutive numbers m+n (m +n) m+1 m + (m+ 1) m+(m-1)? (m+(m+1)) (2m) + (2m + 1)? 4. Consider any 2 by 2 square of numbers in a calendar, as shown in the figure. /su{ m {Tul w| th] F | sa] pt tt | | fa p2{si4a{slel7]s| 9 | 10] 11 | 12 | a3 [14 | 15 [23 | 24 | 25 | 26 | 27] 28] Find products of numbers lying along each diagonal 4 x 12 = 48, 5 x 11 = 55. Do this for the other 2 by 2 squares. What do you Math observe about the diagonal products? Explain why this happens. | 7,), Hint: Label the numbers in each 2 by 2 square as | a | a+) | 5. Verify which of the following statements are true. (i) (k+ 1) (K+ 2)-(k + 3) is always 2. (ii) (2q + 1) (2q-3) is a multiple of 4. (iii) Squares of even numbers are multiples of 4, and squares of odd numbers are 1 more than multiples of 8. (iv) (6n + 2)?-(4n + 3) is 5 less than a square number. 6. A number leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 7, and another number leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 7. What is the remainder when their sum, difference, and product are divided by 7? 7. Choose three consecutive numbers, square the middle one, and subtract the product of the other two. Repeat the same with other ~ Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 10. 11. sets of numbers. What pattern do you notice? How do we write this as an algebraic equation? Expand both sides of the equation to check that it is a true identity. . What is the algebraic expression describing the following steps add any two numbers. Multiply this by half of the sum of the two numbers? Prove that this result will be half
