b)(a + a b + ab + b*), Do you see a pattern? What would be the next identity in the pattern that you see? Can you check it by expanding? Fast Multiplications Using the Distributive Property The distributive property can be used to come up with quick methods of multiplication when certain types of numbers are multiplied. When one of the numbers is 11, 101, 1001, ... 2 Use the following multiplications to find the product of a number with 11 in a single step. (a) 3874 x 11 (b) 5678 x 11 Let us take the first multiplication. 3874 x 11 = 3874 (10 + 1) = 38740 + 3874 + 3874 Notice how the digits are getting added. Let us take a 4-digit number dcba, that is, the number that has din the thousands place, c in the hundreds place, b in the tens place and ain the units place. dcba x (10 + 1) = dcba x 10 + dcba. This becomes d Cc b a O + d Cc b a d (c+d) (b+c) (a+b) a ~ Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 This can be used to obtain the product in one line. Step 1 Step 2 Step 3 O, O a) ry 387@~x 11 3874 x 11 3874 x11 4 14 614 Step 4 Step 5 ma a0 3874 x 11 3874 x 11 2614 42614 2 Describe a general rule to multiply a number (of any number of digits) by 11 and write the product in one line. ) Evaluate (i) 94% 11, (i) 495* 11, (iii) 3279 x11, (iv) 4791256 11. 2 Can we come up with a similar rule for multiplying a number by 101? (?) Multiply 3874 by 101. Let us take a 4-digit number dcba. dcba x 101 = dcba x (100 + 1) = dcba x 100 + dcba. This becomes d c b a fe) fe) + d c b a d (a (b+da) (atc) Db a (?) Use this to multiply 3874 x 101 in one line. What could be a general rule to multiply a number by 101 and write the product in one line? Extend this rule for multiplication by 1001, 10001, ... ea , (?) Use this to find (i) 89 = 101, (ii) 949 x 101, (iii) 265831 x 1001, (iv) 1111 x 1001, (v) 9734 x 99 and (vi) 23478 x 999. 4 Such methods of applying the distributive property to easily multiply two numbers were discussed extensively in the _ ancient mathematical works of Brahmagupta (628 CE), Sridharacharya (750 CE) and Bhaskaracharya (Lilavati, 1150 CE). In his work Brahmasphutasiddhanta (Verse 12.56), Brahmagupta refers to such methods for fast multiplication using the distributive property as ista-gunana. We Distribute, Yet Things Multiply Bey 6.2 Special Cases of the Distributive Property Square of the Sum/Difference of Two Numbers 2 The area of a square of sidelength 60 units is 3600 sq. units (607) and that of a square of sidelength 5 units is
