gives the number of circles at Step k of this pattern. In Mathematics, there are often multiple ways of looking at a pattern, and different ways of approaching and solving the same problem. Finding such ways often requires a great deal of creativity and imagination! While one or two of the ways might be your favourite(s), it can be amusing and enriching to explore other ways as well. 2 Use this formula to find the number of circles in Step 15. 2 Consider the pattern made of square tiles in the picture below. 1 2 3 We Distribute, Yet Things Multiply 2 How many square tiles are there in each figure? (?) How many are there in Step 4 of the sequence? What about Step 10? Share your methods with the class. Can you find more than one Write an algebraic expression for the number of tiles in Step n. /yy54) 8 Talk method to arrive at the answer? 2 Find the area of the (interior) shaded region in the figure below. All four & rectangles have the same dimensions. Tadang s method: The total region is a square of side (m + n) with an area IN (m+n). Subtracting the area of four rectangles from the total h area will give the area of the interior shaded region. That is, (m+n)*- 4mn. Ro Yusuf s method: The shaded region is a square with sidelength (n - m). So, its area is (n-m) . (?) By expanding both expressions, check that (m + n)? 4mn = (n= m/). Find out the area of the region with slanting lines in the figure. All three rectangles have the same dimensions (Fig. 1). Anusha s method: Required area = Area (ABCD) Area (EFGH) Area of ABCD = x . Area of EFGH = xy. Required area = x xy. Vaishnavi s method: QS=y+xty =x + 2y. Area of PQSR = x (x + 2y) arly Required area = Area of PQSR - (area of the three rectangles) = X (X + 2y) - 3xy. Pe e Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 Aditya s method: The required area is 2 times the area of JKLM. X-y JK= 2 , KM=x Area (JKML) = x ( 37) Required area = 2 x Area of JKML = x - y ax (~5) =X (x-y). (?) By expanding the expressions, verify that all three expressions are equivalent. If x = 8 and y = 3, find the area of the shaded region. ae, 2 Write an expression for the area of the dashed region in the figure (math * below. Use more than one method to arrive at the answer. Substitute Talk p=6,r=3.5, and s = 9, and calculate the area. _ @ Figure it Out 1. Compute these products using the suggested identity.
