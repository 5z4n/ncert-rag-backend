are replaced by numbers. These We Distribute, Yet Things Multiply = numbers could be any integers. Mathematical statements that express the equality of two algebraic expressions, such as a (b+ 8)=ab+ 8a, (a+ 1)(b-1)=ab+b-a-1,etc., are called identities. 2 By how much will the product of two numbers change if one of the numbers is increased by m and the other by n? If a and b are the initial numbers being multiplied, they become a+mandb+n. (a+m (b+n=(a+mb+(at+mn =ab+mb+an+mn The increase is an + bm + mn. Notice that the product is the sum of the product of each term of (a + m) with each term of (b + n). This identity can be visualised as follows b columns n columns a rows m YOows (a+m) (b+n) ~ Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 2 This identity can be used to find how products change when the numbers being multiplied are increased or decreased by any amount. Can you see how this identity can be used when one or both numbers are decreased? For example, let us reconsider the case when one number is increased by 1 and the other decreased by 1. Let us write the product (a + 1) (b-1) as (a+ 1) (b + (-1). Taking m = 1 and n =-1 in Identity 1, we have ab + (1)xb+ax(-1)+ (1) x (1) =ab+b-a-1, which is the same expression that we obtain earlier. (?) Use Identity 1 to find how the product changes when (i) one number is decreased by 2 and the other increased by 3; (ii) both numbers are decreased, one by 3 and the other by 4. (?) Verify the answers by finding the products without converting the subtractions to additions. Generalising this, we can find the product (a + u) (b- v) as follows. (a+u)(b-v) =(a+tu)b-(at+wy = ab + ub-(av+ uv) =ab+ub-av-uv. Check that this is the same as taking m = u and n = -v in Identity 1. As in Identity 1, the product (a + u) (b- v) is the sum of the product of each term of a + u (a and u) with each term of b - v (b and (-v)). Notice that the signs of the terms in the products can be determined using the usual rules of integer multiplication. See how the rules of integer multiplication allows us to handle multiple cases using a single identity! 2 Expand (i) (a-u) (b + v), Gi) (a-u) (b-v). We get (a u) (b+ v)=ab-ub+av-uwvy, and (a u) (b- v) =ab-ub-av+wy. The distributive property is not restricted to two terms within a bracket. 2 Example 1: Expand a (a- b+ 3). F(a-b+ 5) = x a- Ex b) + xs). The terms can be simplified as follows 32x q=3x (axa).
