at the following pattern. 2(22+1%)=3?+1? 2 (3 + 1 ) = 4 + 2? 2 (6? + 5 ) = 117 + 1 2 (8? + 3%) = 87+ 2% ~ Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 2 Take a pair of natural numbers. Calculate the sum of their squares. Can you write twice this sum as a sum of two squares? Try this with other pairs of numbers. Have you figured out a pattern? Notice that 2 (5 + 6 ) = (6+ 5)? + (6-5) . Do the identities below help in explaining the observed pattern? (a+b) =a +2ab+ b* (a b) = a - 2ab + b* (a+ b) + (a b) = (a + 2ab + b ) + (a - 2ab + b ) Adding the like terms a + a = 2a , b + b = 2b and 2ab 2ab = 0, we get 2 (a + b ) = (a+b)? + (a b) . Pattern 2 2 Here is a related pattern. Try to describe the pattern using algebra to determine if the pattern always holds. 9x9-1x1=10x8 8x8-6x6=14x2 7x7-2x2=9x5 10x10-4x4=14x6 The pattern here appears to be a b = (a + b) x (a b). Is this a true identity? Using the distributive property, we get (a+b) x (a b) = a -ab+ ba- a . Adding the like terms, ab + ( ab) = 0, we see that indeed You had seen this identity earlier in Figure it Out 5 (i). 2 Use Identity 1C to calculate 98 x 102, and 45 x 55. 2 Show that (a + b) x (a b) = a - b geometrically. We Distribute, Yet Things Multiply a ee Hint: ' x)> What do we get when this piece is moved? Sridharacharya (750 CE) gave an interesting method to quickly compute the squares of numbers using Identity 1C! Consider the following modified form of this identity a =(a+b)(a b)+ b* 2 Why is this identity true? Now, for example, 31 can be found by taking a = 31 and b = 1. 31? = (31 + 1) (31-1) +1? = 32 x 30+1 = 961. 197 can be found by taking a = 197, and b = 3. 197 = (197 + 3) (197 3) + 3 = 200 x 194 +9 = 38809. @ Figure it Out 1. Which is greater: (a b) or (b a) ? Justify your answer. 2. Express 100 as the difference of two squares. 3. Find 406 , 72 , 145 , 1097 , and 124 using the identities you have learnt so far. Talk | 4. Do Patterns 1 and 2 hold only for counting numbers? Do they hold for negative integers as well? What about fractions? Justify your answer. 6.3 Mind the Mistake, Mend the Mistake We have expanded and simplified some algebraic expressions below to their simplest forms. (i) Check each of the simplifications and see if there is a mistake. (ii) If there is a mistake,
