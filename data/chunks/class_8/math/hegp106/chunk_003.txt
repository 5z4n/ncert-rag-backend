v) =ab-ub-av+wy. The distributive property is not restricted to two terms within a bracket. 2 Example 1: Expand a (a- b+ 3). F(a-b+ 5) = x a- Ex b) + xs). The terms can be simplified as follows 32x q=3x (axa). Yet Things Multiply < We Distribute, Using exponent notation, we can write 7 x(axa)= 7 a . 3ay p= 3 -3 3a, 1_(3y,1),-3 7 Xs=Gx5)a=794a So we get 34 (g_p+4)=3q2-3 =e 7 (a-b+<s)=5a-5ab+75 a. (?) Can any two terms be added to get a single term? For example, can 7 a and sy a be added to get a single term? We see that no two terms have exactly the same letter-numbers, which would have allowed them to be simplified into a single term. So, a further simplification of the expression is not possible. Recall that we call terms having the same letter-numbers like terms. 2 Example 2: Expand (a + b) (a + b). We have (a+ b) (a+ b) = (a+b) at (a+ b)b=axat+bxa+ab+bxb =a + ba+ab+b? Since ba = ab, we have two terms having the same letter-numbers ab (or, that are like terms), and so can be added ba + ab = ab + ab = 2ab So we get (a+ b) (a+ b) =a + 2ab + b . 2 Example 3: Expand (a + b) (a* + 2ab + b ). (a + b) (a*+ 2ab + b*) = (a+ b)a*+ (a+ b) x 2ab + (a+ b)b = (a x a ) + ba + (a x 2ab) + (b x 2ab) + ab*+ (b x b ) The terms can be simplified as follows a x a = a (why?) ba = a b ax 2ab=2xaxaxb=2a b bx 2ab=2xaxbxb=2ab* bx b*=b So, (a + b)(a? + 2ab + b ) = a + a b + 2a b + 2ab + ab + b . We see that a*b and 2a b have the same letter-numbers (or, are like terms) and so can be added - Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 ab + 2a b = (1+ 2) a b = 3a b. Similarly, ab* and 2ab are like terms and so can be added ab + 2ab = (1 + 2)ab* = 3ab . Thus, we have (a + b) x (a? + 2ab +b ) = a3 + 3a b + 3ab + b?. A Pinch of History The distributive property of multiplication over addition was implicit in the calculations of mathematicians in many ancient civilisations, particularly in ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, China, and India. For example, the mathematicians Euclid (in geometric form) and Aryabhata (in algebraic form) used the distributive law in an implicit manner extensively in their mathematical and scientific works. The first explicit statement of the distributive property was given by Brahmagupta in his work Brahmasphutasiddhanta (Verse 12.55), who referred to the use of the property for multiplication as khanda-gunanam (multiplication by parts). His verse states, The multiplier is broken up into two or more parts
