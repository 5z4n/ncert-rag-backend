If you have difficulty remembering or using the general rule, you can just apply the distributive property to multiply and get the Expand (3j + 2k) using both the identity and by applying the distributive 2 Can we use 60 (=3600) and 5 (=25) to find the value of (60 5) or 55 ? Let us approach this through geometry by drawing a square of side length 55 sitting inside a square of sidelength 60. Area of a square of sidelength 55 is (60 - 5)? = 55 . 60 55 60x60 -5~x 60 We can get the area of the square of sidelength 55 by taking the area of the square of sidelength 60 and removing the areas of the two rectangles of sidelengths 60 and 5, i.e., 60 - (60 x 5) - (5 x 60). By doing this, we remove the area of the small square of sidelength 5 twice. What can we do with this expression to get the actual area? We can add back the area of the square of sidelength 5 to this expression. That way, we are only subtracting this area once. So, (60 5)* = 60 - (60 x 5) (5 x 60) + 5? = 3600 300 - 300 + 25 = 3025. The area of the square of sidelength 55 is 3025 sq. units. We have seen what (a + b)* gives when expanded. What is the expansion of (a b) ? Using the distributive property, (a b) = (a b) x (a-b) = (a) ba ab + (by =a -2ab +b . 2 We can also use the expansion of (a + b)* to find the expansion of (a b) . Think how. Hint: (a b)* = (a + (-b)) . We can now directly use the expansion of (a + b) . (a + (-b) = (a) + (-b) + 2 x (a) xD) 2 Find the general expansion of (a b) using geometry, as we did for 55 . 2 Use the identity (a b) to find the values of (a) 99 and (b) 58 . 2 Expand the following using both Identity 1B and by applying the distributive property (i) (b- 6) (ii) (2a + 3) Gii) Wy - By Investigating Patterns Pattern 1 Look at the following pattern. 2(22+1%)=3?+1? 2 (3 + 1 ) = 4 + 2? 2 (6? + 5 ) = 117 + 1 2 (8? + 3%) = 87+ 2% ~ Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 2 Take a pair of natural numbers.
