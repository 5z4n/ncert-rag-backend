ancient mathematical works of Brahmagupta (628 CE), Sridharacharya (750 CE) and Bhaskaracharya (Lilavati, 1150 CE). In his work Brahmasphutasiddhanta (Verse 12.56), Brahmagupta refers to such methods for fast multiplication using the distributive property as ista-gunana. We Distribute, Yet Things Multiply Bey 6.2 Special Cases of the Distributive Property Square of the Sum/Difference of Two Numbers 2 The area of a square of sidelength 60 units is 3600 sq. units (607) and that of a square of sidelength 5 units is 25 sq. units (5 ). Can we use this to find the area of a square of sidelength 65 units? A square of sidelength 65 can be split into 4 regions as shown in the figure a square of sidelength 60, a square of sidelength 5, and two rectangles of sidelengths 60 and 5. The area of the square of sidelength 65 is the sum of the areas of all its constituent parts. Can you find the areas of the four parts in the figure above? 60 5 We get 65 = (60 + 5) = 607 + 5*+ 2 x (60 x 5). = 3600 + 25 + 600 = 4225 sq. units. Let us multiply (60 + 5) x (60 + 5) using the distributive property. 60 (60 + 5) x (60 +5) = 60 x 60+5x60+60x5+5%x5 = 60 + 2 x (60 x 5) +57. What if we write 65 as (30 + 35) or (52 + 13)? 5 Draw the figures and check the area that you get. ; Let us look at the general expression for the square of sum of two numbers, (a + b) . a b ! Using the distributive property, (a+b)? can be expanded as (a+b) x (a+b) = axa + axb + bxa + bxb = a + 2ab + b , as we had already seen in Example 2. a) a a as 2 If a and b are any two integers, is (a + b)* always greater than Math ' 2. 12 oe Talk a + b*?

Using the Distributive Property (6x +5)* =(6x +5) (6x+5) = (6x x 6x) + (5 x 6x) +(6x x 5) +55 = (6x)* + 2 (6x x 5) + 52 = 36x + 60x + 25. 2 Use Identity 1A to write the expressions for the following.

If you have difficulty remembering or using the general rule, you can just apply the distributive property to multiply and get the Expand (3j + 2k) using both the identity and by applying the distributive 2 Can we use
