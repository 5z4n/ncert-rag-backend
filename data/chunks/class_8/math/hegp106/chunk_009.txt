145 , 1097 , and 124 using the identities you have learnt so far. Talk | 4. Do Patterns 1 and 2 hold only for counting numbers? Do they hold for negative integers as well? What about fractions? Justify your answer. 6.3 Mind the Mistake, Mend the Mistake We have expanded and simplified some algebraic expressions below to their simplest forms. (i) Check each of the simplifications and see if there is a mistake. (ii) If there is a mistake, try to explain what could have gone wrong. (iii) Then write the correct expression. =p-2q (5m + 6n)? = 25m? + 36n? F (10s - 6) +3 =5s-3+3 =5s 6.4 This Way or That Way, All Ways Lead to the Bay Observe the pattern in the figure below. Draw the next figure in the sequence. How many circles does it have? How many total circles are there in Step 10? Write an expression for the number of circles in Step k. There are many ways of interpreting this pattern. Here are some 3p (Sp + 2q) = 3p + Sp-2q (x + 2)(x + 5) = (x + 2)x + (X+ 2)5 = x*+2x+5x +10 = x*+ 7x +10 2(x-1)+3( +4) =2x-1+3x+4 =5x+3 5w?+ 6W = 11 (a+2)(b+4) =ab+8 yt 2(y +2) =(y +2)? =y +4y+4 3a (2b x 3c) = 6ab x 9ac = 54a2bc 2a + 3a + 6a2b + 6ab* = 5a + 12a b? ab*+ a b + a b? =ab(a+b-+ab) Method 1 Step 1 Step 2 Step 3 Step 4 $3 ( . ) 27-1 3 -1 4-1 =(1+1)-1 =(2+1)?-1 =(3+1)-1 =(4+1)?-1 Method 2 Step 1 Step 2 Step 3 Step 4 1+2x1 22+2%*2 37+2x3 =1?+2x1 =2?+2x2 =37+2x3 =4+2x4 Method 3 Step 1 Step 2 Step 3 Step 4 1x2+1 2x3+2 3x4+3 4x5+4 =1x(1+1)+1 =2x(2+1)+2 =3x(8+1)+3 =4x(4+1)+4 We Distribute, Yet Things Multiply | 2 ea Step k (k+1)?-1 Step k R+2xk Step k kx(k+1)+k Method 4 Step 1 Step 2 Step 3 Step 4 Lee Step k 1x3 2x4 3x5 =1x(+2) =2x(2+2) =3x(8+2) k x (k+2) Does your method match any of these, or is it different? Each expression that we have identified appears different, but are they really different? Since they describe the same pattern, they should all be the same. Let us simplify each expression and find out. (k+1) -1 ke+2xk kx(k+1)+k kx(k+2) =k +1+2k-1 =k +2k =k+k+k =k +2k =k? +2k =k +2k When carried out correctly, all methods lead to the same answer; k + 2k. The expression k + 2k gives the number of circles at Step k of this pattern. In Mathematics, there are often multiple ways of looking at a pattern, and different ways of approaching and solving the same problem. Finding such ways often requires a great deal of creativity and imagination! While one or two of the ways might be your favourite(s), it can be amusing and enriching to explore other ways as well. 2 Use this formula to find the number of circles in Step
