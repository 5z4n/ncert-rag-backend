in general, how much a product increases if one or both the numbers in the product are increased by 1. Suppose the initial two numbers are a and D. If one of the numbers, say b, is increased by 1, then we have (VV a(b+1)=ab~x [a] Increase Now let us see what happens if both numbers in a product are increased by 1. If in a product ab, both a and b are increased by 1, then we obtain (a + 1) (b+ 1). ~ Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 2 How do we expand this? Let us consider (a + 1) as a single term. Then, by the distributive property, we have (a+ 1)(b+1)=(a+1)b+(a+1)1 Again applying the distributive property, we obtain If a = 23, and, b = 27, we get ( (Ww (RY @+norn-dofbeGetr (23 + 1) (27+ 1) = (23 +1) 27+ (23+) 1 ab +[6+a+D) -2327+[@7+23+D)| Increase Increase Thus, the product ab increases by a+ b + 1 when each of a and b are increased by 1. (?) What would we get if we had expanded (a+ 1) (b + 1) by first taking (b + 1) as a Single term? Try it? 2 What happens when one of the numbers in a product is increased by 1 and the other is decreased by 1? Will there be any change in the product? Let us again take the product ab of two numbers a and D. If a is increased by 1 and b is decreased by 1, then their product will be (a + 1) (b - 1). Expanding this, we get If a = 23, and b = 27, we get (a+ 1) (b-1) =(at+1)b-(a+1)1] (23+ 1) (27-1) = (23 + 1) 27-(23+1)1 =ab+ b-(a+1) = 23 x 27+27-(23 +1) = ab +[b-a-1] = 23x 27+[27- 23-1 Increase Increase Will the product always increase? Find 3 examples where the product decreases. (?) What happens when a and D are negative integers? Check by substituting different values for a and b in each of the above cases. For example, a =-5, b = 8; a=-4, b =-5; etc. We have seen that integers also satisfy the distributive property, that is, if x, yand z are any three integers, then x (y + Z) = xy + xz. Thus, the expressions we have for increase of products hold when the letter-numbers take on negative integer values as well. Recall that two algebraic expressions are equal if they take on the same values when their letter-numbers are replaced by numbers. These We Distribute, Yet Things Multiply = numbers could be any integers. Mathematical statements that express the equality of two algebraic expressions, such as a (b+ 8)=ab+ 8a, (a+ 1)(b-1)=ab+b-a-1,etc., are called identities. 2 By how much will the product of two numbers change if one of the numbers is increased by m and the other by n? If a and b are the initial numbers being multiplied, they become a+mandb+n. (a+m (b+n=(a+mb+(at+mn =ab+mb+an+mn The increase
