they are all powers of 10. The following are the symbols given to these numbers 1 10 10 10 104 10 10 10 XN 24 Tals Tn ae CS es oN As in the case of Roman numbers, a given number is counted in groups of the landmark numbers, starting from the largest landmark number less than the given number. This is then used to assign the numeral. For example 324 which equals 100 + 100 + 100 + 10 + 10 + 4 is written as 999 (1 Ill. @ Figure it Out 1. Represent the following numbers in the Egyptian system: 10458, 1023, 2660, 784, 1111, 70707. 2. What numbers do these numerals stand for? (i) a ae (ii) eae area Taka Wha II. Variations on the Egyptian System and the Notion of Base 2 Instead of grouping together 10 collections of size equal to the previous landmark number (as in the case of the Egyptian system), can we get a number system by grouping together 5 collections of size equal to the previous landmark number? Can this 5 be replaced by any positive integer? Let us examine this possibility. Let 1 be the first landmark number. Group together 5 collections of size equal to the previous landmark number (1). Its size is the second landmark number which is 5. Group together 5 collections of size equal to the previous landmark number (5). Its size is the third landmark number which is 5 x 5 = 25. Group together 5 collections of size equal to the previous landmark number (5). Its size is the fourth landmark number which is 5 x 25 = 125. Thus, we have a new number system where each landmark number is 5 times the previous one. Since 1 is the first landmark number, they are all powers of 5. 5 =1 51=5 57=25 53= 125 5*= 625 5 = 3125 A [ C) ~~ T 2 Express the number 143 in this new system. Let us start grouping, starting with the size 5 = 125, as this is the largest landmark number smaller than 143. We get 143 =125+5+5+5+1+1+1. So the number 143 in the new system is()[_][ J, JAA /. Number systems having landmark numbers in which the (a) first landmark number is 1, and (b) every next landmark number is obtained by multiplying the current landmark number by some fixed number n is said to be a base-n number system. The Egyptian number system is a base-10 system, and the number system that we created is a base-5 system. A base-10 number system is also called a decimal number system. @ Figure it Out 1. Write the following numbers in the above base-5 system using the symbols in Table 2: 15, 50, 137, 293, 651. 2. Is there a number that cannot be represented in our base-5 system above? Why or why not? 3. Compute the landmark numbers of a base-7 system. In general, what are the landmark numbers of a
