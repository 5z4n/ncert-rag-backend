For the same reason that it holds for (a + b) x n, it also holds when one of the numbers has more than 2 terms. For example, (a+ b+c)xn= an+bn+ cn.

As has been seen, a process of multiplying two numbers involves the multiplication of landmark numbers. When the landmark numbers are powers of a number, then their product is another landmark number. This fact simplifies the process of multiplication. However, this is not the case with the Roman numerals, which is why multiplication using them is difficult. Thus, a number system whose landmark numbers are powers of a number, i.e., a number system with a base, is efficient not only in number representation but also in its utility in carrying out arithmetic operations. The idea of a number system with a base was a turning point in the history of the evolution of number systems. Our modern Hindu number system is built on this structure. Abacus that Makes Use of the Decimal System In around the 11th century, even the people still using the Roman numerals started using a calculating device the abacus constructed using a decimal system. It was a board with lines, as shown in the Fig. 3.1. Starting from the line that stood for 1, each successive line stood for a successive power of 10. Fig. 3.1: Abacus Numbers were represented in it as follows: the given number was first grouped into the landmark numbers (powers of 10), in exactly the same way we have been grouping them so far. For each power of 10, as many counters were placed on its line as the number of times it occurred = AStory of
