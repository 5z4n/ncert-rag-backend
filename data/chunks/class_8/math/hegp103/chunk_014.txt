Note that when a number is grouped into powers of 60 for its representation, no power of 60 can occur 60 or more times. If this happens, then 60 of them can be grouped to form the next power of 60. For example, consider the expression (1) x 3600 + (70) x 60 +2 =(1) x 60 + (60+ 10) x 60+ 2 = (1) x 60 + 607+ (10) x 60 + 2 = (2) x 60 + (10) x 60 + 2 Therefore, any number can be represented using the numerals from 1-59, along with the numerals for landmark numbers. Now, what if we make the representation even more compact by dropping the symbols for the different powers of 60 altogether? 640 7530 ottinn | <OE |WOHOK Our aie | OS | oa Wee This is exactly what the Mesopotamians did! In their numeral, the rightmost set of symbols showed the number of 1s, the set of symbols to its left showed the number of 60s, the next showed the number of 3600s and so on. Whenever there was no occurrence of a power of 60, a blank space was given in that position. It does not seem that the Mesopotamians arrived at this idea in the same way we did. Some scholars suggest that the similarity of symbols given to the landmark numbers 1 and 60 in their earlier number system, and an accidental usage of them, might have made them stumble upon this idea. @ Figure it Out 1. Represent the following numbers in the Mesopotamian system (i) 63 (ii) 132 (iii) 200 = (iv)60 =v) 3605 Thus, we can see how the Mesopotamian system removes the need for generating an unending sequence of symbols for the landmark numbers by making use of the positions where the symbols are written. Such a number system (having a base) that makes use of the position of each symbol in determining the landmark number that it is associated with is called a positional number system or a place value system. This idea of place value marks the highest point in the history of evolution of number systems, and gives a very elegant solution to the problem of representing the unending sequence of numbers using only a finite number of different symbols! The Mesopotamian system however cannot be considered a fully developed place value system. It has certain defects that lead to confusion while reading a number. Look at the representation of 60. What will be the representation for 3,600? While writing the numerals, the spacing between symbols was not given the way we are giving it here. It was also difficult to maintain a consistent spacing for blanks across different manuscripts written by different people. These created ambiguities. For example, consider the representations of the following numbers Numbers Our representation Mesopotamian representation A Story of Numbers Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 Because of the ambiguity in finding which symbols correspond to which powers of 60, the same numeral can
