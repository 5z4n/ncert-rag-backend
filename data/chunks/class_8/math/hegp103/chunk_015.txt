While writing the numerals, the spacing between symbols was not given the way we are giving it here. It was also difficult to maintain a consistent spacing for blanks across different manuscripts written by different people. These created ambiguities. For example, consider the representations of the following numbers Numbers Our representation Mesopotamian representation A Story of Numbers Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 Because of the ambiguity in finding which symbols correspond to which powers of 60, the same numeral can be read in different ways. Even in our representation which uses uniform spacing between symbols for different powers of 60, it is difficult to know the number of blanks between two sets of symbols, as in the representation of 36002. To address the issue arising out of blank spaces, the later Mesopotamians used a brilliant idea of assigning a placeholder symbol to denote a blank space. This is like the 0 (zero) we use in our system. Thus, zero the symbol that shows nothingness is indispensable as a placeholder in a place value system in which numbers are written in an unambiguous manner. Even with the problem arising out of blank spaces solved, other ambiguities still remained in the system. For example, the placeholder symbol was primarily used in the middle of numbers and not at the end; so they would not use it to represent a number like (what we would write as) 3600. II. The Mayan Number System aa Wy. ae a In Central America, there flourished a civilisation known as the Mayan civilisation that made great intellectual and cultural progress between the 3rd and 10th centuries CE. Among their intellectual achievements stands their place value system designed independently of those in Asia. They also made use of a placeholder symbol, for the modern-day 0 , that looked like a seashell. aan . EI Wee MAYAN NOMBER SYSTEM |. See Almost a base-20 system | Vee .

Why was their third landmark number 360 rather than 400? Some scholars feel that this might have something to do with their calendars. They used a dot @ for 1, and a bar for 5. These were used to denote numbers from 1 to 19. The symbols associated with different landmark numbers were written one below the other with the lowermost set of symbols corresponding to the number of 1s,
