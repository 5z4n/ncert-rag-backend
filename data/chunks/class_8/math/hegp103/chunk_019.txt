ones. m@ Anumber system whose landmark numbers are the powers of a number n is referred to as a base-n number system. Number systems having a base that make use of the position of a symbol in determining the landmark number that it is associated with are called positional number systems or place value systems. m Place value representations were used in the Mesopotamian (Babylonian), Mayan, Chinese and Indian civilisations. m Thesystem of numerals that we use throughout the world today is the Hindu number system (also sometimes called the Indian number system, or the Hindu-Arabic number system). It is a place value system with (usually) 10 digits, including the digit 0 which is treated on par with other digits. Due to its use of 0 as a number, the system enables the writing of all numbers unambiguously using just finitely many symbols, and also enables efficient computation. The system originated in India around 2000 years ago, and then spread across the world, and is considered one of human history s greatest inventions.
