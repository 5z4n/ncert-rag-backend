system that we created is a base-5 system. A base-10 number system is also called a decimal number system. @ Figure it Out 1. Write the following numbers in the above base-5 system using the symbols in Table 2: 15, 50, 137, 293, 651. 2. Is there a number that cannot be represented in our base-5 system above? Why or why not? 3. Compute the landmark numbers of a base-7 system. In general, what are the landmark numbers of a base-n system? The landmark numbers of a base-n number system are the powers of n starting from n = 1, n, n , n ,... ~"" Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 Advantages of a Base-n System What is the advantage of having landmark numbers that are all the powers of a number? To understand this, let us perform some arithmetic operations using them. 2 Example: Add the following Egyptian numerals: ANN II AAA II AN | ANN Il ANN III e lI Let us find the total number of | and and group them starting from the largest possible landmark number. It has a total of 15M and 15 |. Since 10/9 gives the next landmark number 9, the sum can be regrouped an Hl Sum = Hl a Hl AAN Il | A Story of Numbers Since 10| gives af, we have a AN : ANN aM sum= 2 AAA aM 2 ANNI @ Figure it Out 1. Add the following Egyptian numerals: (i) td ig 999 * and 999 HI gpa ANA Al (ii) NOAM and al HI AN 2. Add the following numerals that are in the base-5 system that we created: OOOLAA + OOOOH AA Remember that in this system, 5 times a landmark number gives the next one! I see a similarity in the method of adding numbers in the Egyptian and the Hindu system! anan) |W O \ 0) OO A @ 4\7 lil +5 (6 | + ANAND it + OO 10 3 9 nT OO Contrast the addition done in a base-n number system with that done in the Roman system. In the Roman system, the grouping and rearranging has to be done carefully as it is not always by the same size that each landmark number has to be grouped to get the next one. The advantage of anumber system with a base becomes more evident when we consider multiplication. 2 How to multiply two numbers in Egyptian numerals? Let us first consider the product of two landmark numbers. (?) 1. What is any landmark number multiplied by / (that is 10)? Find the following products OANA WON Wy P Q Ww F*N Each landmark number is a power of 10 and so multiplying it with 10 increases the power by 1, which is the next landmark number. (?) 2. What is any landmark number multiplied by 9 (107)? Find the following products anD w9D wy liO ww FO A Story of Numbers * (?) Find the following products Ne Gi)
