in the Fig. 3.1. Starting from the line that stood for 1, each successive line stood for a successive power of 10. Fig. 3.1: Abacus Numbers were represented in it as follows: the given number was first grouped into the landmark numbers (powers of 10), in exactly the same way we have been grouping them so far. For each power of 10, as many counters were placed on its line as the number of times it occurred = AStory of Numbers ~~ in the grouping. The presence of a counter above a line contributed a value of 5. For example let us take the number 3426. It can be grouped as 3426 = 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 10 + 10+ 1+1+ 1+1+1+1 This number was represented as shown in Fig. 3.1. Notice how the 6 ones are represented. To get an idea of how the abacus was used for calculations, let us consider a simple addition problem: 2907 + 43. The two numbers were taken on either side of the vertical partition. How would you use this to find the sum? The counters along each line were brought together. What is to be done if the total in a line exceeded 10? Hint: In this problem, the 7 ones and the 3 ones together make 10 ones which contributes a counter to the line representing 10s. III. Shortcomings of the Egyptian System Despite being a number system that enabled relatively efficient number representations for numbers till a crore (10 ), and relatively easy computations, the Egyptian system had a drawback. If larger and larger numbers needed to be represented, then there was a need for inventing an unending sequence of symbols for higher and higher powers of 10. Here we see the original challenge of number representation resurfacing in a different form! The next and the final idea in the history of the evolution of number systems not only solves this problem but also remarkably simplifies number representation and computations! @ Figure it Out 1. Can there be a number whose representation in Egyptian Math y numerals has one of the symbols occurring 10 or more times? a 2. Create your own number system of base 4, and represent ( Math numbers from 1 to 16. Ta 3. Give a simple rule to multiply a given number by 5 in the base-5 system that we created. 3.4. Place Value Representation I. The Mesopotamian Number System In the beginning, the number system used in ancient Mesopotamia had different symbols for different landmark numbers. In later times, it became a base-60 system, also called the sexagesimal system, with a very efficient number representation. It has puzzled many why they chose base 60. Different theories exist to explain this, ranging from the connection between 60 and the periods of some important events (like the length of their lunar month which had 30 days, or the time taken for the Sun to complete one
