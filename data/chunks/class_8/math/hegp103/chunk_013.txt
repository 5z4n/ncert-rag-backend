system used in ancient Mesopotamia had different symbols for different landmark numbers. In later times, it became a base-60 system, also called the sexagesimal system, with a very efficient number representation. It has puzzled many why they chose base 60. Different theories exist to explain this, ranging from the connection between 60 and the periods of some important events (like the length of their lunar month which had 30 days, or the time taken for the Sun to complete one revolution around the Earth when Earth is taken to be stationary), the ease of representing fractions (we will not go into this here), their earlier sequence of landmark numbers 1, 10, 60, 600, 3600, 36000,... getting reduced to only the powers of 60, and so on. The influence of the Mesopotamian sexagesimal system, also known as the Babylonian number system, can be seen even now in our units of time measurements 1 hour = 60 minutes and 1 minute = 60 seconds. This system used the symbol Y for 1 and < for 10. Let us now briefly pause on the study of their number system, and ideate on how one can build an efficient number system using the Mesopotamian features seen so far. AStory of Numbers ~~ Let us give our own symbols to their landmark numbers = 3600 = 216000 .. Note that we have actually used Indian numerals in creating these symbols. We could have invented our own symbols but for the sake of easy recall and use, we have chosen to take help of the familiar numerals 1, 2, 3,... Using Y and < numbers from 1 to 59 can be represented 1 2 3 4 5 6 Hi) 8 9 yr wm Uw F g qi iH 10 11 12 20 30 40 50 59 <a n & Reproduction of a Mesopotamian Tablet 2 Example: Let us represent the number 640 in this system. Grouping it into landmark numbers, we see that 640 = (10) x 60 + 40. If we use the Egyptian idea, this number would be represented using 10 <)s, and 40 would be represented using 4 &s. " " Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 2 Can we represent this more compactly? We can simply represent this number as KV which can be read as ten 60s and one 40, just as we have written in the equation. 2 Example: Let us try another number 7530. 7530 = (2) x3600 + (5) x 60 + 30 So, its representation would be HOOK Note that when a number is grouped into powers of 60 for its representation, no power of 60 can occur 60 or more times. If this happens, then 60 of them can be grouped to form the next power of 60. For example, consider the expression (1) x 3600 + (70) x 60 +2 =(1) x 60 + (60+ 10) x 60+ 2 = (1) x 60 + 607+ (10) x 60 + 2 = (2) x 60 + (10)
