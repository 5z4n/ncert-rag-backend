to formulate the question? No, because 150 is in minutes, but 4 is in hours. The second ratio should use the same units for time as the first ratio. Since 4 hours is 240 minutes, the right form is 150: 90:: 240: ? (?) How can you find the distance covered in 240 minutes? Discuss with your classmates and find the answer using different strategies. Note to the Teacher: Instead of giving one method to solve the problem of the distance, encourage students to reason out the answer through different strategies. They can use their understanding of equivalent fractions and equivalent ratios to find the answer. We can model this proportion as 150 : 90 :: 240: x. By cross multiplication, we get 150 x x = 240 x 90 240 x 90 x=: x Zz The distance covered by the car in 4 hours is 144 km. Therefore, Example 10: A small farmer in Himachal Pradesh sells each 200 g packet of tea for 200. A large estate in Meghalaya sells each 1 kg packet of tea for 800. Are the weight-to-price ratios in both places proportional? Which tea is more expensive? Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 The ratio of weight to price of the Himachal tea is 200 : 200. What is the weight to price ratio of the Meghalaya tea? Is it 1 : 800? This would not be appropriate, because we considered the weight in grams in the case of Himachal. So, the weight to price ratio is 1000 : 800 in Meghalaya after we convert the weight to grams. To check if the ratios are proportional, we need to see if both ratios are the same in their simplest forms. The Himachal tea ratio in its simplest form is 1: 1. The Meghalaya tea ratio in its simplest form is 5: 4. So, the ratios are not proportional. Which tea is more expensive? Why? , Note to the Teacher: Encourage a discussion on the more expensive tea, how they | 1 came to their conclusions and what the reasons for that tea being more expensive | , could be. To answer the question as to which tea is more expensive, we should compare the price of tea for the same weight in both places. What is the price of 1 kg of tea from Meghalaya? It is 800. In Himachal, if 200 g of tea costs rupees 200, what is the cost of 1 kg of tea? Let us say that the price of 1 kg of tea is x rupees. 200 g is t of 1 kg. So, 5x xX = 200. Multiplying both sides by 5, we get Fx xX*5 = 200% 5 $x * 5 = 1000 x = 1000. So, the cost of 1 kg of tea is 800 in Meghalaya and 1,000 in Himachal Pradesh. Therefore, the tea from Himachal Pradesh is more expensive. Activity 1: Take your favourite dish. Find out all the ingredients and their respective quantities needed
