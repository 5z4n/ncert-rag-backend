kg of tea is x rupees. 200 g is t of 1 kg. So, 5x xX = 200. Multiplying both sides by 5, we get Fx xX*5 = 200% 5 $x * 5 = 1000 x = 1000. So, the cost of 1 kg of tea is 800 in Meghalaya and 1,000 in Himachal Pradesh. Therefore, the tea from Himachal Pradesh is more expensive. Activity 1: Take your favourite dish. Find out all the ingredients and their respective quantities needed to make the dish for your family. Suppose you are celebrating a festival and you want to invite 15 guests. Find out the quantities of the ingredients required to cook the same dish for them. 2 Figure it Out 1. The Earth travels approximately 940 million kilometres around the Sun in a year. How many kilometres will it travel in a week? 2. Amason is building a house in the shape shown in the diagram. He needs to construct both the outer walls and the inner wall that Proportional Reasoning-1 separates two rooms. To build a wall of 10-feet, he requires approximately 1450 bricks. How many bricks would he need to build the house? Assume all walls are of the same height and thickness. 12 ft @ Puneeth s father went from Lucknow to Kanpur in 2 hours by riding his motorcycle at a speed of 50 km/h. If he drives at 75 km/h, how | 7,), long will it take him to reach Kanpur? Can we form this problem as a proportion 90:2::75:__ Would it take Puneeth s father more time or less time to reach Kanpur? Think about it. Even though this problem looks similar to the previous problems, it cannot be solved using the Rule of Three! The time of travel would actually decrease when the speed increases. So this problem cannot be modelled as 50: 2::75:_. 2 Activity 2: Go to the market and collect the prices of different sizes of shampoo containers of the same shampoo and create a table like the one given below. See if the volume of shampoo is proportional to the price. Container Volume Price 180 mL 154 340 mL 276 1000 mL Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 . Let us compare the ratios for the sample table above. The ratio of the volume of a sachet to a small bottle is 6 : 180. The ratio of their prices is 2 : 154. Are these ratios proportional? (?) Why do you think that the ratio of the prices is not proportional to the ratio of the volumes? and for customers. For reducing ecological footprint, what would you recommend to the company and to the customer? Does the same occur for other products? Make similar tables for other products in the market, capturing different prices for different measures of the same product, e.g., rice or atta (flour). ] | | Discuss the pros and cons of different size bottles for the company Gra) Talk Observe the products for which the prices
