Look at the following rectangles. Which rectangles are similar to each other? You can verify this by measuring the width and height using a scale and comparing their ratios. 5. Look at the following rectangle. Can you draw a smaller rectangle and a bigger rectangle with the same width to height ratio in your notebooks? Compare your rectangles with your classmates drawings. x J Are all of them the same? If they are different from yours, /4,,))"s can you think why? Are they wrong? 6. The following figure shows a small portion of a long brick wall with patterns made using coloured bricks. Each wall continues this pattern throughout the wall. What is the ratio of grey bricks to coloured bricks? Try to give the ratios in their simplest form. 0 i a a (b) Proportional Reasoning-1 7. Let us draw some human figures. Measure your friend s body the lengths of their head, torso, arms, and legs. Write the ratios as mentioned below head : torso torso : arms torso : legs Now, draw a figure with head, torso, arms, and legs with equivalent ratios as above.

On a rainy day, only 80 students came to school. How many kilograms of rice should the cook make so that the food is not wasted? The ratio of the number of students to the amount of rice needs to be proportional. So, 120: 15 :: 80: ? (?) What is the factor of change in the first term? We can find that by dividing the terms an = 5. The number of students is reduced by a factor of 4. On multiplying the weight of rice by the same factor, we get, 15 x= 10. So, the cook should make 10 kg of rice on that day. The situation above is a typical example of a problem where we need to use proportional reasoning to
