compared to image A? Are the factors the same? Images A, C, and D look similar because their widths and heights have changed by the same factor. We say that the changes to their widths and heights are proportional. Proportional Reasoning-1 7.2 Ratios We use the notion of a ratio to represent such proportional relationships in mathematics. We can say that the ratio of width to height of image A is 60 : 40. The numbers 60 and 40 are called the terms of the ratio. The ratio of width to height of image C is 30: 20, and that of image D is 90: 60. So, in image A, we can say that for every 60 mm of width, there are 40 mm of height. We can say that the ratios of width to height of images A, C, and D are proportional because the terms of these ratios change by the same factor. Let us see how. Image A 60: 40 Multiplying both the terms by i. we get 60x 5:40*5 which is 30 : 20, the ratio of width to height in image C. By what factor should we multiply the ratio 60 : 40 (image A) to get 90: 60 (image D)? Amore systematic way to compare whether the ratios are proportional is to reduce them to their simplest form and see if these simplest forms are the same. 7.3 Ratios in their Simplest Form We can reduce ratios to their simplest form by dividing the terms by their HCF. In image A, the terms are 60 and 40. What is the HCF of 60 and 40? It is 20. Dividing the terms by 20, we get the ratio of image A to be 3: 2 in its simplest form. The ratio of image D is 90 : 60. Dividing both terms by 30 (HCF of 90 and 60), we get the simplest form to be 3: 2. So the ratios of images A and D are proportional as well. What is the simplest form of the ratios of images B and E? The ratio of image B is 40 : 20; in its simplest form, it is 2 : 1. The ratio of image E is 60 : 60; in its simplest form, it is 1: 1. Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 | These ratios are not the same as 3: 2. So, we can say that the ratios of width to height of images B and E are not proportional to the ratios of images A, C, and D. When two ratios are the same in their simplest forms, we say that the ratios are in proportion, or that the ratios are proportional. We use the : symbol to indicate that they are proportional. So a:b::c:d indicates that the ratios a: b and c: dare proportional. Thus, 60 : 40:: 30: 20 and 60: 40:: 90: 60. 7.4 Problem Solving with Proportional Reasoning 2 Example 1: Are the ratios 3 : 4 and 72
