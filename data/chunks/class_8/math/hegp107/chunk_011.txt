Prashanti invested ~75,000 and Bhuvan invested 25,000. At the end of the first month, they gained a profit of 4,000. They decided that they would share the profit in the same ratio as that of their investment. What is each person s share of the profit? The ratio of their investment is 75000 : 25000. Reducing this ratio to its simplest form, we get 3: 1. 3 +1is 4 and dividing the profit of 4000 by 4, we get 1000. So, Prashanti s share is 3 x 1000 and Bhuvan s share is 1 x 1000. So, Prashanti would get 3,000 and Bhuvan would get 1,000 of the profit. 2 Example 12: A mixture of 40 kg contains sand and cement in the ratio oO (74 ratio of sand to cement 5: 2? < of 3: 1. How much cement should be added to the mixture to make the s io te Proportional Reasoning-1 Let us find the quantity of sand and cement in the original mixture. The ratio is 3: 1 and the total weight is 40 kg. . . 3 = So, the weight of sand is 3 * AO = 30 kg. The weight of cement is % : 7 x 40= 10 kg. The weight of sand is the same in the new mixture. It remains 30. But the new ratio of sand to cement is 5 : 2. So the question is, 5:2::30:? If the ratio is 5 : 2, then the second term is - times the first term. Since the new ratio is equivalent to 5 : 2, the second term in the new ratio should also be 2 times of 30. 2x 30 = 12. The new mixture should have 12 kg of cement if the ratio of sand to cement is to be 5: 2. There is 10 kg of cement already. So, we need to add 2 kg of cement to the original mixture. 2 Figure it Out 1. Divide %4,500 into two parts in the ratio 2: 3. 2. Inascience lab, acid and water are mixed in the ratio of 1:5 to make a solution. In a bottle that has 240 mL of the solution, how much acid and water does the solution contain? 3. Blue and yellow paints are mixed in the ratio of 3 : 5 to produce green paint. To produce 40 mL of green paint, how much of these two colours are needed? To make the paint a lighter shade of green, I added 20 mL of yellow to the mixture. What is the new ratio of blue and yellow in the paint? 4. To make soft idlis, you need to mix rice and urad dal in the ratio of 2 : 1. If you need 6 cups of this
