images A, C, and D. When two ratios are the same in their simplest forms, we say that the ratios are in proportion, or that the ratios are proportional. We use the : symbol to indicate that they are proportional. So a:b::c:d indicates that the ratios a: b and c: dare proportional. Thus, 60 : 40:: 30: 20 and 60: 40:: 90: 60. 7.4 Problem Solving with Proportional Reasoning 2 Example 1: Are the ratios 3 : 4 and 72 : 96 proportional? 3:4 is already in its simplest form. To find the simplest form of 72 : 96, we need to divide both terms by their HCF. (?) What is the HCF of 72 and 96? The HCF of 72 and 96 is 24. Dividing both terms by 24, we get 3: 4. Since both ratios in their simplest form are the same, they are proportional. Example 2: Kesang wanted to make lemonade for a celebration. She made 6 glasses of lemonade in a vessel and added 10 spoons of sugar to the drink. Her father expected more people to join the celebration. So he asked her to make 18 more glasses of lemonade. (?) To make the lemonade with the same sweetness, how many spoons of sugar should she add? To maintain the same sweetness, the ratio of the number of glasses of lemonade to the number of spoons of sugar should be proportional. For 6 glasses of lemonade, she added 10 spoons of sugar. The ratio of glasses of lemonade to spoons of sugar is 6: 10. If she needs to make 18 more glasses of lemonade, how many spoons of sugar should she use? We can model this problem as 6:10::18:? We know that each term in the ratio must change by the same factor, for the ratios to be proportional. (?) How can we find the factor of change in the ratio? The first term has increased from 6 to 18. To find the factor of change, we can divide 18 by 6 to get 3. Proportional Reasoning-1 The second term should also change by the same factor. When 10 increases by a factor of 3, it becomes 30. Thus, 6:10::18: 30. So, she should use 30 spoons of sugar to make 18 glasses of lemonade with the same sweetness as earlier. 2 Example 3: Nitin and Hari were constructing a compound wall around their house. Nitin was building the longer side, 60 ft in length, and Hari was building the shorter side, 40 ft in length. Nitin used 3 bags of cement but Hari used only 2 bags of cement. Nitin was worried that the wall Hari built would not be as strong as the wall he built because she used less cement. (?) Is Nitin correct in his thinking? In Nitin and Hari s case, we should compare the ratio of the length of the wall to the bags of cement used by each of them and see whether they are proportional. The
