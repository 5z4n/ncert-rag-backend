s age). In the simplest form, it is 1: 10. When Neelima is 12 years old (i.e., 9 years later), the ratio of their ages will be 12 : 39 (9 years later, her mother would be 39 years old). In the simplest form, it is 4: 13. When we add (or subtract) the same number from the terms of a ratio, the ratio changes and is not necessarily proportional to the original ratio. 2 Example 7: Fill in the missing numbers for the following ratios that are proportional to 14: 21. > 42 6: 2: In the first ratio, we don t know the first term. But the second term is 42. It is 2 times the second term of the ratio 14 : 21. So, the first term should also be 2 times 14 (the first term). Hence the proportional ratio is 28 : 42. x 2=? For the second ratio, the first term is 6. (?) What factor should we multiply 14 by to get 6? Can it -A2 be an integer? Or should it be a fraction? __ 14:21 We can model this as 14y = 6. So, y = & = 3. So, we need to multiply 21 (the second term of 14 : 21) also by the same factor 3. 21 x 3 is 9. So, the ratio is 6 : 9. In the third ratio, the first term is 2. We can see that when we divide 14 (the first term of 14 : 21) by 7 (HCF of 14 and 21) we get 2. If we divide 21 also by 7, we get 3. So, the ratio is 2 : 3. Filter Coffee! Filter coffee is a beverage made by mixing coffee decoction with milk. Manjunath usually mixes 15 mL of coffee decoction with 35 mL of milk to make one cup of filter coffee in his coffee shop. In this case, we can say that the ratio of coffee decoction to milk is 15 : 35. If customers want stronger filter coffee, Manjunath mixes 20 mL of decoction with 30 mL of ~ - milk. The ratio here is 20: 30. (164 Proportional Reasoning-1 e , (?) Why is this coffee stronger? And when they want lighter filter coffee, he mixes 10 mL of Talk coffee and 40 mL of milk, making the ratio 10: 40. Be, (?) Why is this coffee lighter? Math Talk The following table shows the different ratios in which Manjunath mixes coffee decoction with milk. Write in the last column if the coffee is stronger or lighter than the regular coffee.
