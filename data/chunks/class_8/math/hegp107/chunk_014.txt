are the terms in the ratio. Two ratios a : b and c : d are proportional (written a: b::c: d) if their terms change by the same factor, i.e., if ad = be. = If xis divided into two parts in the ratio m:n, then the quantity of the . xX . . xX first part is m x Th and the quantity of the second part is n x a Binairo Binairo, also known as Takuzu, is a logic puzzle with simple rules. Binairo is generally played on a square grid with no particular size. Some cells start out filled with two symbols: here horizontal and vertical lines. The rest of the cells are empty. The task is to fill cells in such a way that: 1. Each row and each column must contain an equal number of horizontal and vertical lines. 2. More than two horizontal or vertical lines can t be adjacent. 3. Each row is unique. Each column is unique. %) ss = 4 s ye" oa Chapter 7.indd 178 10-07-2025 15:14:33 Dot Grid Chapter 7.indd 179 10-07-2025 15:14:33 Dot Grid Chapter 7.indd 180 10-07-2025 15:14:33
