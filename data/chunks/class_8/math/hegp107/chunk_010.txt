4 counters left. 3. Your partner takes 3 more counters and you take 1 more counter. There are no more counters left. So, your partner gets 9 counters in total and you get 3 counters. When we divide 12 counters in the ratio of 3 : 1 between two people, one gets 9 counters and the other gets 3 counters. 12 fo The whole is 12 AN The whole is 4 (= 3 + 1) Sharing 12 . in the ratio 3:1 3 4 : ] and 12 is 3 times 4 i x3 C | | 3 eZ h 3 The parts are 3 times the ratio 3: 1 Now, if you want to share 42 counters between the two of you in the ratio of 4: 3, how will you do it? Using the same procedure would take a long time! There is a simpler way to share the whole with parts in a specified ratio. You need to divide 42 into groups such that your partner gets 4 groups and you get 3 groups. (?) What is the size of each group? If your partner gets 4 groups and you get 3 groups, the total number of groups is 7. So, the size of each group is 42 + 7 = 6. Multiplying the number of groups by the size of each group, your partner gets 24 counters and you get 18 counters, when you share 42 counters in the ratio of 4: 3. 42 < The whole is 42 ON Sharing 42 4 : B ~____The whole is 7 (= 4+ 3) in the ratio 4: 3 and 42 is 6 times 7 24 : 18 The parts are 6 times the ratio 4:3 In general, when we want to divide a quantity, say x, in the ratio m:n, we do the following: 1. We need to split x into groups such that it can be divided into two parts where the first part has m groups and the second part has n groups. 2. But what is the size of each group? This can be found out by dividing xX by the number of groups. The number of groups are m + n. So, the . . xX size of each group is 7 . 3. So, the first part has m x = , objects and the second part has n x ae A objects. Thus, if we want to divide a quantity x in the ratio of m: n, then the x x parts will be m x ~ and n x man We see that Xx nx x mx . mtn mtn mein. 2 Example 11: Prashanti and Bhuvan started a food cart business near their school. Prashanti invested ~75,000 and Bhuvan invested 25,000. At the end of the first month, they gained a profit of 4,000. They decided that they would share the profit in the same ratio as that of their investment. What is each person s share of the
