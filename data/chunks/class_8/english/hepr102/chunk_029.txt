As you listen, complete the sentences by filling in the blanks with one or two exact words or phrases you hear. Hello, everyone! Let me tell you about the Param Vir Chakra. It is one of the most prestigious awards in India and signifies the Wheel of the Ultimate Brave. This award is granted for exemplary bravery in the presence of the enemy. This means that this award is given to someone who shows extraordinary courage and bravery while fighting the enemy. The medal was instituted as a Gallantry Medal with retrospective effect from 15 August 1947 by Dr. Rajendra Prasad, the then President of India. The medal was designed by Mrs. Savitri Khanolkar, who drew inspiration from Sage Dadhichi, a Vedic rishi, who made the ultimate sacrifice by giving up his body so that the gods could create a deadly weapon called Vajra, or Thunderbolt, from his spine. The Param Vir Chakra is cast in bronze. At its centre, on a raised circle, is the State Emblem of India. Surrounding it are four replicas of Indra s Vajra, lined with lotus flowers. That, my dear friends, is the Param Vir Chakra, a true symbol of bravery. Thank you. Let us listen (refer to page 78) I You will listen to a woman read a special broadcast of the news.
