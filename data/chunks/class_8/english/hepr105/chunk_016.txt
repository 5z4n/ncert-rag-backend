Schrodinger, though unsuccessful, reflected her remarkable talent. Her life, full of challenges and struggles, was marked by an uphill battle to be heard and seen in the field of science. Chowdhuri never received any awards during her lifetime, but continued her work tirelessly. notable: remarkable In 1949, upon her return to India, she became the first woman faculty member at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), personally selected by Homi J. Bhabha. Chowdhuri s contributions spanned across research institutes like the Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad and the Saha Y/ Institute of Nuclear Physics in Kolkata. This is where she continued her work on cosmic rays and subatomic particles. Through decades of crucial research, from Kolar Gold Mines to the Physical Research Laboratory under the mentorship of Vikram Sarabhai, Bibha s work went on quietly, as she ipherv: ; 3 age . periphery: remained in the periphery of Indian scientific acclaim. joundary She passed away in 1991, her story untold, her name largely forgotten. acclaim: praise The Legacy of Bibha Chowdhuri and Today s Women in Indian Science The stars are not meant to remain hidden forever. In 2019, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) honoured her legacy by renaming a Star in the constellation Leo HD 86081 as Bibha, meaning beam of light. Fittingly, she is now a star in heaven, a symbol of the light she brought to Indian science.

In 2020, the Government of India declared a chair professorship in her name. Fast forward to the present day, and the advancements made by women in Indian science reflect Chowdhuri s pioneering spirit and the progress she helped ignite. Women in ISRO, for instance, are no longer participants but leaders in missions that make global headlines. One such luminary is Dr. Ritu Karidhal Srivastava, popularly referred to as the Rocket Woman of India. Her pivotal role in ISRO s Mars Orbiter Mission and subsequent leadership in Chandrayaan-2 and Chandrayaan-3 reflect the leaps women have made in STEM in India. Over 50 women contributed to Chandrayaan-3, and their success is built upon the shoulders of pioneers like Bibha Chowdhuri. Their roles in developing autonomous systems for spacecraft and managing mission-critical operations highlight the capabilities of women in pushing India s space programme forward. From Shadows to the Stars The journey from Bibha Chowdhuri s era to today s women scientists has been long and arduous, but it is also inspiring. The struggles Chowdhuri faced are a stark reminder of how far we ve come and how much further we have to go. But with every cosmic achievement be it landing on the moon or reaching Mars these women prove that the journey is well worth it.
