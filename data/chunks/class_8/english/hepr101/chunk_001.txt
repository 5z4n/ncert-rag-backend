quarrel with his queen, Thirumalambal, over a seemingly trivial matter. For weeks, he did not utter a single word to her, and in his frustration, stopped visiting her altogether. His absence cast a shadow over the palace, and the once cheerful corridors seemed quiet and forlorn. Thirumalambal, distraught and upset, tried her best to resolve the issue but failed. With no other alternative, she decided to seek the help of Tenali Rama, the court s brilliant and witty poet. Rama listened patiently as the queen recounted the incident in detail. The king wrote a poem, she began, her voice trembling. It was filled with vague expressions sun, moon, stars, beautiful sky but it made no sense.

The court discussion was centred on improving paddy cultivation in the empire. One by one, the ministers rose to present their ideas. Some suggested expanding irrigation networks, while others advocated for better manure. Amid these suggestions, Tenali Rama stood quietly at the edge of the court, observing everyone with an amused smile. Finally, the king called upon Rama.
