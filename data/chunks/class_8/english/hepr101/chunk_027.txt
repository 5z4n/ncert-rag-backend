are the best because they make stories exciting. I especially like how they turn ordinary moments into something memorable. It makes me feel like intelligence and humour are just as powerful as strength. I enjoy witty characters because they always have an answer for everything! They use humour instead of fighting, and that s really wonderful. Even in folktales, they prove that smart thinking can win over force. It makes me laugh but also teaches me to stay calm in tricky situations. Witty characters add charm to a story. Their intelligence keeps the reader engaged, and their humour makes learning fun. Whether it s a folktale or a modern one, a clever character always stands out. I often feel that wit and wisdom go hand-in-hand!
