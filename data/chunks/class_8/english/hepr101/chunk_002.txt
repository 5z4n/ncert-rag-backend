with an amused smile. Finally, the king called upon Rama. The chatter in the court died down as all eyes turned to him. Rama approached the throne, carrying a plateful of paddy seeds. Bowing low, he began, Your Majesty, I bring you a revolutionary type of paddy seeds. If these are sown, the yield will be three times greater than the current results. A murmur swept through the room. One of the courtiers, known for his sarcasm, whispered just loud enough to be heard, I wonder if these are magic seeds! Next, he ll claim they grow without water. Another muttered, Perhaps he found them on the moon! Snickers rippled through the court. The king frowned, unimpressed. That sounds absurd, he muttered. Such cultivation would need special soil, manure, and pest and insect repellents. If, by chance, something were to go wrong, our farmers would suffer. Rama smiled, unfazed. That may be true, Your Majesty, but the real issue lies not with the seeds themselves but with the person who sows them. WIT AND WISDOM yield: (here) harvest sarcasm: mockery snickers: suppressed laughter absurd: illogical unfazed: not worried NUT POORVI furrowed: wrinkled sceptical: doubtful keenly: intensely gesture: a movement of a hand or the head, to express an idea or a meaning A hush fell over the court as Rama s words hung in the air.

It is as natural as breathing. The king s expression shifted as realisation dawned. His mind raced back to the quarrel with the queen. He remembered scolding her harshly for yawning while he recited his poem. He realised how unfair he had been. IfI had known that yawning was not a sign of disrespect, I wouldn t have taken her gesture so personally, he thought, regret filling his heart. That evening, the king approached the queen with a softened expression. Thirumalambal, he began, his voice gentle, I have been foolish. I see now that I overreacted. I let my pride blind me. I m so sorry. The queen, who had longed for this moment, smiled and replied, If you like, we can leave this quarrel behind us. I would very much like to listen to your poem. Rama, who had orchestrated this settlement, felt victorious. The king and the queen later presented him with valuable gifts for his service. The
