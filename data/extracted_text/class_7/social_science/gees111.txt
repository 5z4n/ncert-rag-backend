In the theme Tapestry of the Past , you read about the crops
that people grew, such as food grains or goods they made like
carnelian beads. How do you think they exchanged these
goods for things that they needed?

People exchanged goods or services for other goods and
services. This system is called the barter system. How did
this work? Suppose you need a pencil and have an extra
eraser. Meanwhile, your classmate forgot to bring their
eraser but has an extra pencil. You could exchange your
extra eraser for the extra pencil that your classmate has.
Wouldn t this satisfy your and the classmate s needs? This
is how the barter system works.

Today, we use coins and notes to buy and sell things. People
also use their mobile phones and computers for such
transactions.

The barter system was the earliest form of exchange. There
is a lot of evidence of it from around the world. People
used commodities such as cowrie shells, salt, tea, tobacco,
cloth, cattle (cows, goats, horses, sheep), seeds, etc.

for several bags of wheat. You
would then have to transport
all that wheat to several
places; first, find someone
willing to exchange a part of
the wheat for shoes, another
person for the sweater, and
yet another for the medicines.

In each of these cases, a discussion would take place to arrive
at the fair amount of wheat that you could exchange for shoes
or for the sweater.

You would have to take the
leftover bags of wheat and find
a place to store them safely.
The next time you needed
something, you would have to
carry the bags of wheat with
you again!

| What are the different types of difficulties you encountered
in the situation above?

In the farmer s story, imagine he finds someone who
is willing to trade a pair of new shoes, a sweater, and

medicines all in exchange for his ox. Do you think it
would be easy to come across such a situation?

Just like the farmer, people who depended on the barter
system would face many problems in making an exchange
in their everyday lives. They would have to find someone
who wants the exact item that they want to give, and in
return are also able to offer exactly what the other party
wants. This scenario is called double coincidence of wants.

Even if there are two people who want each other s goods
and are also willing to make an exchange, other issues
could arise in what proportion should the two goods be
exchanged? In such cases, it becomes difficult to compare
the value of one good against another. If one of the people
feels that the exchange is disadvantageous, they would not
be interested in the exchange. This is because there is no
common standard measure of value.

Similarly, you cannot exchange only a part of the ox for

ox everywhere is a problem and leads to the problem of
portability. You solved part of the problem by exchanging

The illustrations above show you some of the ways in which
people practise barter today. Have you observed similar
practices in your locality? What are the types of experiences
people have in this process?

Basic Functions of Money

It is said that necessity is the mother of invention. As the
types and numbers of things that were being exchanged
grew, and the distances across which barter was beginning
to take place became longer, it became clear that there was a
need for a different system. A common medium of exchange

Fig. 11.8

would make trade easier and so,
money came into existence. AS more
and more people began to use it for
transactions buying and selling
goods and services it became the
accepted method of payment.

As we saw in the farmer s story
above, he could not store the wheat
for long as it would rot or get eaten

08-04-2025 12:58:36

If the farmer uses money instead of wheat as a medium of
exchange, he can keep the money for a longer time and use
it for making purchases later. So, money acts as a store of
value that can be used later. Isn t it fascinating!

Money also serves aS a common denomination that
measures the value of goods and services, and enables the
comparison of goods and services in terms of their prices.

For example, your parents pay money to the shopkeepers
in exchange for various products. This money is used by the
shopkeepers to pay salaries to their workers. The workers
use the same medium to buy everyday essentials and other
goods, pay their children s school fees, etc.

Y THINK ABOUT IT

Suppose you need to buy a book. You have %50 in your
pocket. You visit the bookshop in your neighbourhood
where the shopkeeper tells you that the book is worth 100.
What options do you have to buy the book today? Will you
request the shopkeeper to allow you to make the rest of the
payment later?

The fact that money is accepted as a way of making
deferred payments makes money a standard of deferred
payment.

The Journey of Money

LET'S EXPLORE

Look at the timeline given below. What are the changes in
money that you observe?

Coinage

As you can see from the timeline, coins were among the
earliest forms of money. During those times, rulers would
issue coins that were used by the citizens of their respective
kingdoms for transactions. So different kingdoms would
have their own coinage. The minting and issue of coins was
controlled entirely by the rulers. Over time, the coins of
powerful rulers were accepted across various kingdoms and
not just their own. This facilitated trade across geographies.

The coins were made from precious metals like gold, silver,
and copper or their alloys. They were called karshdpanas
or panas. They had symbols punched on them called rupas.

Does this word sound familiar to a word we use for money

* DON'T MISS OUT

 Is it not interesting that variations of the word pana 
continue to be used in Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam as
panam and in Kannada as hana for money?

 Alloys of silver and copper were used to mint coins. The
coins we use today are also alloys consisting largely of
iron. They contain other materials like chromium, silicon,
and carbon in precise proportions. You will learn more
about alloys in your science lessons.

In ancient times, the two sides of the coins the head
(obverse) and the tail (reverse) had different kinds of
symbols and motifs engraved on them. These included
nature motifs like animals, trees and hills, and those of
kings or queens, and deities.

For example, the coins of the Chalukyas had a Varaha image
(avatar of Vishnu) on one side and decorated three-tiered
parasol on the other.

The use of coinage helped boost India s maritime trade with
the world. For example, they were found in parts of Kerala
and Tamil Nadu. This throws light on the trading activities
of southern India with the rest of the world. Based on this
finding, scholars conclude that the trade was in favour of
India.

Earlier in this chapter, we read that in ancient times coins
were issued by rulers. Today, in India, we have a central
authority called the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that
controls the issue of currency. It is not legal for anybody
other than the RBI to issue currency.

New Forms of Money

As time has progressed and technology has advanced, other
forms of money have come to be used today. Let s look at
some of them.

> The barter system existed before money came into
existence. A variety of commodities were used to facilitate
exchange.

> The limitations of the barter system led to the development
of money as a medium of exchange.

> Forms of money evolved through time, such as shells,
coins, and paper currency. This evolution continues as we
