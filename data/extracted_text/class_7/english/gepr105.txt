Dear Ananda,

Hope you are all doing well!

Do you remember our last conversation about war and the
importance of peace? We talked about how India had to
struggle for its Independence from the British for many
centuries. Post-independence our country has had to fight

territorial several wars to protect its borders, territorial integrity, and its
integrity: people. This made me wonder, who were these brave Indian
safeguarding people? They fought to protect our country and sacrificed their

nation s borders tives so that we could lead our lives in peace. What were their

names? Where did they come from? Does anyone remember
anything about them?

Last week I got the answers to some of my questions during
an educational trip to New Delhi organised by our school. You
may recall, I was looking forward to this trip and our visit
to many places of historical and educational significance.
I learnt several new and interesting things, and I am excited
to share them with you.

Let me begin by asking you to guess the name of the monument
that I found most inspiring. Let s see if you can guess. The
construction of this monument started in April 2018 and
was completed in February 2019. It was envisioned and then
inaugurated by India s Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi

in February 2019. In terms of location and size, it is spread
over 40 acres of land near the iconic India Gate. But more
importantly, it is a tribute to some of the bravest Indians. I m
sure you ve guessed! It s the National War Memorial . Won t
you Say, a long-desired aspiration was fulfilled?

Our visit to the National War Memorial began with our teacher
explaining that even after Independence, India has had to fight
many wars to protect herself, and the freedom and security
we enjoy today is because of the many brave men and women
who have served in the Indian Armed Forces over decades.
Sadly, she said, war always takes its toll, and therefore, many
brave soldiers have had to sacrifice their lives for the country
even after our Independence in 1947.

This is what makes monuments like the National War Memorial
extremely important, so that we should never forget the cost
of freedom. We are aware, always, of the pain and horrors
of war. We learnt that each brick of the memorial is called a
tablet, and it bears the names of soldiers who fought for India
and made the supreme sacrifice in different wars from 1947
till date, including the Indo-China conflict of 1962, the IndoPak Wars in 1965 & 1971 and the Kargil War in 1999. There
are 29,000 tablets on which more than 26,000 names of fallen
soldiers have been etched.

It was heartening to know that our government has recognised
the sacrifice of brave soldiers. Our teacher told us about the 21
bravehearts who were awarded the Param Vir Chakra (PVC),
India s highest wartime gallantry medal, for their service to
the nation. She also told us about Maha Vir Chakra (MVC),
Kirti Chakra (KC), Vir Chakra (VrC), and Shaurya Chakra (SC).

Major Somnath Sharma was posthumously awarded India s
first PVC in the Battle of Badgam in 1947. Later some more
PVCs were awarded for exceptional gallantry during the IndiaChina Conflict of 1962, and the India-Pakistan War of 1965.
Besides, a PVC was also awarded for service during the UN
Peace Keeping Operations in Congo.

In the 1971 war, some of the heroes who were awarded the
PVC (posthumously) include Lance Naik Albert Ekka, Flying
Officer Nirmal Jit Singh Sekhon, Second Lieutenant Arun
Khetarpal, and Major Hoshiar Singh. Some Navy personnel

including Captain Mahendra Nath Mulla were also awarded

Then the teacher shared with us the citation of Param Vir Chakra
awardee Lance Naik Albert Ekka. It touched my heart and also
motivated me. We were awestruck and humbled by his bravery.
I aspire to be courageous like him when I join the army!

Lance Naik Albert Ekka (PVC)

Lance Naik Albert Ekka, (No. 4239746), 14 Guards

Lance Naik Albert Ekka was in the left forward company of a
Battalion of the Brigade of Guards during their attack on the enemy
defence at Gangasagar on the eastern front. This was a well-fortified
position held in strength by the enemy. The assaulting troops were
subjected to intense shelling and heavy small arms fire, but they
charged on to the objective and were locked in bitter hand-to-hand
combat. Lance Naik Albert Ekka noticed an enemy Light Machine
Gun inflicting heavy casualties on his company. With complete
disregard to his personal safety, he charged the enemy bunker,
bayoneted two enemy soldiers and silenced the Light Machine Gun.
Though seriously wounded in this encounter, he continued to fight
alongside his comrades through the mile deep objective, clearing
bunker after bunker with undaunted courage. Towards the northern
end of the objective, one enemy Medium Machine Gun opened up
from the second storey of a well-fortified building inflicting heavy
casualties and holding up the attack. Once again, this gallant soldier
without worrying about his personal safety, despite his serious
injury and the heavy volume of enemy fire, crawled forward till he
reached the building and lobbed a grenade through the loophole of

the bunker, killing one enemy and injuring the other.

The Medium Machine Gun, however, continued to fire. With
outstanding courage and grim determination, Lance Naik Albert
Ekka scaled a side wall and entering the bunker, bayoneted the
enemy who was still firing and thus silenced the Machine Gun,
saving further casualties to his company and ensured the success
of the attack.

Inthis process, however, he received serious injuries and succumbed
to them after the capture of the objective. In this action, Lance Naik
Albert Ekka displayed the most conspicuous valour, determination
and made the supreme sacrifice in the best traditions of the Army.
(Gazette of India Notification No. 7- Pres./72)

As we continued our visit around the National War Memorial,
we came across another important installation called Amar
Jawan Jyoti that commemorates our soldiers. The name, as
you may have guessed, represents an immortal flame that
is kept ablaze all through the day and night to revere the
sacrifices of our soldiers. Earlier the Amar Jawan Jyoti, which
also displayed a rifle and a helmet, was alighted under the
of India Gate in January 1972 to commemorate India s
he India-Pakistan War of 1971.

he National War Memorial now includes Amar
wan Jyoti in the obelisk, which is surrounded by
r Chakras. During the inauguration, the Prime
nister lit a new flame to commemorate the fallen
eroes. Later, the old flame at India Gate was also
merged with the new flame at the National War
_ Memorial. Here is a picture of the new Amar Jawan

Our teacher also explained the significance of the Chakras to
us. I found it interesting and hence I am sharing with you.

The National War Memorial consists of four concentric circles,
which are known as Amar Chakra, Veerta Chakra, Tyag Chakra,
and Raksha Chakra around a 15-metre-tall central obelisk
with the eternal flame the Amar Jawan Jyoti. It also houses

murals: large bronze and stone murals and graphic panels. Isn t it amazing!
1. The innermost circle represents the Amar Chakra, also

known as the Circle of Immortality . This has the Obelisk with
Eternal Flame. The Amar Jawan Jyoti flame symbolises the
immortality of the spirit of fallen soldiers with the assurance
that the nation will never forget their sacrifice.

The second circle is called the Veerta Chakra, which is also
known as the Circle of Bravery . There is a covered gallery
that exhibits six murals crafted in bronze, depicting valiant
battle actions of our Armed Forces.

The third circle represents the Tyag Chakra, also known
as the Circle of Sacrifice . The circular concentric walls of
honour symbolise the ancient war formation, which is called
Chakravyuh. The walls are covered with granite tablets and

The outermost circle represents the Raksha Chakra, which
is also known as the Circle of Protection . In this chakra the
row of trees is a reassurance to the citizens of the country
about their safety against any threat. Each tree represents the
soldiers who ensure the territorial integrity of the nation.

We spent the whole day, from morning to evening, at the
National War Memorial and the surrounding areas, marked by
majestic lawns and grand buildings of Kartavyapath. We were
immersed in the ambience that was solemn and a reminder
of what a free nation could achieve. The overall environment
created an emotive experience that was visually inspiring. I
felt as if I had developed a bond with the place.

Ilearnt a lot, but I also have to admit that the various discourses
during the day brought tears to my eyes. It was sad to think
about the massive devastation and loss of life caused by wars.
It motivated me to live a life worthy of the sacrifices of our
heroes.

After our visit, the class decided to make presentations on
stories of valour of the bravehearts we came across at the
National War Memorial. We divided ourselves into five
groups. We decided to make
presentations depicting the
courageous. stories of the
soldiers. Our teacher has
also advised us to share our

CITATION

Major Papmapani Acuarya (IC-55072) 2 RajpuTANA RIFLES
(PosTHUMoUS)

On 28 June 1999, Major Padmapani Acharya as a Company Commander,
was assigned the formidable task of capturing an enemy position
which was heavily fortified, strongly held and covered with mines and
sweeping machine gun and artillery fire.

Success of the battalion and brigade operation hinged on the early
capture of this position. However, the company attack almost faltered at
the very beginning when the enemy s artillery fire came down squarely
on the leading platoon, inflicting large number of casualties.

With utter disregard to his personal safety, Major Padmapani Acharya
took the reserve platoon of his company and led it through raining
artillery shells. Even as his men were falling to the murderous enemy
fire, he continued to encourage his men and charged at the enemy up
the steep rock face with his reserve platoon.

Unmindful of the hail of bullets from the enemy s position, Major
Padmapani Acharya crawled up to the enemy position and lobbed
grenades. In this daring assault, Major Acharya was severely injured.
Despite being seriously injured and unable to move, he ordered his men
to leave him and charge at the enemy while he continued to fire at the
enemy. The enemy position was finally over-run and the objective was
captured.

After completion of the mission, the officer however, succumbed to his
injuries.

Major Padmapani Acharya displayed exceptional courage, leadership
and spirit of self-sacrifice in the face of the enemy.

https://www.gallantryawards.gov.in/awards

Before he went into battle, he wrote a letter to his father that
he wasn t afraid or scared about losing his life while trying to
protect the motherland. Quoting Shrimad Bhagavad Gita he went
on to say:

Dear Soumya,

It was such a pleasure to receive your letter. I enjoyed reading
your experience of the visit to the National War Memorial in
Delhi, as well as your observations and feelings during the
visit. You really have an eye for detail, and being the sensitive
person that you are, you have been able to capture the essence
of the emotions associated with this memorial.

I was happy to hear that you got an opportunity to visit the
National War Memorial. I have heard a lot about it. Some
people might see a war memorial as just a monument,
statue, an edifice to celebrate our war heroes or victory and
commemorate those who lost their lives or got injured in the
war. In my view, it is also an expression of deep gratitude for
the supreme sacrifice made by our brave soldiers defending
the sovereignty and integrity of the country. I feel motivated
and I am seriously thinking of joining the Armed Forces to
serve my motherland.

I also feel it is our duty to periodically visit such places to
honour our valiant soldiers, who have made great sacrifices
for us. Their sacrifices enable us to walk freely in our country
without fear of enemy threats. It is nice of your teacher and
school to arrange this visit to give you all a chance to learn
about India s heroes and also pay your respect to them. The
idea of your class to make a presentation at the school and
make everyone a part of your experience is wonderful! Best of

luck for your presentation, I hope it goes well and motivates the
school students to join the Indian Armed Forces.

Your letter has reminded me of a time when we visited the war
memorial in our city. While visiting one of Chandigarh s gardens,
we saw a lot of activity around the Bougainvillea Garden in Sector 3.
As we approached the garden, we saw people offering flowers and
prayers. We joined the group out of curiosity and quickly realised
that they were all there to pay respect to the soldiers at the War
Memorial located in the heart of the garden.

When I think back about my visit where everyone was dedicating
flowers as a mark of respect to our soldiers, I was reminded of
the following poem:

Pusup KI ABHILASHA

Chaah Nahi, Main Sur Bala Ke Gehanon

Chaah Nahi, Premi-Mala Mein Bandh

I hope you like the poem. I must say, I was inspired by your
idea of presenting the valourous stories of India s soldiers.
There are so many stories of courage, bravery and sacrifice
which remind us that many of the challenges we face in our
lives are inconsequential. We can enjoy peace in our country
and the luxury of exchanging ideas with our friends because
our Armed Forces are alert and work hard to create that
environment for us.

Very recently, I read in the

You will listen to a girl speak about why she wishes to join the Armed
Forces when she grows up. As you listen, answer the questions given
below in two-three exact words you hear.

Good morning, respected teachers and my dear friends.

Today, I, Gunjan, of Grade 7-C, stand before you to share why I
dream of joining the Indian Armed Forces when I grow up.

Serving our country is the most honourable job one can have.
It means protecting and securing our nation, even if it means
risking one s life. The thought of wearing the uniform, which
can only be earned through hard work, fills me with pride and a
strong desire to serve India.

The Armed Forces teach you to live a disciplined and organised
life. This keeps both the mind and body active. Soldiers are always
ready to face challenges because of this discipline. Additionally,
regular exercise and training keep soldiers physically fit and
ready for any situation. This preparation is something I greatly
admire and wish to achieve.

Lastly, being a soldier means having new experiences and
adventures everyday. Each day brings new challenges, teaching
important lessons, and helping one grow. The Armed Forces
offer a life filled with honour, self-respect, safety, and security
for both the soldier and their families. It is a life that teaches
loyalty, duty, service, and honesty.

This is why I want to join the Indian Armed Forces.
Thank you.

I Think and complete the poem titled A Soldier s Pride .

II Now, listen to the poem and correct your answers wherever required.

In fields so vast, our soldiers stand,

With hearts so brave, and firm command,
They guard our land both night and day,
To keep our fears and foes at bay.

With every dawn and setting sun,
Their duty calls, it must be done,
Through stormy skies and blazing heat,
They march along with steady feet.

For love of land, they fight and strive,
To keep our hopes and dreams alive,
With pride and honour, they defend,
Our India, till the very end.

You will listen to the teacher speak about a braveheart. As you listen,
complete the bio-table given below.

Hello children, you all have read about Rani Abbakka. Let me
share with you some details about one more braveheart. Her
name is Rani Gaidinliu.

Gaidinliu was born on 26 January 1915, in the present-day
Tamenglong district of Manipur. She was a Naga leader who led
an armed uprising against the British in Manipur, Nagaland, and
Assam. Gaidinliu belonged to the Rongmei tribe, also known as
the Kabui tribe.

In 1927, at the age of 13, Gaidinliu joined the Heraka movement.
This movement aimed at the revival of the Naga tribal religion
and the establishment of self-rule for the Nagas, ending
British rule.

Gaidinliu was arrested in 1932 when she was just 16 and was
sentenced to life imprisonment by the British rulers. Between
1932 and 1947, she was kept in several prisons across the
Northeast.

After being released in 1947, she continued to work for the
betterment of her community. The then Prime Minister described
Gaidinliu as the Daughter of the Hills and gave her the title Rani 
for her courage. She was also awarded the Padma Bhushan in
1982.

In 1991, Rani Gaidinliu returned to her birthplace, where she
died on 17 February 1993 at the age of 78. Rani Gaidinliu was
conferred the Birsa Munda Award posthumously.

The State Government has developed a park along with a statue
to honour Rani Gaidinliu in Silchar, Assam. Not only that, the
Government of India issued a postal stamp in her honour in 1996
and a commemorative coin in 2015.

What a braveheart indeed!
