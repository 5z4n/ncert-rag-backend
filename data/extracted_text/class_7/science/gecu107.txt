Heat Transfer
in Nature

Pema and her brother Palden reside in Gangtok. On a cold winter
evening, they are sitting around a fireplace. Palden shares his
experiences of visiting Kerala during the winter vacation. He
says that compared to Gangtok, winter in Kerala is comparatively
warm and humid. Both Pema and Palden are curious about why
some places are so cold and others quite hot.

Hearing them express their curiosity, their grandfather, a
retired science teacher, says, Kerala is closer to the equator than
Sikkim and it also has a long coastline, which results in warmer
and more humid weather conditions . Palden replies, Yes, we
learnt in Grade 6 Science and Social Science that for us on the
Earth, the Sun is the main source of heat and light, and around
the equator, the climate is generally hot .

As they are talking, Pema is keenly observing her grandmother
cooking thukpa (a traditional Sikkimese dish) in a large metal
pan. Pema asks, Why are cooking utensils generally made of
metals? Palden immediately responds that they had studied
in the chapter The World of Metals and Non-metals that such
materials are good conductors of heat.

How does heat get ~
transferred in these
materials?

Let us perform an activity to learn why certain materials are
good conductors of heat.

You observed that the pin closest to the candle flame (pin I)
falls first, followed by pins IJ, III, and IV. Why does pin I fall before
pin II? Why did all the pins not fall together?

From your observations, what can you infer? Do you think
that heat is being transferred along the metal strip from the
end that is being heated? As the heat travels along the strip and
approaches a pin, the wax holding it melts and the pin falls. Here,
the transfer of heat takes place from the hot end of the strip to the
colder end. The process of heat transfer from the hotter part of
an object to the colder part is called conduction. In this process,
the particle that gets heated, passes the heat on to its neighbour,
and so on. However, the particles themselves do not move from
their positions.

Materials like metals that allow heat to pass through them
easily are called good conductors of heat. Because metals are
good conductors of heat, we use utensils made of metals for
cooking. In solids, heat transfer takes place mainly through the
process of conduction.

If we use a strip made of a material like wood or glass in place
of a metal strip to perform Activity 7.1, the pins will not fall. Can
you think of the reason for this based on our learning from the
chapter The World of Metals and Non-Metals ?

Materials such as glass and wood do not
allow heat to pass through them easily and
are poor conductors (insulators) of heat.
Clay and porcelain are also poor conductors
of heat that is why tea or coffee kept in
such cups stays hot longer.

List some materials around you and
classify them as good or poor conductors
of heat in Table 7.2.

generally use metal
utensils for cooking,

and porcelain cups for
drinking tea or coffee.

Does your list include air? If it is there on the list, where have
you placed it?

You must have experienced that during winters, we prefer
wearing woollen clothes to keep ourselves warm.

Chapter 7.indd 91 4/3/2025 4:53:57 PM

Woollen fabric traps air in its pores
and as air is a poor conductor of heat,
it reduces heat flow from our bodies to
our surroundings. As a result, we feel
warm. Similarly, air trapped between
the layers of clothing acts as a poor
conductor of heat and keeps us warm.
The presence of air between two thin
blankets is the reason why we prefer
Fig. 7.2: Air trapped between two thin blankets them over one thick blanket to keep

acts as an insulator us warm (Fig. 7.2).
Is it possible to construct houses that are not affected much
by the outside heat and cold? Houses constructed in places with
a very hot or cold climate often use the concept of heat transfer
to keep them cool or warm.

FASCINATING FACTS

The upper regions ofthe Himalayas, such as the Mori block of Uttarkashi
in Uttarakhand, experience an extremely cold climate and heavy
snowfall during winters. Houses here are often built to stay warm
during winters, with walls made of two wooden layers filled with cow
dung and mud between them. As wood and mud are poor conductors
of heat, they prevent heat loss and help in keeping the houses warm.

There are houses with outer walls that are constructed using
hollow bricks that keep them warm in winters and cool in
summers. This happens because the air that gets trapped in the
hollow bricks is a poor conductor of heat.

Observation about the cups Probable reasons for the observation

Heat Transfer in Nature

You observed that the cup under which thecandle #rr
was placed, rises up (Fig. 7.3b). Why is it so? The air
around the candle flame heats up. As the air in the
cup warms up, it expands and occupies more space.
As a result, it becomes lighter and rises up.

You can experience the expansion of air on
heating it by placing a partially inflated balloon in
the Sun (Fig. 7.4). After the air in the balloon gets
heated, it expands and the balloon becomes larger.

You must have observed that when an incense
stick (agarbatti) is burnt, smoke rises up. Smoke is a
mixture of hot gases and tiny solid particles that are released
when something burns. As itis warmer than the surrounding air,
it rises up.

Let us find out how heat transfer
takes place in liquids by performing
the following activity.

Fig. 7.6: Measurement of the
temperature of soil and water

 * Observe the movement of the coloured streak in the
water.

 + As you supply heat, a streak of colour starts moving
up and then coming down from the sides (Fig. 7.5b).

Why does the streak of coloured water go up in the
middle and come down from the sides? The water at the
bottom of the beaker gets heated up and becomes hot.
It expands, becomes lighter, and rises. The water on the
sides of the beaker is comparatively cooler and heavier,
and comes down to take the place of the rising water.
Then, this water gets heated and in turn also rises.

This cycle continues until the entire volume of water
gets heated. In this case, the entire volume of water gets
heated through the actual movement of water particles.
This process of heat transfer is known as convection. It
is because of convection that we see the movement of the
coloured streak inside the beaker.

Thus, we can conclude that water, like air, gets heated
up by the process of convection. Here, heat transfer takes
place by the actual movement of particles of liquids and
gases from one place to another.

7.2.1 Land and Sea Breeze

Palden shares his experience of visiting a beach in Kerala during
winter vacation and says, During the day, the sand or soil near
the beach is hotter than the water in the sea. However, at night,
the sand or soil is cooler than the water. Pema replies, Yes,
different objects get heated and cooled differently. 

Let us check how land and water get heated and cooled by
performing an activity.

Did the temperature rise by the same amount for both the
soil and the water at the same time?

* If not, which one got heated faster?

* How much was the rise in temperature of the soil and the
water in 20 minutes?

After 20 minutes, you will find that the temperature of the
soil rises more than that of the water. This indicates that the soil
heats up faster than water.

Does the soil also cool faster than water? After letting the soil
and water get heated, bring the set-up indoors and let it cool for
20 minutes. You will observe that
the soil cools faster than water,
just as it gets heated faster.

People living in _ coastal
areas experience an interesting
phenomenon caused by _ the
heating and cooling of land and
water at different rates. As the
land gets heated faster than water
during the day, it causes warm
air above the land to rise. This
causes cooler air to move from 7
the sea towards the land. This SS
movement of cooler air from the Fig. 7.7(a): Sea breeze
sea to the land is called sea breeze
(Fig. 7.7a). Hence, in hot places, sea breeze relieves people from
the heat. That is why, windows of the houses in coastal areas are
placed facing the sea.

7.3 Radiation
[eet esse see a nee }

Do you remember when Pema and Palden were sitting around
the fireplace? They felt warm.

Their grandfather tells them that the
heat transfer, in this case, takes place
directly from the fire (hot object) to us by a
process known as radiation. The heat of the
Sun reaches us through this process. Heat
transfer by radiation does not require any medium.

All objects radiate heat. You must have observed that a hot
utensil kept away from the flame cools down after some time.
What is the reason for it? The hot utensil cools down by radiating
heat to its surroundings.

IVE \ Why is it more comfortable to wear white or light-coloured
EEPER 4 ) clothes during summers and dark-coloured clothes during
- winters?

Light-coloured clothes reflect most of the heat that falls on
them, and therefore, we feel more comfortable wearing
them during summers. Dark surfaces, on the other hand,
absorb more heat, and therefore, we feel more comfortable
with dark-coloured clothes during winters.

| Chapter 7.indd 96

4/3/2025 4:54:03 PM

There are many examples in our daily life, where we can
observe conduction, convection, and radiation happening
together.

Consider the case of water being heated up, as
shown in Fig. 7.8. Let us identify the various ways in
which the pan and the water get heated up, as well
as the warmth we feel around the flame and the hot
pan. Heat is transferred from the flame to the utensil
by conduction. Subsequently, water in the utensil
gets heated up by convection. The warmth that we
feel around the flame and the hot utensil is due to
radiation.

Let us wrap up!

From the activities, examples, and discussions so far, we find that
there are three processes by which heat gets transferred. These
are conduction, convection, and radiation.

 + In conduction, heating takes place when one particle receives
heat, transfers heat to the next particle in contact, and so
on. The particles themselves do not move away from their
positions.

In convection, heat transfer takes place by the actual
movement of particles.

Note that in conduction and convection, a medium must be
present whose particles help in the transfer of heat.

In the case of radiation, heat travels from one place to
another and no material medium is required for its transfer.

FASCINATING FACTS

In the upper reaches of the Himalayan
region, a traditional room heater locally
known as bukhari is used to keep rooms
warm during winters. It consists of an iron
stove in which wood or charcoal is burnt.
A long pipe attached to the upper part of
the heater serves as a chimney, venting
out the smoke. Additionally, the bukhari
can be used for cooking, as its flat top
provides a platform for placing utensils.
All the three processes of heat transfer
are involved when this device is used for
cooking and warming up the room.

You have learnt in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity, that
the Sun is the main source of heat for the Earth. You have seen
your parents drying wet clothes on the clothesline at home. Wet
clothes dry faster on a sunny day since the heat from the Sun
makes the evaporation of water faster.

Thus, heat from the Sun plays an important role in the
evaporation of water, be it from clothes drying on a line or from
water bodies like oceans and lakes. Let us look at the phenomenon
of water cycle to understand this in more detail.

7.4 Water Cycle
Op

You have also learnt in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity,
that water exists in three states in nature. As a liquid, it fills
the oceans, rivers, and lakes on the Earth. As a solid, it forms
snow, ice sheets, and glaciers in the mountains and the polar
regions. As a gas, it exists in the form of water vapour in the
Earth s atmosphere. During summers, some of the snow and
ice gets converted to water due to the Sun s radiation and flows
down as rivers, and ultimately into the oceans. The melted ice is
replenished by fresh snow during winters.

Water in the oceans,
rivers, and lakes gets
ul heated due to the Sun, and
&h\ \ ; as a result, it evaporates

as water vapour. Water
al f UAV 8 y= also evaporates from
a Show. trees and plants through

transpiration.

When water vapour
rises up, it cools down
and condenses to form
clouds. Clouds bring
rain, snow, and _ hail.
This process is called

Fig. 7.9: Water cycle precipitation.

The continuous movement of water upward as water vapour
and downward through precipitation, passing through soil, rocks,
and plants, and finally returning to water bodies, is called water
cycle (Fig. 7.9). Thus, the water cycle helps in redistributing and
replenishing water in rivers, lakes, and oceans. It also serves to
conserve the total amount of water on the Earth. Rainwater that
falls on the surface of the Earth, flows into ponds, lakes, rivers,
and oceans or seeps into the ground.

Do your findings match with your predictions?

You may have observed that water seeps fastest through
gravel, slower through sand, and slowest through clay. Why
is it so? The spaces between gravel particles are wider when
compared to those in sand and clay. Hence, water can seep
through the gravel more easily. In this way, water seeps
beneath the surface of the Earth. This process of surface water
seeping through soil and rocks is called infiltration. Water
can infiltrate more readily if the spaces between soil and
rock particles are wider, open, and interconnected (Fig. 7.11).

The water that seeps through gets stored in the pore spaces
of sediments and the openings in rocks beneath the surface
as groundwater. The underground layers of sediments and
rocks that store water in pore spaces are called aquifers
(Fig. 7.12). This is the water we extract by digging wells or
drilling bore wells into aquifers. This water may be a few
metres to hundreds of metres below the ground, depending

However, groundwater is not unlimited. The growing water
requirements of an increasing population have led to excessive
groundwater extraction. Additionally, decreased vegetation cover
and increased concrete surfaces in urban areas have limited
water infiltration. As a result, groundwater is getting depleted.
To address this, rainwater harvesting and recharge pits are used
to replenish groundwater. Hence, the water cycle ensures that
groundwater sources are recharged, thereby helping to ensure a
sustainable groundwater supply.

Since water scarcity makes life difficult, people have
developed different ways to conserve water. For example, in
Ladakh, people have developed innovative ways to conserve
water by making ice stupas (Fig. 7.13) during the winters.

SCIENCE AND SOCIETY

Ice Stupa

During the spring season in
Ladakh, streams often dry
up, leading to scarcity of
water as the heat from the
Sun s radiation is not enough
to melt the snow on the
mountains. During winters,
water from mountain
streams is channeled down
through underground pipes.
This water is then sprayed
into the cold air. As it falls, it Fig. 7.13: Ice stupa

freezes due to extremely low

temperatures.

The ice builds up layer by layer, creating a tall, cone-shaped
structure called an ice stupa as shown in Fig. 7.13. The ice stupa
melts slowly during spring, providing water for farming and other
needs throughout the summer.

In convection, heat transfer takes place by the actual
movement of particles. Land and sea breezes are examples
of the process of convection.

Heat from the Sun reaches the Earth through radiation.

All objects exchange heat with their surroundings through
the process of radiation.

Processes of conduction and convection require a medium
for heat transfer but no medium is required for the radiation
process.

The principles of heat transfer are utilised in designing
houses and clothing.

The continuous movement of water upward as water
vapour and downward through precipitation, passing
through soil, rocks and plants, and finally returning to water
bodies, is called water cycle.

The process of surface water seeping through soil and rocks
is called infiltration.

Groundwater is the water that seeps through and gets stored
in the pore spaces of sediments and the openings in rocks
beneath the surface.

The underground layers of sediments and rocks that store
water in pore spaces are called aquifers.
