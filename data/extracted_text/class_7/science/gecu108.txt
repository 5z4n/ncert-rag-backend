Measurement of
Time and Motion

Prerna and her younger sister are watching a sports channel
on television. Prerna enjoys running and she has been declared
the fastest runner among the girls in her district for winning
the 100 metre sprint at an interschool competition held at the
district level. She is now training to compete at the state level.
She dreams of representing India at the international level in 100
metre sprint contests in future.

While watching the rerun of sprints at the Olympic games held
in the past, Prerna is always amazed that the measurement of
the time taken for the race is so advanced that they could identify
the winner even when two sprinters seemed to cross the finish
line almost together. However, in her school, the sports teacher
only used a special kind of watch called a stopwatch for timing
the school races. She had noticed her mother wearing a watch on
her wrist and her sister looking at her mobile phone when she
needed to check the time. Her uncle used a Braille watch and had
recently acquired a talking watch that announced the time at the
touch of a button. There was also a large clock on the wall near
the school entrance. Her thoughts turned to people in the ancient
past, who did not have the modern gadgets we have today and
she wondered...

8.1 Measurement of Time

Humans got interested in keeping track of time long ago. They
started noticing that many events in nature repeat themselves
after definite intervals of time. For example, the rising and setting
of the Sun, the phases of the Moon and the changing seasons.
They started using the cycles of these events for timekeeping.
First, they devised calendars. A day was defined by the cycle of
rising and setting of the Sun. Then began the quest to find ways
of knowing the time of day.

So, they made many devices which
helped them to measure smaller intervals
of time within a day. Some of these were
sundials, water clocks, hourglasses, and
candle clocks.

In a sundial, time is determined with
the changing position of the shadow of an
object cast by the light of the Sun during
the day (Fig. 8.1).

The water clocks used the flow of water
out or into a vessel to measure time. In
one type, water flowed out from a vessel
which had markings for time (Fig. 8.2a). In
the other type, there would be a bowl, with
a fine hole at the bottom, which was
floated on the surface of water (Fig. 8.2b).

; ; It gradually filled up in a fixed time and

floated again.

In an hourglass (Fig. 8.3), time was
measured on the basis of the flow of sand
from one bulb to another.

Candle clocks (Fig. 8.4) were candles
with markings that indicated the passage
of time when burned.

FASCINATING FACTS

The world s largest stone sundial,
the Samrat Yantra, was built
around 300 years ago at the Jantar
Mantar, in Jaipur, Rajasthan,
a UNESCO World Heritage site
that houses several astronomical
instruments. With its imposing
height of 27 metres, its shadow
moves at about 1 millimetre per
second and falls on a scale finely marked to measure time intervals as
short as 2 seconds. Like any sundial, it measures local or solar time ,
requiring a correction to determine Indian Standard Time.

Should we make a simple water clock?

FASCINATING FACTS

In ancient India, time was measured using both shadows and water
clocks. The earliest reference to shadow-based time measurement
appears in the Arthasastra by Kautilya (was composed and revised
between the second century BCE-third century CE). An accurate
expression for time in terms of the shadow of a vertical stick was
given by Varahamihira around 530 CE. The water clock with water
flowing out was described in the Arthasastra, Sardulakarnavadana,
and some other texts (early CE centuries). These clocks were not very
accurate because as water levels dropped, the flow rate decreased.
This led to the development of the sinking bowl water clock
(Fig. 8.2b), or Ghatika-yantra, first mentioned by Aryabhata, and then
in several astronomical texts later. Time was measured constantly
with Ghatika-yantra at Buddhist monasteries, royal palaces, town
squares, and each time the bowl sank, it was announced by drums,
conch shells, or striking a gong. Though the Ghatika-yantra was
progressively replaced by pendulum clocks in the late nineteenth
century, it continued to be used at the religious places for rituals.

As human civilisation advanced, and
as people began to travel long distances,
the measurement of time became very
critical. This led to the development of
increasingly better mechanical devices
for the measurement of time, driven
by weights, gears, and springs from the
fourteenth century onwards. However,
the invention of the pendulum clock
in the seventeenth century marked
a major breakthrough in mechanical
timekeeping.

KNOW A SCIENTIST

The pendulum clock was invented in 1656 and patented in 1657 by
Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695). He was inspired by the investigations
of pendulums by Galileo Galilei (1564-1642). It is said that once while
_ sitting in a church, Galileo s attention was drawn to a lamp suspended
 / from the ceiling, which was swinging back and forth. Using his pulse
_*. to measure time, Galileo found that the lamp took the same time for
each swing. After experimenting with different pendulums, Galileo
concluded that the time taken to complete one oscillation was always
the same for a pendulum of a given length.

8.1.1 A simple pendulum

A simple pendulum
consists of a _ small
metallic ball (called the
bob of the pendulum)
suspended from a rigid
support by a long thread
as shown in Fig. 8.7a.

We did an activity in the chapter
 Measurement of Length and Motion 
in the Grade 6 Science textbook
Curiosity, where we observed the
oscillatory motion of an eraser hung
with a thread. Is the pendulum
similar to that?

The pendulum at rest is in its mean position. When the bob of
the pendulum is moved slightly to one side and released, it starts
oscillatory motion. Its motion is periodic in nature because it
repeats its path after a fixed interval of time.

The pendulum is said to have completed one oscillation when
its bob, starting from its mean position O, moves to extreme
position A, changes direction and moves to another extreme
position B, changes direction and comes back to O (Fig. 8.7b). The
pendulum also completes one oscillation when its bob moves
from one extreme position A to another extreme position B and
comes back to A. The time taken by the pendulum to complete
one oscillation is called its time period. Let us now set up a
pendulum and measure its time period.

[Activity 8.2: Let us experiment e|

ball with hook/ a stone (bob), a stopwatch/ watch, and aruler.

Tie the bob at one end of the string.

Fix the other end of the string to a rigid support such that the
length of the string in between support and bob is around
100 cm.

Wait for the bob to come to rest. Your pendulum is now
ready.

Gently hold the bob, move it slightly to one side and release
it. Take care not to push the bob while releasing it and that
the string is taut. Is your pendulum now oscillating?

>,
~

Using a watch, measure the time it takes for the pendulum
to complete 10 oscillations. Record the time in Table 8.1.

>,
~

Repeat this activity 3-4 times.

Divide the time taken for 10 oscillations by 10 to calculate
the time period of your pendulum. Note it down in Table 8.1.

Is the time period of your pendulum almost the same every
time? What do you conclude from this observation? The time
period of the pendulum is almost the same every time.

THINK LIKE A SCIENTIST!

You just did an important historical experiment which was first done
by Galileo, except you used a watch to measure time in place of your
pulse beat. Suppose you were Galileo experimenting with pendulums,
what all would you investigate? What questions could you ask? Would
all pendulums have the same time period? How would you test this?

Repeat Activity 8.2 using the same bob but with pendulums of two
or three different lengths. Does the time period change? If so, how does
the length affect it? If changing the length influences the time period,
does the bob s mass also matter? Test this by repeating Activity 8.2
. with a fixed pendulum length but with bobs of different mass. Do you
observe any change?

The time period of a simple pendulum depends on its length but
not on the bob s mass. All pendulums of the same length have the same
time period at a given location.

The time period of a simple pendulum of a given length is
constant at a place. This property is used in the measurement of
time.

All clocks, old or modern, are based on some process repeating
continuously, which can be used to mark equal intervals of time.

Modern clocks measure time using the same basic principle 
periodically repeating processes but use tiny and very rapid IVE
vibrations either from a quartz crystal (quartz clocks) or from some \ EEPER
specific atoms (atomic clocks). While Huygens early pendulum 
clocks could gain or lose 10 seconds each day, today s atomic clocks &

are so precise that they lose only one second in millions of years!
Scientists are constantly searching for even better ways to measure
time with greater accuracy.

Measurement of Time and Motion

8.1.2 SI unit of time

The SI unit of time is the second. Its symbol is s. The larger units
of time are minute (min) and hour (h).

60s=1min 60 min=1h

IV Units of time, such as second, minute, and hour begin with a
EEPER _ )!owercase letter, except at the beginning of a sentence. Their
~ symbols s , min , and h are also written in lowercase letters

G) and in singular. Note that a full stop is not written after the
symbol, except at the end of a sentence. While writing the time,

always leave a space between the number and the unit. Also,
note that writing sec for second and hrs for hour is incorrect.

FASCINATING FACTS

The hole in the bowl of Ghatika-yantra was made in such a manner
that it took 24 minutes to fill and sink. The time unit measured by this
clock was called ghatika or ghati. It became the standard unit of time
measurement and continued until the end of the nineteenth century.
A 24-hour-long day was, thus, divided into 60 equal ghatis.

SCIENCE AND SOCIETY

In today s world, measuring tiny fractions of a second is very
important! For example, in sports, timekeeping devices can
record events down to one-hundredth or even one-thousandth of
a second (a millisecond) to determine the winners in a race. In
medicine, heart monitors like Electrocardiogram (ECG) machines
measure the millisecond variations in heartbeats to detect health
issues. In music, digital recordings capture sound thousands of
times per second for smooth playback. Many devices use even
shorter intervals, smartphones, and computers process signals
in microseconds (one-millionth of a second), allowing them
to operate very fast. Scientists continue to develop even more
precise time-measuring tools for space exploration, medicine, and
advanced science experiments. The faster and more accurate our
clocks become, the more they help society in ways we may not
even notice!

For races covering the same
distance, we can tell who was
faster by measuring time. But how
can we tell that when comparing
races for different distances?

8.2 Slow or Fast

What do we mean when we say something is moving fast or
slow? Suppose you are watching a 100 metre race on a straight
track. All the players begin from the starting line together but
after sometime they are not running together (Fig. 8.10). How do
you decide who is running faster amongst them?

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7

Chapter 8.indd 112 4/3/2025 4:54:39 PM

Chapter 8.indd 113

Fig. 8.10: Boys running a race ona straight track

Someone who is ahead of others at some instant of time, is
running faster than them. Hence, someone who has covered
more distance within the same time is running faster.

The distances moved by objects in a given interval of time
decide which one is faster or slower. We often say that the faster
runner has a higher speed. You are probably familiar with the
word speed .

8.3 Speed
[SS Sennnnsso>> ene |

By comparing the distances moved by two or more objects in a
unit time, it can be found out which of them is moving faster. The
unit time may be one second or one minute or one hour. We call
the distance covered by an object in a unit time as the speed of
the object.

How can we determine the speed of an object? It can be
calculated, if we know the total distance covered by an object
and the time taken to cover it. The speed of an object is the total
distance covered divided by the total time taken to cover it. Thus,

Total distance covered
Total time taken
What would be the unit of speed? We know the SI units of
length and time. Since the speed is distance/time, the SI unit of
speed is metre/second and is expressed as m/s.
Speed can also be expressed in other units. If we express the
distance in kilometre and time in hour, then the unit of speed is
kilometre/hour, expressed as km/h.

 + Compare the speeds of the trains. Which is the fastest train?

The train which has covered the maximum distance in unit time
is the fastest train, that is, the one with the highest speed.

8.3.1 Relationship between speed, distance,
and time

We already know how to calculate speed using

Total distance covered

Speed. = _ _ _ 
Total time taken
if the distance travelled and time taken for it are known to us.
We can write this equation in a different form to calculate the
distance covered by an object, if we know its speed and the time
taken, by using
Total distance covered = Speed Total time taken

Similarly, we can also calculate the time an object will take to
cover a distance, if the distance and speed are given, by using
Total distance covered

Speed
Example 8.2: Raghav is going to a neighbouring city in a bus
moving at a speed of 50 km/h. If it takes him 2 h to reach that
city, how far is that city?

Solution: Distance covered by bus = Speed x Time

Total time taken =

km
= 50 x2hk
K

= 100 km

much time will it take to cover a distance of 360 km?

In all the examples so far, we have found the speed of an
object by using the total distance covered divided by the total
time taken . However, the object might not have travelled with
the same speed during the entire duration of time. The object
might have sometimes moved slower or sometimes faster. So, the
speed that we have calculated is the average speed, but, in this
book, we have used the term speed for average speed .

8.4 Uniform and Non-uniform Linear Motion
Oa hi ith ha lit ht heath heath helt ta tal

Do you remember learning about linear motion in the chapter
 Measurement of Length and Motion in the Grade 6 Science
textbook Curiosity? When an object moves along a straight line,
its motion is called linear motion. Now, imagine a train on a
track which is along a straight line between two adjacent railway
stations. So, the motion of the train between these two stations is
an example of linear motion (Fig. 8.11). The train starts from the
first station A at a slow speed, then moves at a faster speed, then
slows down and comes to a halt at the next station D. In between
the two stations, for some distance (B to C), the train moves at a
constant speed, that is, at an unchanging speed.

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7

Fig. 8.11: A train ona straight track

Chapter 8.indd 116 4/3/2025 4:54:46 PM

An object moving along a straight line with a constant speed
is said to be in uniform linear motion. So, the train is in uniform
motion between B and C (Fig. 8.11). On the other hand, if the speed
of an object moving along a straight line keeps changing, it is said
to be in non-uniform linear motion. The motion of the train
between A and B, as well as between C and D, is non-uniform
(Fig. 8.11).

An object in uniform linear motion covers equal distances
in equal intervals of time, while it covers unequal distances in
equal intervals of times when it is in non-uniform linear motion.
In Table 8.3, data are given for the distances travelled by two
trains, X and Y, between the time 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM.

Which of the two trains is in uniform linear motion between
10:00 AM and 11:00 AM? Train X covers equal distances in equal
intervals of time, so it is in uniform linear motion while Train Y
is in non-uniform linear motion.

Uniform linear motion is an idealisation. In everyday life,
we seldom find objects moving with a constant speed over long
distances or for long intervals of time. That is why we have to use
average speeds.

The time taken by the pendulum to complete one oscillation
is called its time period.

The time period of a simple pendulum of a given length is
constant at a place.

The SI unit of time is the second. Its symbol is s.

The average speed of an object is the total distance covered
divided by the total time taken to cover it.

An object moving along a straight line with a constant speed
is said to be in uniform linear motion.

If the speed of an object moving along a straight line keeps
changing, it is said to be in non-uniform linear motion.
