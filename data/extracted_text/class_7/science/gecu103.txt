Nihal and his classmates were excited for their school trip to the
Bhakra Nangal Dam. There they would visit the hydroelectric
power house where the force of falling water was used to generate
electricity. They also looked forward to the free 13 kilometretrain ride from Nangal in Punjab to Bhakra in Himachal Pradesh,
along the beautiful Sutlej river and through the Shivalik hills.

Prior to the trip, Nihal and his classmates were given a group
assignment to prepare a presentation on the uses of electricity.
They began by looking around their houses, then their school,
followed by their neighbourhood, their city, and finally they
searched the internet. To their astonishment, their list kept
growing. They decided to organise the uses under different
headings.

Can you help Nihal by adding some more uses to his lists?
Also, suggest some other ways of grouping the uses of electricity.
We use electricity all the time, so let us learn something more
about electricity. You have learnt earlier that electricity is
generated in multiple ways by windmills, by using wind
energy, by solar panels capturing the Sun s energy, by falling
water and by using natural gas or coal (in the chapter Nature s
Treasures in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity). The electric
supply from these sources reaches our homes and factories via
wires. For example, at home we plug in various devices to the
electrical sockets in the wall. However, to learn about electricity,
we will focus on a portable source of electricity that most of us
may have used. Let us start with its use in a common device like
a torchlight.
/\ Caution The danger signs on electric poles and
other appliances warn people that electricity can
be dangerous if not carefully handled. Never ever
perform experiments with power supply at your
home or school. Even electricity from portable
generators can be dangerous. Use only batteries or
cells, like those in torchlights, wall clocks, radios, or
remotes, for experiments with electricity.

3.1 A Torchlight
[ SSSENSS SS 2-22 oD)

You might have used a torchlight, also called a torch or a flashlight.

[Activity 3.1: Let us explore |

Take a torchlight similar to the one shown in Fig. 3.1.
Observe it carefully. Do you notice a lamp? And a switch?
Slide its switch and observe. Does the torch lamp glow?

Now slide the switch back to its original position and observe

the torch lamp.

3.2 A Simple Electrical Circuit

To understand how a torch works, let us first find out about its
components.

3.2.1 Electric cell

Activity 3.2: Let us observe | Positive Negative
terminal

. ; terminal
 * Take an electric cell, turn it around and look at epmune

it carefully (Fig. 3.2). Do you notice a positive
(+) sign and a negative ( ) sign marked on the + i 
electric cell? Do you also notice that it has a

small protruding metal cap on one side and a
flat metal disc on the other side?

Allelectric cells have two terminals; one is called positive (+ ve)
while the other is negative (-ve). The metal cap is the positive
terminal of the electric cell and the metal disc is the negative
terminal. The electric cell is a portable source of electrical energy.

In a torch, we generally
use more than one cell.
Are those placed in any
particular order?

[ Activity 3.3: Let us experiment |

 + Take a torch which uses two cells. Open its cell compartment
and take out the cells.

 + Put the cells back in a different order. Also, try reversing
the direction of one cell. Then, slide the switch and check
whether the lamp glows in each case.

 + Check the order in which the cells were placed in the torch
when the lamp glows.

The lamp glows when the cells are placed in the order as
shown in Fig. 3.3. Notice how the terminals of the two cells are
connected. The positive terminal of one cell is connected to the
negative terminal of the next cell. Such a combination of two or
more cells is called a battery.

For many devices, we may need more than one cell. So,
we connect two or more cells together as shown in Fig. 3.3.
Connecting more than one cell provides energy to the circuit for
a longer time and/or more energy.

FASCINATING FACTS

The term battery is also used for a single cell. We use the term battery
even for the single cell that powers our mobile phones.

For this activity, you will require a torchlight with an
incandescent lamp (or light bulb). Many old torchlights
still use such lamps. With your teacher s help, confirm
that your torchlight uses an incandescent lamp.
 + Take the torch and examine its lamp. What do you
see? Do you notice a thin wire fixed in the middle
of the glass bulb?

 + Now, switch on the torch. Which part of the lamp
glows?

The thin wire inside the glass bulb of the lamp glows.
The glowing thin wire is called the filament of the lamp.
** Take out the lamp with the help of your teacher and
inspect it from all sides. How is the filament fixed?

The filament is attached to two thicker wires that
support it, as shown in Fig. 3.4a. One thick wire connects
to the metal case at the lamp s base, while the other
connects to the metal tip at the centre of the base (Fig.
3.4b). These form the two terminals of the lamp, and
are fixed in a way that they do not touch each other.
In such incandescent lamps, the filament gets hot and
glows to produce light.

However, my torch has a
different kind of lamp. In fact, it
cannot be taken out of the torch
as it is fixed in it.

LED Lamp

Many torches in use today have a Light Emitting Diode (LED) lamp,
instead of an incandescent lamp, as shown in Fig. 3.5.

 + Notice the length of two wires attached to ,
the LED. Do you find one of those longer
than the other?

Unlike incandescent lamps, LEDs do not
have filaments (Fig. 3.6). They also have two
terminals, but one is positive (attached to a
longer wire) and the other is negative (the
shorter wire). A torch may use one or more Fig. 3.6: LEDs of different colours
LEDs, sometimes of different shapes, in its
lamp.

After having learnt about the electric cell, battery, and electric
lamps, we are now ready to make the torch lamp glow using an
electric cell or battery.

3.2.4 Making an electric lamp glow using an
electric cell or battery

 + We will conduct this activity in two parts prediction and
observation. Some of the ways in which the lamp and the cell

can be connected are shown in Table 3.1.

e Predict, for each arrangement, if the lamp will glow or
not and write your prediction in Table 3.1.

e Now, connect the lamp and the cell, and observe if the
lamp glows or not. Note down your observation in Table
3.1. Also, for the lamps which glow, colour their glass
bulbs yellow.

The lamp glows in the arrangements at S.No. 1 and 6 and does
not glow in the remaining arrangements. Now, carefully look at
the arrangements in which the lamp glows. Compare these with
those in which the lamp does not glow. Can you find the reason
for the difference?

3.2.5 An electrical circuit

The lamp glows when one terminal of the lamp is connected to

one terminal of the electric cell and the other terminal of the

lamp to the other terminal of the cell as shown in Fig. 3.9. This
setup forms an electrical circuit, which provides a
complete path for electric current to flow through
the lamp. The lamp glows only when current passes
through the circuit.

The direction of electric current in an electrical
circuit is taken to be from the positive to the negative
terminal of the electric cell. When the terminals of
the lamp are connected with those of the electric cell
by wires, the current passes through the filament
of the incandescent lamp and makes it glow. With
an incandescent lamp, it does not matter which of
its terminals connects to the positive or negative
terminal of the cell. The lamp will glow as long as

Fig. 3.9: Anelectrical circuit the circuit is complete and current flows through
the filament.

FASCINATING FACTS

Sometimes, an incandescent lamp does not glow even when
= connected to a cell. We say the lamp has fused usually due to
a broken filament. A broken filament stops the flow of current,
preventing the lamp from glowing.

Let us now try to make an LED glow.

| Activity 3.7: Let us experiment |

 + Take two electric cells, an LED of any colour, a cell holder
that can fit two cells (Fig. 3.8a), and two lengths of electric
wire.

 + Remove about 1 cm of the plastic covering from both ends of
each wire to expose the metal.

 > Connect the two wires to the cell holder as shown in
Fig. 3.10a.

4/3/2025 4:51:32 PM

Chapter 3.indd 31

 * Insert two cells in the holder, taking care
that for each cell, its negative terminal
is towards the spring side of the holder
(Fig. 3.10b) and the battery is ready to use.
How will you decide which is the positive
terminal of this battery? P|

The terminal ofthe holder whichisconnected |
to the positive terminal of one cell is positive
and the one connected to the negative terminal
of the other cell is the negative terminal. [

 + Now, connect the free end of the battery 
positive terminal wire to the longer wire of (a)
LED, and the free end of the second wire to
the shorter wire of LED (Fig. 3.10c). Does the
LED glow?

Repeat the above step but interchange the
wires connected to the LED (Fig. 3.10d).
Does the LED glow again?

You would have observed that the LED glows
in the first case (Fig. 3.10c) and does not glow in
the other (Fig. 3.10d). It is because the current
can pass through the LED in one direction only.
The current passes through the LED only when
the positive terminal (longer wire) of the LED is
connected to the positive terminal of the battery,
and negative terminal (shorter wire) of the LED

>,
~

is connected to the negative terminal of the (c)
battery. When current passes through the LED,

it glows. Always take care to connect an LED Fig. 3.10: Making an LED glow
correctly in a circuit to make it glow.

Sometimes you may come across a device in which the cells are placed
side by side. Then, how are the terminals of the cells connected? (

the battery compartment, you
will usually see a thick wire
or metal strip connecting the
positive terminal of one cell
to the negative terminal of
the next. To help with proper
placement, + and ~ symbols
are typically printed inside.

cy When the safety pin touches both drawing
@ pins, it closes the gap and completes the path, and
allows the current to flow. We call this the ON
position (Fig. 3.8b) where the circuit is closed
and current flows from the cell s positive to
negative terminal making the lamp glow. When
the safety pin does not touch the second drawing
pin, the gap in the circuit prevents current flow,
and the lamp does not glow. In this OFF position
(Fig. 3.8a), we say that the circuit is open.

 * Analyse your observations. Did the lamp glow for all
materials?

The lamp glows for some materials only. This means that
electric current can pass easily through some materials but not
through others. The materials through which electric current
can flow easily are called good conductors, or conductors of
electricity. The materials through which current cannot pass
through are called insulators, or poor conductors of electricity.

 + Based on the observations you have recorded in Table 3.3,
conclude which materials are conductors of electricity and
which are insulators. Note it in Table 3.3.

From your conclusions in Table 3.3, you would have realised
that metals are conductors of electricity, and thus, are used for
making wires.

)

) Silver, copper, and gold are the best electrical conductors.
However, for making electrical wires, mainly copper is used
due to its comparatively lower cost and abundant supply.
Different types of electrical wires are used for different uses.

\ Ay As ; S) Have you ever wondered how the electricity from a cell or

From Table 3.3, you would have also realised that plastic,
rubber, and ceramics are electrical insulators. Have you now
understood why wires are covered with those materials?

Conductors and insulators are both important. Electrical
wires, switches, connectors of plugs, and sockets are made of
conductors. Insulators like rubber, plastics, and ceramics are
used to cover wires, plug tops, and switches to protect people
from electric shocks.

Caution Our body is a conductor of electricity. Electric current
passing through our body may cause severe injury or even death.
Always handle electrical appliances with care. Never touch switches or
plugs with wet hands, or use electrical devices in wet areas, or handle
equipment with damaged insulation or broken plugs.

battery is different from the electricity coming from a wall
socket? Electricity from batteries usually powers small
devices and is of a type called Direct Current (DC). In contrast,
the electricity from power plants that come to the wall socket
is known as Alternating Current (AC) and can run larger
appliances.

In a Nutshell
(CSSSENS Sooo

An electric cell is a portable source of electrical energy.

An electric cell has two terminals; one is called positive (+ve)
while the other is negative (ve).

In an incandescent electric lamp, there is a thin wire called
the filament, which gets hot and glows to produce light when
electric current passes through it.

An LED has two terminals, one is positive (attached to a
longer wire) and the other is negative (the shorter wire).

Electric current can pass through LED in one direction only.

An LED lights up only when its positive terminal (longer
wire) connects to the positive terminal of the battery and
its negative terminal (shorter wire) connects to the negative
terminal of the battery.

A switch is a simple device that either completes or breaks a
circuit.

The direction of electric current in a closed electrical circuit
is taken to be from the positive to the negative terminal of
the electric cell.

A representation of an electrical circuit using symbols is
called its circuit diagram.

Materials through which electric current can flow easily are
called good conductors or conductors of electricity.
Materials through which current cannot pass through are
called insulators or poor conductors of electricity.
