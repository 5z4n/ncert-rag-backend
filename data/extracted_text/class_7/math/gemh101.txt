1.1 PROPERTIES OF ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION OF
INTEGERS
We have learnt about whole numbers and integers in Class VI. We have also learnt about

addition and subtraction of integers.

1.1.1 Closure under Addition

We have learnt that sum of two whole numbers is again a whole number. For example,
17 +24=41 which is again a whole number. We know that, this property is known as the

closure property for addition of the whole numbers.
Let us see whether this property is true for integers or not.
Following are some pairs of integers. Observe the following table and complete it.

Statement Observation
@) 17+23=40 Result is an integer
@i) (-10)+3=___
(ii) ( 75)+18=_
(iv) 19+( 25) =-6 Result is an integer
(v) 27+(-27)=__
(vi) ( 20)+0=_

(vil) (~ 35) +( 10) =___

What do you observe? Is the sum of two integers always an integer?

Did you find a pair of integers whose sum is not an integer?

Since addition of integers gives integers, we say integers are closed under addition.
In general, for any two integers a and b, a + b is an integer.

1.1.2 Closure under Subtraction

What happens when we subtract an integer from another integer? Can we say that their
difference is also an integer?

Observe the following table and complete it:

Statement Observation

Gi) 7-9=-2 Result is an integer

@) 17 (-21)=__ OO
(ii) (- 8) -(-14) =6 Result is an integer
(iv) ( 21)-(- 10) =___

(v) 32-(-17)=
(vi) ( 18)-( 18) =__
(vil) ( 29)-O=____

What do you observe? Is there any pair of integers whose difference is not an integer?
Can we Say integers are closed under subtraction? Yes, we can see that integers are
closed under subtraction.

Thus, ifa and b are two integers then a- b is also an intger. Do the whole numbers
satisfy this property?

1.1.3 Commutative Property
We know that 3 +5 =5 +3 =8, that is, the whole numbers can be added in any order. In
other words, addition is commutative for whole numbers.
Can we say the same for integers also?
We have 5 + ( 6) = 1 and (-6)+5=-1
So, 5+ ( 6) =( 6)+5
Are the following equal?
(i) ( 8) +( 9) and ( 9) + (- 8)
(ii) ( 23) +32 and 32 + ( 23)
(ii) ( 45)+0 and 0 + ( 45)

Try this with five other pairs of integers. Do you find any pair of integers for which the
sums are different when the order is changed? Certainly not. We say that addition is
commutative for integers.

2024-25

INTEGERS i

In general, for any two integers a and b, we can say
at+b=b+a

@ We know that subtraction is not commutative for whole numbers. Is it commutative
for integers?
Consider the integers 5 and ( 3).
Is 5 (3) the same as ( 3) -5? No, because 5 (-3) =5 +3 = 8, and (-3) 5
=-3-5=-8.
Take atleast five different pairs of integers and check this.

We conclude that subtraction is not commutative for integers.

1.1.4 Associative Property

Observe the following examples:

Consider the integers 3, 2 and 5.

Look at ( 5) + [(-3) + (-2)] and [( 5) + (-3)] + (2).

In the first sum ( 3) and ( 2) are grouped together and in the second ( 5) and ( 3)
are grouped together. We will check whether we get different results.

(3) +2) (2) (5) +)

 10 5 0 -10 -8 0
(-5) + [(-3) + (-2)] [(-5) + (-3)] + 2)
In both the cases, we get 10.
ie., (-5) + [-3) + @2)] = [(-5) + -2)] + C3)
Similarly consider 3 , | and 7.
(-3)+ [1+ (-7)]=-3 + =
[((-3) + 1] + (<7) =-2 + =
Is (-3) + [1 + (-7)] same as [(-3) + 1] + (-7)?
Take five more such examples. You will not find any example for which the sums are
different. Addition is associative for integers.

In general for any integers a, b andc, we can say
at+(b+c)=(at+b)+c

1.1.5 Additive Identity

When we add zero to any whole number, we get the same whole number. Zero is an
additive identity for whole numbers. Is it an additive identity again for integers also?

Observe the following and fill in the blanks:

(i) (-8)+0 =-8 (i) O+( 8)=-8
(i) (-23)+0=_ (iv) 0+ (-37) =-37
(v) 0+(-59)=_ (vii) O+_ = - 43
(vi) 61+ =-61 (viii) +0=

The above examples show that zero is an additive identity for integers.
You can verify it by adding zero to any other five integers.
In general, for any integer a

a+O=a=O0+a

(c) aninteger smaller than both the integers. (d) aninteger smaller than only one of the integers.
(e) aninteger greater than both the integers.

1.2 MULTIPLICATION OF INTEGERS

We can add and subtract integers. Let us now learn how to multiply integers.

1.2.1 Multiplication of a Positive and a Negative Integer

We know that multiplication of whole numbers is repeated addition. For example,

54+54+5=3x5=15

Can you represent addition of integers in the same way?

We have from the following number line, ( 5) + ( 5) + (-5) =-15

Find:
4x ( 8),

 20 15 10 5 0 3 x (-7),
10 x 1)
But we can also write using number line.

(-5) + (5) + (5) =3 x5)

Therefore, 3 x (-5) =-15

Similarly ( 4)+ 4)+(-4)+C 4)+@ 4)=5x (C4) =-20

 _$ EEE

20 16 12 -8 4 0

And (-3) + (3) + (-3) +3) = =
Also, (7) +(-1)+(-T)= =

Let us see how to find the product of a positive integer and a negative integer without
using number line.

Let us find 3 x ( 5) in a different way. First find 3 x 5 and then put minus sign ( )
before the product obtained. You get 15. That is we find (3 x 5) to get -15.

Similarly, 5 x ( 4) = (5x4) = 20.
Find ina similar way,
4x(-8)=_ = X(T) = =
6x(-5)= = 2x(-9)= =
Using this method we thus have,
10x (43) 0x 4) = 430
Find: Till now we multiplied integers as (positive integer) x (negative integer).
 eI) Let us now multiply them as (negative integer) x (positive integer).
@ 12x32) We first find -3 x 5.
(iit) 7 x ( 22)

To find this, observe the following pattern:

We have, 3x5=15
2x5=10=15-5
1x5=5=10-5
0x5=0=5-5

So, -1x5=0-5=-5

 2x5=-5-5=-10
 3x5=-10-5=-15

We already have 3 x (-5) =-15

So we get (-3) x 5 =-15 =3 x (-5)

Using such patterns, we also get ( 5) x 4= 20 =5 x ( 4)

Using patterns, find ( 4) x 8, ( 3) x 7, (- 6) x 5 and ( 2) x9

Check whether, ( 4) x 8=4 x ( 8), (-3) x 7=3 x (-7), (-6) x 5 =6x ( 5)

2024-25

INTEGERS

and (-2)x9=2~x(-9)
Using this we get, ( 33) x 5 = 33 x (-5) =-165

We thus find that while multiplying a positive integer and a negative integer, we
multiply them as whole numbers and put a minus sign ( ) before the product. We
thus get a negative integer.

1. Find: (a) 15 x(-16) (b) 21 x(-32)
(c) ( 42)x 12 (d) -55 x 15
2. Checkif (a) 25 x (-21)=(-25)x21 = (b) (-23) x 20=23 x (20)

Write five more such examples.

In general, for any two positive integers a and b we can say
ax ( b) =(-a) x b=-(axb)

1.2.2 Multiplication of two Negative Integers
Can you find the product ( 3) x ( 2)?
Observe the following:

-3x4=-12

-3 x3 =-9 =-12-(-3)

 3 x2 =-6=-9-(-3)

3x | =-3 = 6-(-3)

-3x0=0 =-3-(-3)

3 x-1=0-(-3)=04+3=3

 3 x -2=3-(-3)=34+3=6

Do you see any pattern? Observe how the products change.

Based on this observation, complete the following:

 3x3= 3x-4=_ 
Now observe these products and fill in the blanks:
-4x4=-16
 -4x3=-12 =-16+4
-4x2=_ = -124+4

-4x(-2)=__ Gi) Starting from ( 6) x 3, find ( 6) x (7)
 4x (3)=____

From these patterns we observe that,
(-3) x (-l)=3 =3x1
(-3) x (-2)=6=3x2
(-3) x (-3)=9=3 x3

and ( 4)x(-l)=4=4x1

So, (-4)x(-2)=4x2 =__
(-4)x(3)=_ =

So observing these products we can say that the product of two negative integers is
a positive integer. We multiply the two negative integers as whole numbers and put
the positive sign before the product.

Thus, we have (-10) x (-12) = + 120 = 120
Similarly ( 15) x (-6) = + 90 = 90
In general, for any two positive integers a and b,

(-a)x( b)=axb

1.3 PROPERTIES OF MULTIPLICATION OF INTEGERS

1.3.1 Closure under Multiplication
1. Observe the following table and complete it:

What do you observe? Can you find a pair of integers whose product is not an integer?
No. This gives us an idea that the product of two integers is again an integer. So we can
say that integers are closed under multiplication.

In general,
ax bisan integer, for all integers a and b.

Find the product of five more pairs of integers and verify the above statement.

is also commutative for integers?

INTEGERS i

What are your observations? The above examples suggest multiplication is
commutative for integers. Write five more such examples and verify.

In general, for any two integers a and b,

axb=bxa

1.3.3 Multiplication by Zero

We know that any whole number when multiplied by zero gives zero. Observe the following
products of negative integers and zero. These are obtained from the patterns done earlier.

(-3) x0=0
0x (-4)=0
-5x0=__
0x (-6)=___

This shows that the product of a negative integer and zero is zero.
In general, for any integer a,
ax0=0xa=0

1.3.4 Multiplicative Identity

We know that | is the multiplicative identity for whole numbers.

Check that 1 is the multiplicative identity for integers as well. Observe the following
products of integers with 1.

(-3)x1=-3 1x5=5

(-4)x1l=__ Ix8=_
Ix(5)=_ 3x1=___
1x(-6)=___ Tx1l=_

This shows that 1 is the multiplicative identity for integers also.
In general, for any integer a we have,

axl=1xa=a

What happens when we multiply any integer with 1? Complete the following:

(-3) x (1) =3
3 x (-1) =-3

0 is the additive identity whereas 1 is the
(6) x Cl) = ___ multiplicative identity for integers. We get
(-1) x 13 =___ additive inverse of an integer a when we multiply
(-1) x (-25)= (-1) toa,ie. ax (-l1)=(-1) Xa=-a
18 x (-1)=

1.3.5 Associativity for Multiplication

Consider 3, 2 and 5.
Look at [( 3) x (-2)] x 5 and ( 3) x [(-2) x 5].

In the first case ( 3) and ( 2) are grouped together and in the second ( 2) and 5 are
grouped together.

We see that [(-3) x (-2)] x 5=6x5=30
and (-3) x [( 2) x 5] = (-3) x (-10) = 30 oF
So, we get the same answer in both the cases. *
Thus, [(-3) x (-2)] x 5=(-3) x [(-2) x 5]
Look at this and complete the products:
[(7) x (-6)] x4= x4=
7x [(-6) x4] =7x =
Is [7 x (-6)] x 4=7 x [( 6) x 4]?
Does the grouping of integers affect the product of integers? No.

In general, for any three integers a, b andc
(ax b)xc=ax(bxc)

Take any five values for a, b and c each and verify this property.

Thus, like whole numbers, the product of three integers does not depend upon
the grouping of integers and this is called the associative property for multiplication
of integers.

1.3.6 Distributive Property

We know
16 x (10+ 2) = (16 x 10) + (16 x 2) [Distributivity of multiplication over addition]
Let us check if this is true for integers also.
Observe the following:
(a) (-2) x (3+5)=-2x8=-16
and = [( 2) x 3] + [(-2) x 5] = (- 6) + (10) =-16
So, (-2) x (3. +5) =[(-2) x 3] + [(-2) x 5]
(b) ( 4) x [(-2) + 7] = ( 4) x 5 =-20
and = [( 4) x (-2)]+[(-4) x 7]= 8 +(-28) =-20
So, ( 4) x [(-2) +7] =[C 4) x -2)] + 1-4) x 7]
(c) (~8) x [(-2) + (-D] = (- 8) x (3) = 24
and = [( 8) x (-2)] + [- 8) x (-l] = 16 +8 =24
So, ( 8) x [(-2) +(-]I)] =[- 8) x (-2)] +[C 8) x CD]

INTEGERS i

Can we say that the distributivity of multiplication over addition is true for integers
also? Yes.

In general, for any integers a, b and c,

Take atleast five different values for each of a, b and c and verify the above Distributive
property.

(i) Is 10 x [((6+ (-2)] = 10x 6+ 10x (-2)?
(i) Is ( 15) x [((-7) + (-1)] = 15) x (-7) + 15) x (-1)?

Now consider the following:
Can we say 4 x (3-8) =4x3-4~x 8?
Let us check:
4x (3-8) =4x (-5) =-20
4x3-4x8=12 -32=-20
So, 4x(3-8)=4x3-4.x8.
Look at the following:
(-5) x [(-4) (-6)] =(-S) x2 = -10
[(-5) x ( 4)] -[(-5) x (- 6)] =20 -30= -10
So, (-5)x[(-4) (-6)] =[(-5) x (-4)] -[(-5) x (-9)]
Check this for ( 9) x [ 10 ( 3)] and [(-9) x 10 ] [ (-9) x (-3)]
You will find that these are also equal.

In general, for any three integers a, b and c,
ax(b-c)=axb-axc

Take atleast five different values for each of a, b and c and verify this property.

Justify it by taking five more examples of your own.

@ We know that division is not commutative for whole numbers. Let us check it for

integers also.

You can see from the table that ( 8) + (-4) # (-4) + 8).
Is (-9) + 3 the same as 3 + (9)?

Is ( 30) + (6) the same as ( 6) + ( 30)?

Can we say that division is commutative for integers? No.
You can verify it by taking five more pairs of integers.

Like whole numbers, any integer divided by zero is meaningless and zero divided by
an integer other than zero is equal to zero i.e., for any integer a, a + Ois not defined
but0 +a=0 fora #0.

When we divide a whole number by | it gives the same whole number. Let us check
whether it is true for negative integers also.

Observe the following :
( 8)+1=(C8) (-11l)+1=-11 (-13) +1 =-13
(-25)+1l=___ (-37) +1 =___ ( 48)+1=___

This shows that negative integer divided by 1 gives the same negative integer.
So, any integer divided by I gives the same integer.

In general, for any integer a,
a+l=a

What happens when we divide any integer by (1)? Complete the following table

(-8)+C1)=8 11+(-1)=-l1 13+(-1l)=_

Can we say [( 16) + 4] + ( 2) is the same as ( 16) + [4 + (-2)]?
We know that [(-16) + 4] = (-2) =(-4) + 2) =2

EXAMPLE 2 Inatest (+5) marks are given for every correct answer and ( 2) marks
are given for every incorrect answer. (i) Radhika answered all the questions
and scored 30 marks though she got 10 correct answers. (ii) Jay also
answered all the questions and scored ( 12) marks though he got 4
correct answers. How many incorrect answers had they attempted?

SOLUTION

(i) Marks given for one correct answer = 5
So, marks given for 10 correct answers = 5 x 10 =50
Radhika s score = 30
Marks obtained for incorrect answers = 30 50 = 20
Marks given for one incorrect answer = ( 2)
Therefore, number of incorrect answers = ( 20) + (-2) = 10
(ii) Marks given for 4 correct answers = 5 X 4= 20

Jay s score = 12

Marks obtained for incorrect answers = 12 20 =- 32
Marks given for one incorrect answer = ( 2)
Therefore number of incorrect answers = ( 32) + (-2) = 16
EXAMPLE 3 A shopkeeper earns a profit of = 1 by selling one pen and incurs a loss
of 40 paise per pencil while selling pencils of her old stock.

(i) Inaparticular month she incurs a loss of 5. In this period, she sold 45 pens. How
many pencils did she sell in this period?

(ii) Inthe next month she earns neither profit nor loss. If she sold 70 pens, how many
pencils did she sell?

SOLUTION

(i) Profit earned by selling one pen = 1
Profit earned by selling 45 pens = = 45, which we denote by +% 45
Total loss given = 5, which we denote by =5

Profit earned + Loss incurred = Total loss
Therefore, Loss incurred = Total Loss Profit earned
= ( 5 45) =? (50) = 5000 paise
Loss incurred by selling one pencil = 40 paise which we write as 40 paise
So, number of pencils sold = ( 5000) + ( 40) = 125

(ii) Inthe next month there is neither profit nor loss.

So, Profit earned + Loss incurred = 0
i.e., Profit earned = Loss incurred.
Now, profit earned by selling 70 pens == 70

Hence, loss incurred by selling pencils = % 70 which we indicate by 

= 70 or 7,000 paise.

Total number of pencils sold = (7000) + ( 40) = 175 pencils.

INTEGERS iE

WHuaT HAVE WE DISCUSSED?

. Wenow study the properties satisfied by addition and subtraction.

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

Integers are closed for addition and subtraction both. That is, a + b and
a- bare again integers, where a and bare any integers.

Addition is commutative for integers, i.e, a+ b=b +a for all integers
aand b.

Addition is associative for integers, i.e., (a +b)+c=a+(b+c) for all integers
a, band c.

Integer 0 is the identity under addition. That is, a+0=0+a=a for every

integer a.

. Westudied, how integers could be multiplied, and found that product of a positive

and a negative integer is a negative integer, whereas the product of two negative

integers is a positive integer. For example, 2 x 7= 14 and 3 x 8 =24.

. Product of even number of negative integers is positive, whereas the product of odd

number of negative integers is negative.

. Integers show some properties under multiplication.

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

Integers are closed under multiplication. That is, a x b is an integer for any two
integers a and b.

Multiplication is commutative for integers. That is, ax b=b xa for any integers
aand b.

The integer | is the identity under multiplication, 1.e., 1 x a=ax 1 =a for any
integer a.

Multiplication is associative for integers, 1.e., (a x b) x c=ax (bx c) for any
three integers a, b and c.

. Under addition and multiplication, integers show a property called distributive

property. That is, ax (b+c)=axb+axc for any three integers a, b and c.

. The properties of commutativity, associativity under addition and multiplication, and

the distributive property help us to make our calculations easier.

. Wealso learnt how to divide integers. We found that,

(a)

(b)

When a positive integer is divided by a negative integer, the quotient obtained is
negative and vice-versa.
Division of a negative integer by another negative integer gives positive as quotient.

. Forany integer a, we have
