5.1 INTRODUCTION

You already know how to identify different lines, line segments and angles in a given
shape. Can you identify the different line segments and angles formed in the following
figures? (Fig 5.1)

(iv)
Fig 5.1
Can you also identify whether the angles made are acute or obtuse or right?

Recall that a line segment has two end points. If we extend the two end points in either
direction endlessly, we get a line. Thus, we can say that a line has no end points. On the other
hand, recall that a ray has one end point (namely its starting point). For example, look at the
figures given below: Q

(i)

Fig 5.2
Here, Fig 5.2 (1) shows a line segment, Fig 5.2 (ii) shows a line and Fig 5.2 (iii) is that
of aray. A line segment PQ is generally denoted by the symbol PQ, a line AB is denoted by

the symbol AB and the ray OP is denoted by OP . Give some examples of line segments and
rays from your daily life and discuss them with your friends.

LINES AND ANGLES

Again recall that an angle is formed when lines or line segments meet. In Fig 5.1,
observe the corners. These corners are formed when two lines or line segments intersect
at a point. For example, look at the figures given below:

Fig 5.3
In Fig 5.3 (i) line segments AB and BC intersect at B to form angle y, ah
ABC, and again line segments BC and AC intersect at C to form angle
ACB and so on. Whereas, in Fig 5.3 (11) lines PQ and RS intersect at O Ftay Tass

represented by the symbol ZABC. Thus, in Fig 5.3 (i), the three angles and identify the acute, obtuse
formed are ZABC, ZBCA and ZBAC, and in Fig 5.3 (ii), the four andright angles found in them.
angles formed are ZPOS, ZSOQ, ZQOR and ZPOR. You have already

studied how to classify the angles as acute, obtuse or right angle.

Note: While referring to the measure of an angle ABC, we shall write mZABC as simply
ZABC. The context will make it clear, whether we are referring to the angle or its
measure.

5.3.2 Transversal

You might have seen a road crossing two or more roads or a railway line crossing several
other lines (Fig 5.10). These give an idea of a transversal.

(i) Fig 5.10 (it)
A line that intersects two or more lines at distinct points is called a transversal.
In the Fig 5.11, p is a transversal to the lines / and m.

5.3.4 Transversal of Parallel Lines

Do you remember what parallel lines are? They are lines on a plane that do not meet
anywhere. Can you identify parallel lines in the following figures? (Fig 5.16)

Fig 5.16

Transversals of parallel lines give rise to quite interesting results.

Take a ruled sheet of paper. Draw (in thick colour) two parallel lines / and m.
Draw a transversal t to the lines / and m. Label 21 and 22 as shown [Fig 5.17()]. &
Place a tracing paper over the figure drawn. Trace the lines /, m and t.

Slide the tracing paper along , until / coincides with m.

You find that 71 on the traced figure coincides with 22 of the original figure.
In fact, you can see all the following results by similar tracing and sliding activity. J

This activity illustrates the following fact:

If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, each pair of corresponding angles are
equal in measure.

We use this result to get another interesting result. Look at Fig 5.18.

When ft cuts the parallel lines, /, m, we get, 23 = Z7 (vertically opposite angles).
But 27 = Z8 (corresponding angles). Therefore, 23 = 28 57 ]

You can similarly show that 271 = 26. Thus, we 3,1
have the following result :

If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, each 6 8 m
pair of alternate interior angles are equal. 42

This second result leads to another interesting
property. Again, from Fig 5.18. Fig 5.18

2024-25

EE a i emarics

23+ Z1 =180 (23 and 21 form a linear pair)

But 21 = 46 (A pair of alternate interior angles)

Therefore, we can say that 23 + 26 = 180 .

Similarly, 71+ 28 = 180 . Thus, we obtain the following result:

If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then each pair of interior angles on the same
side of the transversal are supplementary.

You can very easily remember these results if you can look for relevant shapes .

The F-shape stands for corresponding angles:

at

 !|

The Z - shape stands for alternate angles.

Draw a pair of parallel lines and a transversal. Verify the above three statements by actually measuring
the angles.

5.4 CHECKING FOR PARALLEL LINES
If two lines are parallel, then you know that a transversal gives rise to
pairs of equal corresponding angles, equal alternate interior angles
and interior angles on the same side of the transversal being
supplementary.
When two lines are given, is there any method to check if they are
parallel or not? You need this skill in many life-oriented situations.
A draftsman uses a carpenter s square and a straight edge (ruler)
to draw these segments (Fig 5.19). He claims they are parallel. How?
Are you able to see that he has kept the corresponding angles to Fig 5.19
be equal? (What is the transversal here?)
Thus, when a transversal cuts two lines, such that pairs of
corresponding angles are equal, then the lines have to be parallel.
Look at the letter Z(Fig 5.20). The horizontal segments here are
parallel, because the alternate angles are equal. ZA
When a transversal cuts two lines, such that pairs of alternate
interior angles are equal, the lines have to be parallel. Fig 5.20

2024-25

EE i ematics

Draw a line / (Fig 5.21).

Draw a line m, perpendicular to /. Again draw a line p, )

such that p is perpendicular to m.

Thus, p is perpendicular to a perpendicular to /.

You find p Il 1. How? This is because you draw p such Fig 5.21
that 71 + 22 = 180 .

Thus, when a transversal cuts two lines, such that pairs of interior angles on the
same side of the transversal are supplementary, the lines have to be parallel.
