2.1 MULTIPLICATION OF FRACTIONS

You know how to find the area of a rectangle. It is equal to length x breadth. If the length
and breadth of a rectangle are 7 cm and 4 cm respectively, then what will be its area? Its
area would be 7 x 4 = 28 cm .
What will be the area of the rectangle if its length and breadth are 7 zm and

1 . oD Lol 15 7 15
35 cm respectively? You will say it will be 7 5 x 3 5 = XG cm . The numbers >
and 5 are fractions. To calculate the area of the given rectangle, we need to know how to

multiply fractions. We shall learn that now.

Note that 0.1 occurs two times in the product. In 0.1 there is eet fff fd

one digit to the right of the decimal point. In 0.01 there are two
digits (i.e., 1 + 1) to the right of the decimal point.

of these three equal parts into 10 equal parts and take two from each. We get 10 x 10

10 x = or 0.2 x 0.3. (Fig 2.15)

Since there are 6 dotted squares out of 100, so they also reprsent 0.06.
Thus, 0.2 x 0.3 = 0.06.

Observe that 2 x 3 = 6 and the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in 0.06
is2(=1+1).

The dotted squares represent

Check whether this applies to 0.1 x 0.1 also.
Find 0.2 x 0.4 by applying these observations.
While finding 0.1 x 0.1 and 0.2 x 0.3, you might have noticed that first we multiplied

them as whole numbers ignoring the decimal point. In 0.1 x 0.1, we found 01 x 01 or 1 x
1. Similarly in 0.2 x 0.3 we found 02 x 03 or 2 x 3.

Then, we counted the number of digits starting from the rightmost digit and moved
towards left. We then put the decimal point there. The number of digits to be counted is
obtained by adding the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in the decimal
numbers that are being multiplied.

Let us now find 1.2 x 2.5.

Multiply 12 and 25. We get 300. Both, in 1.2 and 2.5, there is | digit to the right of the
decimal point. So, count 1 + 1 =2 digits from the rightmost digit (i.e., 0) in 300 and move
towards left. We get 3.00 or 3.

Find in a similar way 1.5 x 1.6, 2.4 x 4.2.

While multiplying 2.5 and 1.25, you will first multiply 25 and 125. For placing the
decimal in the product obtained, you will count 1 + 2=3 (Why?) digits starting from the
rightmost digit. Thus, 2.5 x 1.25 =3.225

Observe the shift of the decimal point of the products in the table. Here the numbers are
multiplied by 10,100 and 1000. In 1.76 x 10= 17.6, the digits are same 1.e., 1,7 and 6. Do
you observe this in other products also? Observe 1.76 and 17.6. To which side has the
decimal point shifted, right or left? The decimal point has shifted to the right by one place.
Note that 10 has one zero over 1.

In 1.76x100 = 176.0, observe 1.76 and 176.0. To which side and by how many
digits has the decimal point shifted? The decimal point has shifted to the right by two
places.

Note that 100 has two zeros over one.

Do you observe similar shifting of decimal point in other products also?

So we say, when a decimal number is multiplied by 10, 100 or 1000, the digits in

the product are same as in the decimal number but the decimal point in the product
is shifted to the right by as, many of places as there are zeros over one.

Savita was preparing a design to decorate her classroom. She needed a few coloured
strips of paper of length 1.9 cm each. She had a strip of coloured paper of length 9.5 cm.
How many pieces of the required length will she get out of this strip? She thought it would

be - cm. Is she correct?

Both 9.5 and 1.9 are decimal numbers. So we need to know the division of

decimal numbers too!

2.4.1 Division by 10, 100 and 1000

Let us find the division of a decimal number by 10, 100 and 1000.
Consider 31.5 = 10.

FRACTIONS AND DECIMALS ii PE RTT

31.5 +10 315 4 31 3.15
 ee 10 10 ~ 100 
Similarly, 31.5100 =x I 3b = 0.315
10 100 1000

Let us see if we can find a pattern for dividing numbers by 10, 100 or 1000. This may
help us in dividing numbers by 10, 100 or 1000 in a shorter way.
31.5 + 10 = 3.15 231.5+10=__ 15+10=__ | 29.36+10=__
31.5+100=0.315 | 231.5+10=__ 15+100=__ | 29.36+100=__

31.5 +1000 = 0.0315] 231.5 + 1000 =___ | 1.5+1000=___ | 29.36 +1000 =___

Take 31.5 + 10 = 3.15. In 31.5 and 3.15, the digits are
same i.e., 3, 1, and 5 but the decimal point has shifted in the

quotient. To which side and by how many digits? The decimal ; ;

point has shifted to the left by one place. Note that 10 has one we ee ae

zero over 1. f a Gi) 235.4 +100
Consider now 31.5 + 100 = 0.315. In 31.5 and 0.315 the a (iii) 235.4 + 1000

digits are same, but what about the decimal point in the quotient?

It has shifted to the left by two places. Note that 100 has two

zeros over].

So we can say that, while dividing a number by 10, 100 or 1000, the digits of the
number and the quotient are same but the decimal point in the quotient shifts to the

left by as many places as there are zeros over 1. Using this observation let us now
quickly find: 2.38 = 10 = 0.238, 2.38 + 100 = 0.0238, 2.38 + 1000 = 0.00238

2.4.2 Division of a Decimal Number by a Whole Number

Let us find . Remember we also write it as 6.4 + 2. Try THESE

Qi) 35.7+3=?;
64 64 = 1 @) 25.5+3=?

So, 6.4+2 = To +2= 10 2 as learnt in fractions.

64x1 1x64 1 = 64 ~= #1 32
= = = x = x 32 =a 3.2
10x2 10x2 10 2 10 10
Or, let us first divide 64 by 2. We get 32. There is one digit to the right of the decimal
point in 6.4. Place the decimal in 32 such that there would be one digit to its

right. We get 3.2 again.

To find 19.5 +5, first find 195 +5. We get 39. There is one digit to the :
right of the decimal point in 19.5. Place the decimal point in 39 such that there @) 43.15+5=%;
would be one digit to its right. You will get 3.9. (ii) 82.44+6=?

the decimal in 12.96. Making similar placement of the decimal in 324, you
will get 3.24.

Note that here and in the next section, we have considered only those divisions in
which, ignoring the decimal, the number would be completely divisible by another number
to give remainder zero. Like, in 19.5 + 5, the number 195 when divided by 5, leaves
remainder zero.

However, there are situations in which the number may not be completely divisible by
another number, i.e., we may not get remainder zero. For example, 195 +7. We deal with
such situations in later classes.

Wehave 25.5 +0.5 10 10 105 51. Thus, 25.5+0.5=51

What do you observe? For ~ , we find that there is one digit to the right of the

5.5
0.5 
decimal in 0.5. This could be converted to whole number by dividing by 10. Accordingly
25.5 was also converted to a fraction by dividing by 10.

Or, we say the decimal point was shifted by one place to the right in 0.5 to make it 5.
So, there was a shift of one decimal point to the right in 25.5 also to make it 255.

For example, 22S=2x2= 

(b) While dividing a fraction by a whole number we multiply the fraction by the
reciprocal of the whole number.

To multiply a decimal number by 10, 100 or 1000, we move the decimal point in the
number to the right by as many places as there are zeros over 1.

Thus 0.53 x 10=5.3, 0.53 x 100=53, 0.53 x 1000 = 530

We have seen how to divide decimal numbers.

(a) To divide a decimal number by a whole number, we first divide them as whole
numbers. Then place the decimal point in the quotient as in the decimal number.
For example, 8.4+4=2.1
Note that here we consider only those divisions in which the remainder is zero.

(b) To divide a decimal number by 10, 100 or 1000, shift the digits in the decimal
number to the left by as many places as there are zeros over 1, to get the
quotient.
So, 23.9 + 10 = 2.39,23.9 + 100 = 0 .239, 23.9 + 1000 = 0.0239

(c) While dividing two decimal numbers, first shift the decimal point to the right by
equal number of places in both, to convert the divisor to a whole number. Then
divide. Thus, 2.4 +0.2 =24+2=12.
