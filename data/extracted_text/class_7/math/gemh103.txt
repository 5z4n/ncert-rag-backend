3.1 REPRESENTATIVE VALUES

You might be aware of the term average and would have come across statements involving
the term average in your day-to-day life:

@ Isha spends on an average of about 5 hours daily for her studies.

@ The average temperature at this time of the year is about 40 degree celsius.

@ The average age of pupils in my class is 12 years.

@ The average attendance of students in a school during its final examination was

98 per cent.

Many more of such statements could be there. Think about the statements given above.
Do you think that the child in the first statement studies exactly for 5 hours daily?
Or, is the temperature of the given place during that particular time always 40 degrees?

Or, is the age of each pupil in that class 12 years? Obviously not.

Then what do these statements tell you?

By average we understand that Isha, usually, studies for 5 hours. On some days, she
may study for less number of hours and on the other days she may study longer.

Similarly, the average temperature of 40 degree celsius, means that, very often, the
temperature at this time of the year is around 40 degree celsius. Sometimes, it may be less
than 40 degree celsius and at other times, it may be more than 40 C.

Thus, we realise that average is anumber that represents or shows the central tendency
of a group of observations or data. Since average lies between the highest and the lowest
value of the given data so, we say average is a measure of the central tendency of the
group of data. Different forms of data need different forms of representative or central
value to describe it. One of these representative values is the Arithmetic mean . You
will learn about the other representative values in the later part of the chapter.

3.2 ARITHMETIC MEAN

The most common representative value of a group of data is the arithmetic mean or the
mean. To understand this in a better way, let us look at the following example:

Two vessels contain 20 litres and 60 litres of milk respectively. What is the amount that
each vessel would have, if both share the milk equally? When we ask this question we are
seeking the arithmetic mean.

In the above case, the average or the arithmetic mean would be

Total quantity of milk 20+60

Number of vessels 2 litres = 40 litres.

Thus, each vessels would have 40 litres of milk.
The average or Arithmetic Mean (A.M.) or simply mean is defined as follows:

Sum of all observations
number of observations

mean =
Consider these examples.

EXAMPLE 1 Ashish studies for 4 hours, 5 hours and 3 hours respectively on three
consecutive days. How many hours does he study daily on an average?

SOLUTION The average study time of Ashish would be
Total number of study hours 44543

Number of days for which he studied ~ 3
Thus, we can say that Ashish studies for 4 hours daily on an average.

hours = 4 hours per day

Examp.e 2 A batsman scored the following number of runs in six innings:
36, 35, 50, 46, 60, 55

Calculate the mean runs scored by him in an inning.

SOLUTION Total runs = 36 + 35 +50 + 46 + 60 + 55 = 282.

To find the mean, we find the sum of all the observations and divide it by the number of
observations.
Therefore, in this case, mean = 6 = 47. Thus, the mean runs scored in an inning are 47.

3.2.1 Range

The difference between the highest and the lowest observation gives us an idea of the
spread of the observations. This can be found by subtracting the lowest observation from
the highest observation. We call the result the range of the observation. Look at the
following example:
EXAMPLE 3 The ages in years of 10 teachers of a school are:
32, 41, 28, 54, 35, 26, 23, 33, 38, 40

(ii) What is the range of the ages of the teachers?

(ii) What is the mean age of these teachers?

SOLUTION
(i) Arranging the ages in ascending order, we get:
23, 26, 28, 32, 33, 35, 38, 40, 41, 54

teacher is 23 years.

3.3 Mone

As we have said Mean is not the only measure of central tendency or the only form of
representative value. For different requirements from a data, other measures of central
tendencies are used.

Look at the following example

To find out the weekly demand for different sizes of shirt, a shopkeeper kept records of sales
of sizes 90 cm, 95 cm, 100 cm, 105 cm, 110 cm. Following is the record for a week:

If he found the mean number of shirts sold, do you think that he would be able to
decide which shirt sizes to keep in stock?

M F total sh; id Total number of shirts sold 105 | 1
ean of total shirts sold = Number of different sizes of shirts 5

Should he obtain 21 shirts of each size? If he does so, will he be able to cater to the
needs of the customers?

2024-25

DATA HANDLING iii

The shopkeeper, on looking at the record, decides to procure shirts of sizes 95 cm,
100 cm, 105 cm. He decided to postpone the procurement of the shirts of other sizes
because of their small number of buyers.

Look at another example

The owner of a readymade dress shop says, The most popular size of
dress I sell is the size 90 cm.

Observe that here also, the owner is concerned about the number of
shirts of different sizes sold. She is however looking at the shirt size that is
sold the most. This is another representative value for the data. The highest
occuring event is the sale of size 90 cm. This representative value is called
the mode of the data.

The mode of a set of observations is the observation that occurs most often.

EXAMPLE 4 Find the mode of the given set of numbers: 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 2, 1,2, 2,4

SOLUTION Arranging the numbers with same values together, we get
1,1, 1, 2,2, 2,2, 3,4,4
Mode of this data is 2 because it occurs more frequently than other observations.

3.3.1 Mode of Large Data

Putting the same observations together and counting them is not easy if the number of
observations is large. In such cases we tabulate the data. Tabulation can begin by putting
tally marks and finding the frequency, as you did in your previous class.

Look at the following example:

EXAmMPLe 5 Following are the margins of victory in the football

2024-25

EE st emarics

Looking at the table, we can quickly say that 2 is the mode since 2 has occured the
highest number of times. Thus, most of the matches have been won with a victory margin
of 2 goals.

TuHink, Discuss AND WRITE

Can a set of numbers have more than one mode?

EXAMPLE 6Find the mode of the numbers: 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5,5, 5, 6, 6, 8

SOLUTION Here, 2 and 5 both occur three times. Therefore, they both are modes of
the data.

1. Record the age in years of all your classmates. Tabulate the data and find the mode.
2. Record the heights in centimetres of your classmates and find the mode.

1. Find the mode of the following data:
12, 14, 12, 16, 15, 13, 14, 18, 19, 12, 14, 15, 16, 15, 16, 16, 15,
17, 13, 16, 16, 15, 15, 13, 15, 17, 15, 14, 15, 13, 15, 14
2. Heights (in cm) of 25 children are given below:
168, 165, 163, 160, 163, 161, 162, 164, 163, 162, 164, 163, 160, 163, 160,
165, 163, 162, 163, 164, 163, 160, 165, 163, 162
What is the mode of their heights? What do we understand by mode here?

Whereas mean gives us the average of all observations of the data, the mode gives that
observation which occurs most frequently in the data.

Let us consider the following examples:

(a) You have to decide upon the number of chapattis needed for 25 people called for a
feast.

(b) Ashopkeeper selling shirts has decided to replenish her stock.
(c) Weneed to find the height of the door needed in our house.

(d) When going ona picnic, if only one fruit can be bought for everyone, which is the
fruit that we would get.

In which of these situations can we use the mode as a good estimate?

Consider the first statement. Suppose the number of chapattis needed by each person
is 2,3,2,3,2,1,2,3,2,2,4, 2, 2,3, 2,4, 4, 2,3, 2,4, 2,4, 3,5

2024-25

DATA HANDLING iy

The mode of the data is 2 chapattis. If we use mode as the representative value for this
data, then we need 50 chapattis only, 2 for each of the 25 persons. However the total
number would clearly be inadequate. Would mean be an appropriate representative value?

For the third statement the height of the door is related to the height
of the persons using that door. Suppose there are 5 children and 4
adults using the door and the height of each of 5 children is around 135
cm. The mode for the heights is 135 cm. Should we get a door thatis 
144 cm high? Would all the adults be able to go through that door? It is
clear that mode is not the appropriate representative value for this data.
Would mean be an appropriate representative value here?

Why not? Which representative value of height should be used to
decide the doorheight?

Similarly analyse the rest of the statements and find the representative
value useful for that issue.

Try THESE

Discuss with your friends and give

(a) Two situations where mean would be an appropriate representative value
to use, and

(b) Two situations where mode would be an appropriate representative value
to use.

3.4 MEDIAN

We have seen that in some situations, arithmetic mean is an appropriate measure of central
tendency whereas in some other situations, mode is the appropriate measure of central
tendency.

Let us now look at another example. Consider a group of 17 students with the following
heights (in cm): 106, 110, 123, 125, 117, 120, 112, 115, 110, 120, 115, 102, 115, 115,
109, 115, 101.

The games teacher wants to divide the class into two groups so that each group has
equal number of students, one group has students with height lesser than a particular height
and the other group has students with heights greater than the particular height. How
would she do that?

Let us see the various options she has:

(i) She can find the mean. The mean is

106+110+123+1254+1174+1204+112+115+110+120+1154+1024+115+115+109+115+101
 1930 113.5
2024-25

EE ee sr emarics

So, if the teacher divides the students into two groups on the basis of this mean height,
such that one group has students of height less than the mean height and the other group
has students with height more than the mean height, then the groups would be of unequal
size. They would have 7 and 10 members respectively.

(ii) The second option for her is to find mode. The observation with highest frequency is
115 cm, which would be taken as mode.

There are 7 children below the mode and 10 children at the mode and above the
mode. Therefore, we cannot divide the group into equal parts.

Let us therefore think of an alternative representative value or measure of central
tendency. For doing this we again look at the given heights (in cm) of students and arrange
them in ascending order. We have the following observations:

101, 102, 106, 109, 110, 110, 112, 115, 115, 115, 115, 115, 117, 120, 120, 123, 125

The middle value in this data is 115 because this value

Try THESE divides the students into two equal groups of 8 students each.
This value is called as Median. Median refers to the value

Your friend found the median and the
mode of a given data. Describe and
correct your friends error if any:

which lies in the middle of the data (when arranged in an
increasing or decreasing order) with half of the observations
above it and the other half below it. The games teacher decides

35, 32, 35, 42, 38, 32, 34 to keep the middle student as a refree in the game.
Median = 42, Mode = 32 Here, we consider only those cases where number of
observations is odd.

Thus, in a given data, arranged in ascending or descending order, the median gives us
the middle observation.
Note that in general, we may not get the same value for median and mode.

Thus we realise that mean, mode and median are the numbers that are the representative
values of a group of observations or data. They lie between the minimum and maximum
values of the data. They are also called the measures of the central tendency.

EXAMPLE 7 Find the median of the data: 24, 36, 46, 17, 18, 25, 35

SOLUTION Wearrange the data in ascending order, we get 17, 18, 24, 25, 35, 36, 46
Median is the middle observation. Therefore 25 is the median.

(iv) The data 6, 4, 3, 8,9, 12, 13, 9 has mean 9.

3.5 Use oF Bar GRAPHS WITH A DIFFERENT PURPOSE

We have seen last year how information collected could be first arranged in a frequency
distribution table and then this information could be put as a visual representation in the
form of pictographs or bar graphs. You can look at the bar graphs and make deductions
about the data. You can also get information based on these bar graphs. For example, you
can say that the mode is the longest bar if the bar represents the frequency.

3.5.1 Choosing a Scale

We know that a bar graph is a representation of numbers using bars of uniform width and
the lengths of the bars depend upon the frequency and the scale you have chosen. For
example, in a bar graph where numbers in units are to be shown, the graph represents one
unit length for one observation and if it has to show numbers in tens or hundreds, one unit
length can represent 10 or 100 observations. Consider the following examples:

EXAMPLE 8Two hundred students of 6" and 7" classes were asked to name their
favourite colour so as to decide upon what should be the colour of their
school building. The results are shown in the following table. Represent
the given data on a bar graph.
Answer the following questions with the help of the bar graph:
(i) Which is the most preferred colour and which is the least preferred?

(it) How many colours are there in all? What are they?

SOLUTION Choose asuitable scale as follows:

Start the scale at 0. The greatest value in the data is 55, so end the scale at a value greater
than 55, such as 60. Use equal divisions along the axes, such as increments of 10. You

know that all the bars would lie between 0
and 60. We choose the scale such that the
length between 0 and 60 is neither too long
nor too small. Here we take | unit for 10
students.
We then draw and label the graph as shown.
From the bar graph we conclude that
(i) Blue is the most preferred colour
(Because the bar representing Blue is the
tallest).
(ii) Green is the least preferred colour.
(Because the bar representing Green is
the shortest).

(ii) There are five colours. They are Red, Green, Blue, Yellow and Orange. (These are
observed on the horizontal line)
