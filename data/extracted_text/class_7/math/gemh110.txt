10.1 INTRODUCTION

We have already come across simple algebraic expressions like x + 3, y 5, 4x +5,
10y 5 and so on. In Class VI, we have seen how these expressions are useful in formulating puzzles and problems. We have also seen examples of several expressions in the
chapter on simple equations.

Expressions are a central concept in algebra. This Chapter is devoted to algebraic
expressions. When you have studied this Chapter, you will know how algebraic
expressions are formed, how they can be combined, how we can find their values and
how they can be used.

10.2 How are ExXprREssIons FORMED?

We now know very well what a variable is. We use letters x, y, /, m, ... etc. to denote
variables. A variable can take various values. Its value is not fixed. On the other hand, a
constant has a fixed value. Examples of constants are: 4, 100, 17, etc.

We combine variables and constants to make algebraic expressions. For this, we use
the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. We have already come
across expressions like 4x + 5, 10y 20. The expression 4x + 5 is obtained from the
variable x, first by multiplying x by the constant 4 and then adding the constant 5 to the
product. Similarly, 10y 20 is obtained by first multiplying y by 10 and then subtracting 20
from the product.

The above expressions were obtained by combining variables with constants. We can
also obtain expressions by combining variables with themselves or with other variables.

Look at how the following expressions are obtained:
x , 2y , 3x? 5, xy, 4xy +7
(i) The expression x is obtained by multiplying the variable x by itself;
XXX=X?
Just as 4 x 4 is written as 4 , we write x x x =x . Itis commonly read as x squared.

(Later, when you study the chapter Exponents and Powers you will realise that x 
may also be read as x raised to the power 2).

In the same manner, we can write XXxXxXx=%x3
Commonly, x? is read as x cubed . Later, you will realise that x may also be read
as x raised to the power 3.

x, x , x , ... are all algebraic expressions obtained from x.
The expression 2y7is obtained fromy: 2y?=2xyxy
Here by multiplying y with y we obtain y? and then we multiply y by the constant 2.
In (3x? 5) we first obtain x , and multiply it by 3 to get 3x .
From 3x , we subtract 5 to finally arrive at 3x? 5.

Describe how the
following expressions
are obtained:

In xy, we multiply the variable x with another variable y. Thus,
XxX y=xy.
In 4xy + 7, we first obtain xy, multiply it by 4 to get 4xy and

10.3 TERMS OF AN EXPRESSION

We shall now put in a systematic form what we have learnt above about how expressions
are formed. For this purpose, we need to understand what terms of an expression and
their factors are.

Consider the expression (4x + 5). In forming this expression, we first formed 4x

separately as a product of 4 and x and then added 5 to it. Similarly consider the expression

(3x?

+ Jy). Here we first formed 3x separately as a product of 3, x and x. We then

formed 7y separately as a product of 7 and y. Having formed 3x and 7y separately, we
added them to get the expression.

You will find that the expressions we deal with can always be seen this way. They

have parts which are formed separately and then added. Such parts of an expression
which are formed separately first and then added are known as terms. Look at the
expression (4x* 3xy). We say that it has two terms, 4x? and 3xy. The term 4x is a
product of 4, x and x, and the term ( 3xy) is a product of ( 3), x and y.

Terms are added to form expressions. Just as the terms 4x and 5 are added to

form the expression (4x + 5), the terms 4.x* and ( 3xy) are added to give the expression
(4x 3xy). This is because 4x? + ( 3xy) = 4x? 3xy.

Note, the minus sign ( ) is included in the term. In the expression 4x 3xy, we

took the term as ( 3xy) and not as (3xy). That is why we do not need to say that

terms are added or subtracted to form an expression; just added is enough.

Factors of a term

We

saw above that the expression (4x? 3xy) consists of two terms 4x and 3xy. The

term 4x is a product of 4, x and x; we say that 4, x and x are the factors of the term 4x .
Aterm is a product of its factors. The term 3xy is a product of the factors 3, x and y.

We can represent the terms and factors of
the terms of an expression conveniently and
elegantly by a tree diagram. The tree for the
expression (4x? 3xy) is as shown in the
adjacent figure.

Note, in the tree diagram, we have used

dotted lines for factors and continuous lines for
terms. This is to avoid mixing them.

Let us draw a tree diagram for the expression
Sxy + 10.

The factors are such that they cannot be
further factorised. Thus we do not write 5xy as
5 x xy, because xy can be further factorised.
Similarly, if x* were a term, it would be written as
xxx xx and not x? x x. Also, remember that
1 is not taken as a separate factor.

Coefficients

When the coefficient of a term is +1, itis usually omitted.

For example, |x is written as x; 1 x y is written as x y* and
so on. Also, the coefficient ( 1) is indicated only by the minus sign. Thus ( 1) x is
written as x; ( 1) x? y is written as x y and so on.

Sometimes, the word coefficient is used in a more general way. Thus

coefficient of 10 y? and y is the coefficient of 10x. Thus, in this more general
way, a coefficient may be either a numerical factor or an algebraic factor or
a product of two or more factors. It is said to be the coefficient of the

4x 3y,a+b+5,2y+5,2xy product of the remaining factors.

10.4 Like AND UNLIKE TERMS

When terms have the same algebraic factors, they are like terms. When terms have different
algebraic factors, they are unlike terms. For example, in the expression 2xy 3x + Sxy 4,
look at the terms 2xy and 5xy. The factors of 2xy are 2, x and y. The factors of 5xy are 5,

xand y. Thus their algebraic (i.e., those which contain variables) factors are the same and

BYE HESE terms 2xy and 3x, have different algebraic factors.

following: and 4, are unlike terms. Also, the terms 3x and 4

10.5 MonomIALs, BINOMIALS, TRINOMIALS AND
POLYNOMIALS

An expression with only one term is called a monomial; for example, 7xy, 5m,
327, 4 etc.

An expression which contains two unlike terms 1s called a

binomial; for example, x + y,m - 5, mn + 4m, a - b* are

binomials. The expression 10pq is not a binomial; it is a

7,4m 7n + 10, 4mn +7.

An expression which contains three terms is called a
trinomial; for example, the expressions x + y+ 7, ab+a+tb,
3x 5x + 2, m+n + 10 are trinomials. The expression
ab+a+b+5is, however not a trinomial; it contains four
terms and not three. The expression x+ y+ 5x1is nota trinomial
as the terms x and 5x are like terms.

In general, an expression with one or more terms is called a polynomial. Thus a
monomial, a binomial and a trinomial are all polynomials.

Following simple steps will help you to decide whether the given terms are like
or unlike terms:
(i) Ignore the numerical coefficients. Concentrate on the algebraic part of the
terms.
(ii) Check the variables in the terms. They must be the same.
(iii) Next, check the powers of each variable in the terms. They must be the same.
Note that in deciding like terms, two things do not matter (1) the numerical
coefficients of the terms and (2) the order in which the variables are multiplied in the
terms.

10.6 FINDING THE VALUE OF AN EXPRESSION

We know that the value of an algebraic expression depends on the values of the variables
forming the expression. There are a number of situations in which we need to find the value
of an expression, such as when we wish to check whether a particular value of a variable
satisfies a given equation or not.

We find values of expressions, also, when we use formulas from geometry and from

everyday mathematics. For example, the area of a square is / , where / is the length of a
side of the square. If /= 5 cm., the area is 57cm? or 25 cm ; if the side is 10 cm, the area
is 10?cm? or 100 cm? and so on. We shall see more such examples in the next section.

(i) In5n? + 5n 2, we have,

and 5n? =5 x (- 2, =5x4=20 [as (- 2)?= 4]
Combining,

(ii) Now, forn =- 2,
5n?+5n 2=8 and
n? = (-2) = (-2) x (-2) x (-2) =-8
Combining,
n+ 5n?+5n-2=-84+8=0

We shall now consider expressions of two variables, for example, x + y, xy. To work

out the numerical value of an expression of two variables, we need to give the values of
both variables. For example, the value of (x + y), forx=3 and y=5,is3+5=8.

WHAT HAVE WE DISCUSSED?

Algebraic expressions are formed from variables and constants. We use the
operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on the variables
and constants to form expressions. For example, the expression 4xy + 7 is formed
from the variables x and y and constants 4 and 7. The constant 4 and the variables
x and y are multiplied to give the product 4xy and the constant 7 is added to this
product to give the expression.

Expressions are made up of terms. Terms are added to make an expression. For
example, the addition of the terms 4.xy and 7 gives the expression 4xy + 7.

A term is a product of factors. The term 4xy in the expression 4.xy + 7 is a product
of factors x, y and 4. Factors containing variables are said to be algebraic factors.

The coefficient is the numerical factor in the term. Sometimes anyone factor ina
term is called the coefficient of the remaining part of the term.

Any expression with one or more terms is called a polynomial. Specifically a one
term expression is called a monomial; a two-term expression is called a binomial;
and a three-term expression is called a trinomial.

Terms which have the same algebraic factors are like terms. Terms
which have different algebraic factors are unlike terms. Thus,
terms 4xy and 3xy are like terms; but terms 4.xy and 3x are
not like terms.

In situations such as solving an equation and using a formula, we
have to find the value of an expression. The value of the
expression depends on the value of the variable from which the
expression is formed. Thus, the value of 7x 3 for x =5 is 32,
since 7(5) 3 = 35 3 = 32.
