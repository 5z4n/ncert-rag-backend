QUANTITIES

Anita s Report i, pp Rita s Report

Total 320/400 LA DX Total 300/360
Percentage: 80 |4 Percentage: 83.3

Anita said that she has done better as she got 320 marks whereas Rita got only 300. Do
you agree with her? Who do you think has done better?

Mansi told them that they cannot decide who has done better by just comparing the
total marks obtained because the maximum marks out of which they got the marks are not
the same.

She said why don t you see the Percentages given in your report cards?
Anita s Percentage was 80 and Rita s was 83.3. So, this shows Rita has done better.
Do you agree?

Percentages are numerators of fractions with denominator 100 and have been
used in comparing results. Let us try to understand in detail about it.

7.1.1) Meaning of Percentage

Per cent is derived from Latin word per centum meaning per hundred |

Per cent is represented by the symbol % and means hundredths too. That is 1% means

1 out of hundred or one hundredth. It can be written as: 1% = 100 =0.01

To understand this, let us consider the following example.

Size 5:14 Size 6:8

Write this information in tabular form as done earlier and
find the Percentage of each shoe size available in the shop.

Percentages when total is not hundred

In all these examples, the total number of items add up to 100. For example, Rina had 100
tiles in all, there were 100 children and 100 shoe pairs. How do we calculate Percentage
of an item if the total number of items do not add up to 100? In such cases, we need to
convert the fraction to an equivalent fraction with denominator 100. Consider the following
example. You have a necklace with twenty beads in two colours.

Anwar found the Percentage of red beads like this Asha does it like this
Out of 20 beads, the number of red beads is 8. 8 8x5

Hence, out of 100, the number of red beads is 20 20x5

= = 40%

8 100 = 40 (out of hundred) = 40% 40
20 100

We see that these three methods can be used to find the Percentage when the total
does not add to give 100. In the method shown in the table, we multiply the fraction by
100 00 
denominator.

. This does not change the value of the fraction. Subsequently, only 100 remains in the
Anwar has used the unitary method. Asha has multiplied by 5 to get 100 in the
denominator. You can use whichever method you find suitable. May be, you can make
your own method too.

The method used by Anwar can work for all ratios. Can the method used by Asha also
work for all ratios? Anwar says Asha s method can be used only if you can find a natural
number which on multiplication with the denominator gives 100. Since denominator was 20,
she could multiply it by 5 to get 100. If the denominator was 6, she would not have been
able to use this method. Do you agree?

7.1.2 Converting Fractional. Numbers to Percentage
Fractional numbers can have different denominator. To compare fractional numbers, we
need a common denominator and we have seen that it is more convenient to compare if
our denominator is 100. That is, we are converting the fractions to Percentages. Let us try
converting different fractional numbers to Percentages.

7.1.3 Converting Decimals to Percentage

We have seen how fractions can be converted to per cents. Let us now find how decimals
can be converted to per cents.

EXAMPLE 4 Convert the given decimals to per cents:

(a) 0.75 (b) 0.09 (c) 0.2
SOLUTION
(a) 0.75 = 0.75 x 100 % (b) 0.09 = ~ =9 %

(iv) There are 120 voters, 90 of them voted yes. What per cent voted yes?

7.1.4 Converting Percentages to Fractions or Decimals

We have so far converted fractions and decimals to percentages. We can also do the
reverse. That is, given per cents, we can convert them to decimals or fractions. Look at the
table, observe and complete it:

Parts always add to give a whole

In the examples for coloured tiles, for the heights of children and for gases XK Wa

in the air, we find that when we add the Percentages we get 100. All the =
parts that form the whole when added together gives the whole or 100%. Z| Ww
So, if we are given one part, we can always find out the other part. Suppose,

30% of a given number of students are boys.

This means that if there were 100 students, 30 out of them would be boys and the
remaining would be girls.

Then girls would obviously be (100 30)% = 70%.

7.2 USE oF PERCENTAGES

7.2.1 Interpreting Percentages
We saw how percentages were helpful in comparison. We have also learnt to convert
fractional numbers and decimals to percentages. Now, we shall learn how percentages
can be used in real life. For this, we start with interpreting the following statements:
 5% of the income is saved by Ravi. 20 % of Meera s dresses are blue in colour.
 Rekha gets 10% on every book sold by her.

What can you infer from each of these statements?
By 5 % we mean 5 parts out of 100 or we write it as 700: It means Ravi is saving

=5 out of every = 100 that he earns. In the same way, interpret the rest of the statements
given above.

7.2.2 Converting Percentages to How Many 
Consider the following examples:

EXAMPLE 6 A survey of 40 children showed that 25% liked playing football. How
many children liked playing football?

SOLUTION Here, the total number of children are 40. Out of these, 25% like playing
football. Meena and Arun used the following methods to find the number.

EXAMPLE 7 Rahul bought a sweater and saved % 200 when a discount of 25% was
given. What was the price of the sweater before the discount?

SOLUTION _ Rahulhas saved? 200 when price of sweater is reduced by 25%. This
means that 25% reduction in price is the amount saved by Rahul. Let us
see how Mohan and Abdul have found the original cost of the sweater.

7.2.3 Ratios to Percents

Sometimes, parts are given to us in the form of ratios and we need to convert those to
percentages. Consider the following example:

EXAMPLE 8 Reena s mother said, to make idlis, you must take two parts rice and
one part urad dal. What percentage of such a mixture would be rice
and what percentage would be urad dal?

SOLUTION In terms of ratio we would write this as Rice : Urad dal=2: 1.

2 1
Now, 2 + 1=3 is the total of all parts. This means 3 part is rice and 3 part is urad dal.

Then, percentage of rice would be : x100%= = = 665 %.

Percentage of urad dal would be 5 * 100 % = ae 33 3 % .

7.2.4 Increase or Decrease as Per Cent

There are times when we need to know the increase or decrease in a certain quantity as
percentage. For example, if the population of a state increased from 5,50,000 to
6,05,000. Then the increase in population can be understood better if we say, the
population increased by 10 %.

How do we convert the increase or decrease in a quantity as a percentage of the initial
amount? Consider the following example.
EXAMPLE 10Aschool team won 6 games this year against 4 games won last year.
What is the per cent increase?

7.3 PRICES RELATED TO AN ITEM oR BUYING (AND SELLING
I bought it for = 600 SHOP

Lae)
@: and will sell it for 610

The buying price of any item is known as its cost price. It is written in short as CP.
The price at which you sell is known as the selling price or in short SP.

What would you say is better, to you sell the item at a lower price, same price or higher
price than your buying price? You can decide whether the sale was profitable or not
depending on the CP and SP. If CP< SP then you made a profit = SP CP.

If CP=SP then you are in ano profit no loss situation.
If CP> SP then you have a loss = CP SP.
Let us try to interpret the statements related to prices of items.
@ Atoy bought for = 72 is sold at = 80.
@ A T-shirt bought for? 120 is sold at 100.
@ Acycle bought for % 800 is sold for = 940.
Let us consider the first statement.

The buying price (or CP) is 72 and the selling price (or SP) is 80. This means SP
is more than CP. Hence profit made = SP CP =% 80- %72=%8

Now try interpreting the remaining statements in a similar way.

7.3.1 Profit or Loss as a Percentage
The profit or loss can be converted to a percentage. It is always calculated on the CP.
For the above examples, we can find the profit % or loss %.

Let us consider the example related to the toy. We have CP = 72, SP = = 80,
Profit = = 8. To find the percentage of profit, Neha and Shekhar have used the
following methods.

2024-25

COMPARING QUANTITIES iii hE is

Neha does it this way

Shekhar does it this way

Profit 8
x 100 = = x100

Profit per cent = CP 79

On 72 the profit is 8
On 100, profit = 7 x100

7 1
Thus, the profit is 8 and } _ i Thus, profit per cent = lls

profit Per cent is 1 re .

Similarly you can find the loss per cent in the second situation. Here,
CP =% 120, SP == 100.
> Therefore, Loss = % 120 % 100 = 20

Lees veneers On Z 120, the loss is 20
p - So on = 100, the loss
= 20 5. 100 2 20 1

120 120

50 2 2
=> 165 Thus, loss per cent is 16 >

Try the last case.

Now we see that given any two out of the three quantities related to prices that is, CP,
SP, amount of Profit or Loss or their percentage, we can find the rest.

EXAMPLE 12 The cost of a flower vase is 120. If the shopkeeper sells it at a loss
of 10%, find the price at which it is sold.

SOLUTION Weare given that CP=% 120 and Loss per cent = 10. We have to find

the SP.

Sohan does it like this Anandi does it like this
Loss of 10% means if CP is = 100, Loss is 10% of the cost price
Loss is 10 = 10% of = 120
Therefore, SP would be = 100 =%12
= (100 10) == 90 Therefore
When CP is = 100, SP is = 90. SP = CP - Loss
Therefore, if CP were = 120 then = % 120 -= 12 == 108
SP = Eo x120 == 108 Thus, by both methods we get the SP as

100 = 108.

2024-25

MATHEMATICS

EXAMPLE 13 Selling price of a toy car is % 540. If the profit made by shopkeeper is
20%, what is the cost price of this toy?

i SOLUTION Weare given that SP=% 540 and the Profit = 20%. We need to find the CP.

Amina does it like this Arun does it like this
20% profit will mean if CP is = 100, Profit = 20% of CP and SP=CP + Profit
profit is = 20 So, 540 = CP + 20% of CP
Therefore, SP = 100 + 20 = 120 20 | fe

Now, when SP is = 120, =CP+ 59 xCP= Hr

then CP is = 100.

Therefore, when SP is = 540, _6 CP. Therefore, 540x SA cp
2 6
then CP = X50 == 450 or = 450 = CP

Thus, by both methods, the cost price is 450.

7.4 CHARGE GIVEN.ON BORROWED MONEY oR SIMPLE
INTEREST

Sohini said that they were going to buy a new scooter. Mohan asked her
whether they had the money to buy it. Sohini said her father was going to
take a loan from a bank. The money you borrow is known as sum borrowed
or principal.

This money would be used by the borrower for some time before it is
returned. For keeping this money for some time the borrower has to pay some
extra money to the bank. This is known as Interest.

You can find the amount you have to pay at the end of the year by adding
the sum borrowed and the interest. That is, Amount = Principal + Interest.

Interest is generally given in per cent for a period of one year. It is written
as say 10% per year or per annum or in short as 10% p.a. (per annum).

10% p.a. means on every & 100 borrowed, = 10 is the interest you have to pay for one
year. Let us take an example and see how this works.

EXAMPLE 14 Anita takes a loan of = 5,000 at 15% per year as rate of interest. Find
the interest she has to pay at the end of one year.

2024-25

COMPARING QUANTITIES iii is

SOLUTION The sum borrowed = 5,000, Rate of interest = 15% per year.
This means if = 100 is borrowed, she has to pay 15 as interest for one year. If she has
borrowed % 5,000, then the interest she has to pay for one year
=z 100 x5000 =% 750
So, at the end of the year she has to give an amount of = 5,000 + = 750 = %5,750.
We can write a general relation to find interest for one year. Take P as the principal or
sum and R % as Rate per cent per annum.
Now on every & 100 borrowed, the interest paid is = R
RxP PXR

100 ~ 100 

Therefore, on % P borrowed, the interest paid for one year would be

7.4.1 Interest for Multiple Years

If the amount is borrowed for more than one year the interest is calculated for the period
the money is kept for. For example, if Anita returns the money at the end of two years and
the rate of interest is the same then she would have to pay twice the interest i.e., 750 for
the first year and = 750 for the second. This way of calculating interest where principal is
not changed is known as simple interest. As the number of years increase the interest
also increases. For = 100 borrowed for 3 years at 18%, the interest to be paid at the end
of 3 years is 18+ 18+ 18=3 x 18 =% 54.

We can find the general form for simple interest for more than one year.
We know that on a principal of = P at R% rate of interest per year, the interest paid for

one year is . Therefore, interest / paid for T years would be

COMPARING QUANTITIES iii Er

Amina buys a book for 275 and sells it at a loss of 15%. How much does she sell
it for?

Find the amount to be paid at the end of 3 years in each case:

(a) Principal =% 1,200 at 12% p.a. (b) Principal =% 7,500 at 5% p.a.

What rate gives = 280 as interest on a sum of 56,000 in 2 years?

If Meena gives an interest of = 45 for one year at 9% rate p.a.. What is the sum she
has borrowed?

Wat HAVE WE DiscussEeD?
A way of comparing quantities is percentage. Percentages are numerators of fractions
with denominator 100. Per cent means per hundred.
For example 82% marks means 82 marks out of hundred.
Fractions can be converted to percentages and vice-versa.
75 3
100 4
Decimals too can be converted to percentages and vice-versa.
For example, 0.25 = 0.25 x 100% = = 25%
Percentages are widely used in our daily life,

For example, . = = x100% whereas, 75% =

(a) We have learnt to find exact number when a certain per cent of the total quantity
is given.

(b) When parts of a quantity are given to us as ratios, we have seen how to convert
them to percentages.

(c) The increase or decrease in a certain quantity can also be expressed as percentage.

(d) The profit or loss incurred in a certain transaction can be expressed in terms of
percentages.

(e) While computing interest on an amount borrowed, the rate of interest is given in
terms of per cents. For example, = 800 borrowed for 3 years at 12% per annum.
