Numbers

Chapter 8

8.1 INTRODUCTION

You began your study of numbers by counting objects around you. The
numbers used for this purpose were called counting numbers or natural
numbers. They are 1, 2, 3, 4, ... By including 0 to natural numbers, we
got the whole numbers, i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, ... The negatives of natural
numbers were then put together with whole numbers to make up
integers. Integers are ..., 3, 2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, .... We, thus, extended
the number system, from natural numbers to whole numbers and from
whole numbers to integers.

. . numerator
You were also introduced to fractions. These are numbers of the form umerato

denominator |
where the numerator 1s either 0 or a positive integer and the denominator, a positive integer.
You compared two fractions, found their equivalent forms and studied all the four basic
operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on them.

In this Chapter, we shall extend the number system further. We shall introduce the concept
of rational numbers alongwith their addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations.

8.2 NEED FOR RATIONAL NUMBERS

Earlier, we have seen how integers could be used to denote opposite situations involving
numbers. For example, if the distance of 3 km to the right of a place was denoted by 3, then
the distance of 5 km to the left of the same place could be denoted by 5. If a profit of = 150
was represented by 150 then a loss of = 100 could be written as 100.

There are many situations similar to the above situations that involve fractional numbers.
You can represent a distance of 750m above sea level as 4 km. Can we represent 750m

3 -3
below sea level in km? Can we denote the distance of ~ km below sea level by 4 ? We can
3,
see 4 is neither an integer, nor a fractional number. We need to extend our number system
to include such numbers.

8.3 WHat ARE RaTIONAL NuMBERS?
The word rational arises from the term ratio . You know that a ratio like 3:2 can also be
written as : . Here, 3 and 2 are natural numbers.

Similarly, the ratio of two integers p and q (q #0), 1.e., p:g can be written in the form

P This is the form in which rational numbers are expressed.
A rational number is defined as a number that can be expressed in the

form 5 where p and q are integers and q # 0.

A
Thus, 5 is arational number. Here, p=4 and g=5S.

Is 4 also a rational number? Yes, because p = 3 and q =4 are integers.

3 4.2
@ You have seen many fractions like 878 1 3 etc. All fractions are rational
numbers. Can you say why?
How about the decimal numbers like 0.5, 2.3, etc.? Each of such numbers can be
written as an ordinary fraction and, hence, are rational numbers. For example, 0.5 = 10 ;

0.333 333
333 = O99 etc.

Thus, in 7 the numerator is 3 and the denominator is 7.

Mention five rational numbers each of whose
(a) Numerator is a negative integer and denominator is a positive integer.
(b) Numerator is a positive integer and denominator is a negative integer.
(c) Numerator and denominator both are negative integers.
(d) Numerator and denominator both are positive integers.
@ Ate integers also rational numbers?
Any integer can be thought of as a rational number. For example, the integer 5 is a

rational number, because you can write it as n . The integer 0 can also be written as
0= 3 or 7 etc. Hence, it is also a rational number.

Thus, rational numbers include integers and fractions.

Equivalent rational numbers

A rational number can be written with different numerators and denominators. For example,

consider the rational number .
ah -2 2x2 -4 2 _4

. We see that is the same as .

3 3x2 6 3 6

Thus, 3 = 6 TOS" Such rational numbers that are equal to each other are said to
be equivalent to each other.

By multiplying the numerator and denominator of a rational
number by the same non zero integer, we obtain another rational
number equivalent to the given rational number. This is exactly like
Fill in the boxes: obtaining equivalent fractions.
Just as multiplication, the division of the numerator and denominator

8.5 RationaL NuMBERS ON A NuMBER LINE

You know how to represent integers on a number line. Let us draw one such number line.

 4 3 2 l 0 1 2 3 4
The points to the right of 0 are denoted by + sign and are positive integers. The points
to the left of 0 are denoted by sign and are negative integers.
Representation of fractions on a number line is also known to you.
Let us see how the rational numbers can be represented on a number line.
Let us represent the number 5 on the number line.

As done in the case of positive integers, the positive rational numbers would be marked
on the right of 0 and the negative rational numbers would be marked on the left of 0.

To which side of 0 will you mark ; ? Being a negative rational number, it would be
marked to the left of 0.

You know that while marking integers on the number line, successive integers are
marked at equal intervels. Also, from 0, the pair 1 and 1 is equidistant. So are the pairs 2
and 2, 3 and 3.

In the same way, the rational numbers > and > would be at equal distance from 0.
We know how to mark the rational number = . It is marked at a point which is half the

O and -1.

and is at the same distance as = from 0.

The denominators of these rational numbers are positive integers and | is

the only common factor between the numerators and denominators. Further,

the negative sign occurs only in the numerator.

Such rational numbers are said to be in standard form.
2024-25

RATIONAL NUMBERS ie oe

A rational number is said to be in the standard form if its denominator is a
positive integer and the numerator and denominator have no common factor other
than 1,

If a rational number is not in the standard form, then it can be reduced to the
standard form.

Recall that for reducing fractions to their lowest forms, we divided the numerator and
the denominator of the fraction by the same non zero positive integer. We shall use the
same method for reducing rational numbers to their standard form.
EXAMPLE 1] Reduce 30 to the standard form.

45 -45+3 -15_ -15+5_ -3
30 3073 10 '10+5 
We had to divide twice. First time by 3 and then by 5. This could also be done as
45 -45+15_ -3
30 302152
In this example, note that 15 is the HCF of 45 and 30.

Thus, to reduce the rational number to its standard form, we divide its numerator
and denominator by their HCF ignoring the negative sign, if any. (The reason for
ignoring the negative sign will be studied in Higher Classes)

SOLUTION Wehave,

If there is negative sign in the denominator, divide by - HCP .

EXAMPLE 2 Reduce to standard form:

ay i) 15
SOLUTION

(i) The HCF of 36 and 24 is 12.
Thus, its standard form would be obtained by dividing by 12.
36 36+(-12) _ -3
24 -24+(-12) 2

(ii) The HCF of 3 and 15 is 3.

8.7 COMPARISON OF RATIONAL NUMBERS

We know how to compare two integers or two fractions and tell which is smaller or which
is greater among them. Let us now see how we can compare two rational numbers.

2 5
@ Two positive rational numbers, like = and 7 can be compared as studied earlier in the
case of fractions.
| 1 ,
@ Mary compared two negative rational numbers 5 and 5 using number line. She
knew that the integer which was on the right side of the other integer, was the greater
integer.

For example, 5 is to the right of 2 on the number line and 5 > 2. The integer 2 is on
the right of 5 on the number line and 2> 5.

She used this method for rational numbers also. She knew how to mark rational numbers

@ The case of pairs of negative rational numbers is similar. Jo compare two negative
rational numbers, we compare them ignoring their negative signs and then reverse

@ Comparison of a negative and a positive rational number is obvious. A negative rational
number is to the left of zero whereas a positive rational number is to the right of zero on

8.8 RationaL NuMBERS BETWEEN Two RatTionaL NUMBERS

Reshma wanted to count the whole numbers between 3 and 10. From her earlier classes,
she knew there would be exactly 6 whole numbers between 3 and 10. Similarly, she
wanted to know the total number of integers between 3 and 3. The integers between 3
and 3 are 2, 1, 0, 1, 2. Thus, there are exactly 5 integers between 3 and 3.

Are there any integers between 3 and 2? No, there is no integer between
 3 and 2. Between two successive integers the number of integers is 0.

2024-25

MATHEMATICS

Thus, we find that number of integers between two integers are limited (finite).

Will the same happen in the case of rational numbers also?

Reshma took two rational numbers = and =.
She converted them to rational numbers with same denominators.

rational numbers of the given rational numbers with this LCM as the denominator.
Then, add the two rational numbers.

9 7 9 -5 45 ~
She used the idea of reciprocal as done in fractions. f
it first divided b > d 28
Arpit first divide g by = an got 45 
He finally said 4.3.78 How didh hat?
e y sai 9 7 45: Howdi e get that?
He divided them as fractions, ignoring the negative sign and then put the negative sign
in the value so obtained.

 28 2 -5
Both of them got the same value 45 Try dividing 3 by 7 both ways and see if

you get the same answer.
This shows, to divide one rational number by the other non-zero rational number
we multiply the rational number by the reciprocal of the other.

1. A number that can be expressed in the form 7 , where p and q are integers and

; . 2 3 ;
q # 0, 1s called a rational number. The numbers 79? 3 etc. are rational numbers.

2. Allintegers and fractions are rational numbers.

3. Ifthe numerator and denominator of a rational number are multiplied or divided by a
non-zero integer, we get a rational number which is said to be equivalent to the given

rational number. For example 3 = 3x2 = 6 . SO, We Say 6 is the equivalent
7 7x2 14 14
 3 6 - 6+2 -3

4. Rational numbers are classified as Positive and Negative rational numbers. When the
numerator and denominator, both, are positive integers, itis a positive rational number.
When either the numerator or the denominator is a negative integer, it is anegative

rational number. For example, 8 is a positive rational number whereas > isa

negative rational number.
5. The number 0 is neither a positive nor a negative rational number.

6. A rational number is said to be in the standard form if its denominator is a positive
integer and the numerator and denominator have no common factor other than 1.

The numbers = : etc. are in standard form.

7. There are unlimited number of rational numbers between two rational numbers.

8. Two rational numbers with the same denominator can be added by adding their
numerators, keeping the denominator same. Two rational numbers with different
denominators are added by first taking the LCM of the two denominators and
then converting both the rational numbers to their equivalent forms having the

2 3-16 9 -16+9 -7

LCM as th i .F | += + = = . Here,
CM as the denominator. For example, ar Cy y 7A 7A ere

LCM of 3 and 8 is 24.

9. While subtracting two rational numbers, we add the additive inverse of the rational
number to be subtracted to the other rational number.
7 2_7 2 7, (-2)_21+(-16)_ 5

Thus, z 379 additive inverse of 373 3 74 7A"

10. To multiply two rational numbers, we multiply their numerators and denominators

product of numerators
product of denominators

separately, and write the product as

11. Todivide one rational number by the other non-zero rational number, we multiply the
rational number by the reciprocal of the other. Thus,
