9.1 AREA OF A PARALLELOGRAM

We come across many shapes other than squares and rectangles.
How will you find the area of a land which is a parallelogram in shape?
Let us find a method to get the area of a parallelogram.

Can a parallelogram be converted into a rectangle of equal area?

Draw a parallelogram on a graph paper as shown in Fig 9.1(4). Cut out the
parallelogram. Draw a line from one vertex of the parallelogram perpendicular to the
opposite side [Fig 9.1(11)]. Cut out the triangle. Move the triangle to the other side of the
parallelogram.

What shape do you get? You get a rectangle.
Is the area of the parallelogram equal to the area

of the rectangle formed? : Loh ~> breadth

What are the length and the breadth of the

rectangle?

PERIMETER AND AREA ii

We find that the length of the rectangle formed is equal to the base of the parallelogram
and the breadth of the rectangle is equal to the height of the parallelogram (Fig 9.2).
Now, Area of parallelogram = Area of rectangle

= length x breadth =/xb

But the length / and breadth b of the rectangle are exactly the
base b and the height h, respectively of the parallelogram.
Thus, the area of parallelogram = base x height = b xh.

Any side of a parallelogram can be chosen as base of the
parallelogram. The perpendicular dropped on that side from the opposite
vertex is known as height (altitude). In the parallelogram ABCD, DEis height ~~
Cc perpendicular to AB. Here AB is the A
base and DE is the height of the
parallelogram.

In this parallelogram ABCD, BF is the

perpendicular to opposite side AD. Here AD is the
base and BF is the height.

Consider the following parallelograms (Fig 9.2).

9.2 AREA OF A TRIANGLE

A gardener wants to know the cost of covering the whole of a triangular
garden with grass.

In this case we need to know the area of the triangular region.
Let us find a method to get the area of a triangle.

Draw a scalene triangle on a piece of paper. Cut out the triangle.
Place this triangle on another piece of paper and cut out another
triangle of the same size.

So now you have two scalene triangles of the same size.

Are both the triangles congruent?

Superpose one triangle on the other so that they match.
You may have to rotate one of the two triangles.

Now place both the triangles such that a pair of corresponding
sides is joined as shown in Fig 9.5.

Is the figure thus formed a parallelogram?
Compare the area of each triangle to the area of the
parallelogram.

Compare the base and height of the triangles with the base
and height of the parallelogram.

You will find that the sum of the areas of both the triangles is
equal to the area of the parallelogram. The base and the height
of the triangle are the same as the base and the height of the
parallelogram, respectively.
Area of each triangle = Oy (Area of parallelogram)
Oy (base X height) (Since area of a parallelogram = base X height)

by cutting along any of its diagonals. Are the triangles congruent?

In the figure (Fig 9.6) all the triangles are on the base

triangles corresponding to the base AB?

Can we say all the triangles are equal in area? Yes.

Are the triangles congruent also? No.

We conclude that all the congruent triangles
are equal in area but the triangles equal in area Fig 9.6

to decorate these cards. What length of the lace does she require for each? (Fig 9.19)

0 Oo 

(a)
Fig oe.

You cannot measure the curves with the help of a ruler, as these figures are not straight . Fig 9.20
What can you do?

Here is a way to find the length of lace required for shape in
Fig 9.19(a). Mark a point on the edge of the card and place the
card on the table. Mark the position of the point on the table also B
(Fig 9. 20).
Now roll the circular card on the table along a straight line till Fig 9.21

the marked point again touches the table. Measure the distance
along the line. This is the length of the lace required (Fig 9.21). It is also the distance along
the edge of the card from the marked point back to the marked point.

You can also find the distance by putting a string on the edge of the circular object and
taking all round it.

The distance around a circular region is known as its circumference.

Take a bottle cap, a bangle or any other circular object and find the circumference.

Now, can you find the distance covered by the athlete on the track by this method?

Still, it will be very difficult to find the distance around the track or any other circular .
object by measuring through string. Moreover, the measurement will not be accurate. LAL . d

So, we need some formula for this, as we have for rectilinear figures or shapes. 2a

Let us see if there is any relationship between the diameter and the circumference of
the circles.

Consider the following table: Draw six circles of different radii and find their circumference
by using string. Also find the ratio of the circumference to the diameter.

What do you infer from the above table? Is this ratio approximately the same? Yes.

Can you say that the circumference of a circle is always more than three times its
diameter? Yes.
This ratio is a constant and is denoted by 7 (pi). Its approximate value is = or 3.14.
So, we can say that d = 1 where C represents circumference of the circle and d 

its diameter.

or C=ud

We know that diameter (d) of a circle is twice the radius (7) 1.e., d= 2r

So, C=1d=n x 2r or C = 2mr.

EXAMPLE 7 Whatis the circumference of acircle of diameter 10 cm (Take t= 3.14)?

SOLUTION _ Diameter of the circle (d)= 10cm

Circumference of circle = 1d
=3.14x10cm=31.4cm
So, the circumference of the circle of diameter 10 cmis 31.4cm.

EXAMPLE 8 What is the circumference of a circular disc of radius 14 cm?
[Use t= 2)
SOLUTION _ Radius of circular disc (r) = 14cm
Circumference of disc = 27r

So, the circumference of the circular disc is 88 cm.

EXAMPLE 9 Theradius of acircular pipe is 10 cm. What length of a tape is required
to wrap once around the pipe (7 = 3.14)?
SOLUTION _ Radius of the pipe (r)=10cm
Length of tape required is equal to the circumference of the pipe.
Circumference of the pipe = 27r
=2x3.14x 10cm
= 62.8cm
Therefore, length of the tape needed to wrap once around the pipe is 62.8 cm.

EXAMPLE 10Find the perimeter of the given shape (Fig 9.23) (Take n= > ).

SOLUTION _Inthisshape we need to find the circumference of semicircles on each side
of the square. Do you need to find the perimeter of the square also? No.
The outer boundary, of this figure is made up of semicircles. Diameter of
each semicircle is 14 cm.

We know that:

Circumference of the circle = 1d
Circumference of the semicircle = > Td

= xX =
7 x 14cm =22 cm

Circumference of each of the semicircles is 22 cm

Therefore, perimeter of the given figure = 4 x 22cm =88cm Fig 9.23

EXAMPLE 11 Sudhanshu divides a circular disc of radius 7 cm in two equal parts.
What is the perimeter of each semicircular shape disc? (Use 1 = Fz)

SOLUTION To find the perimeter of the semicircular disc (Fig 9.24), we need to find
(i) Circumference of semicircular shape (ii) Diameter
Given that radius (r) = 7 cm. We know that the circumference of circle = 27r
a: the circumference of the semicircle 5 x2tr =r
= 7 x 7com=22 cm

Thus, perimeter of each semicircular disc = 22 cm + 14cm =36 cm
