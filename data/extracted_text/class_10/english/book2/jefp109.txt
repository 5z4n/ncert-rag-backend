Twentieth Century. She stands and bows to audience.

: Good afternoon. Welcome to our Museum of Ancient
History, and to my department curiosities of the
good old, far-off twentieth century. The twentieth
century was often called the Era of the Book. In those
days, there were books about everything, from ant
eaters to Zulus. Books taught people how to, and when
to, and where to, and why to. They illustrated,
educated, punctuated, and even decorated. But the

strangest thing a book ever did was to save the Earth.
You haven t heard about the Martian invasion of 2040?
Tsk, tsk. What do they teach children nowadays? Well,
you know, the invasion never really happened, because
a single book stopped it. What was the book, you ask?
A noble encyclopedia? A tome about rockets and
missiles? A secret file from outer space? No, it was
none of those. It was but here, let me turn on the
historiscope and show you what happened many
centuries ago, in 2040. (She turns on projector, and
points it left. Spotlight on Historian goes out, and comes
up down left on Think-Tank, who is seated on a raised
box, arms folded. He has a huge, egg-shaped head, and
he wears a long robe decorated with stars and circles.
Apprentice Noodle stands beside him at an elaborate
switchboard. A sign on an easel reads:

MARS SPACE CONTROL

GREAT AND MIGHTY THINK-TANK, COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF
(Bow low before entering)

: (bowing) O Great and Mighty Think-Tank, most

powerful and intelligent creature in the whole
universe, what are your orders?

: (peevishly) You left out part of my salutation,

Apprentice Noodle. Go over the whole thing again.

: It shall be done, sir. (in a singsong) O Great and Mighty

Think-Tank, Ruler of Mars and her two moons, most
powerful and intelligent creature in the whole
universe (out of breath) what-are-your-orders?

: That s better, Noodle. I wish to be placed in

communication with our manned space probe to that
ridiculous little planet we are going to put under our
generous rulership. What do they call it, again?

: Earth, your Intelligence.
: Earth of course. You see how insignificant the place

is? But first, something important. My mirror. I wish
to consult my mirror.

: (smacking mirror) Quicker. Answer quicker next time.
I hate a slow mirror. (He admires himself in the mirror.)
Ah, there I am. Are we Martians not a handsome
race? So much more attractive than those ugly
Earthlings with their tiny heads. Noodle, you keep on
exercising your mind, and someday you'll have a
balloon brain just like mine.

: Oh, I hope so, Mighty Think-Tank. I hope so.
: Now, contact the space probe. I want to invade that

primitive ball of mud called Earth before lunch.

READ AND FIND OUT
 What guesses are made by Think=Tank about the books
found on earth?
: A few seconds later
: Mars Space Control and the Centerville Public Library
: Captain Omega stands at centre, opening and closing card

catalogue drawers in a confused fashion. Lieutenant Iota
is up left, counting books in a bookcase. Sergeant Oop is at
right, opening and closing a book, turning it upside down,
shaking it and then riffling the pages and shaking his head.

: (adjusting knobs) I have a close sighting of the space

crew, Sirf.

(Think-Tank puts on a pair of enormous goggles and
turns towards the stage to watch.) They seem to have
entered some sort of Earth structure.

: Excellent. Make voice contact.

OMEGA : (speaking into a disk which is on a chain around her

Lieutenant Iota, Sergeant Oop, and I have arrived on
Earth without incident. We have taken shelter in this

idea where we are, Lieutenant Iota?

Iora : I can t figure it out, Captain. (holding up a book) I ve
counted two thousand of these peculiar items. This
place must be some sort of storage barn. What do you
think, Sergeant Oop?

Oop : I haven t a clue. I ve been to seven galaxies, but I ve
never seen anything like this. Maybe they re hats.
(He opens a book and puts it on his head.) Say, maybe
this is a haberdashery!

OMEGA : (bowing low) Perhaps the Great and Mighty ThinkTank will give us the benefit of his thought on
the matter.

: Elementary, my dear Omega. Hold one of the items

up so that I may view it closely. (Omega holds a book
on the palm of her hand.) Yes, yes, I understand now.
Since Earth creatures are always eating, the place
in which you find yourselves is undoubtedly a crude
refreshment stand.

: (to Iota and Oop) He says we're in a refreshment stand.
: Well, the Earthlings certainly have a strange diet.

: That item in your hand is called a sandwich.

: (nodding) A sandwich.

: (taking book from his head) A sandwich?

: Sandwiches are the main staple of Earth diet. Look

at it closely.(Omega squints at book.) There are two
slices of what is called bread, and between them is
some sort of filling.

: That is correct, sir.

: To confirm my opinion, I order you to eat it.
: (gulping) Eat it?

: Do you doubt the Mighty Think-Tank?

breakfast. Lieutenant Iota, I order you to eat this 
this sandwich.

: (dubiously) Eat it? Oh, Captain! It s a very great

honour to be the first Martian to eat a sandwich, I m
sure, but but how can I be so impolite as to eat
before my Sergeant? (handing Oop the book and saying
brightly) Sergeant Oop, I order you to eat the sandwich
immediately.

mouth wide. Omega and Iota watch him breathlessly.
He bites down ona corner of the book, and pantomimes
chewing and swallowing, while making terrible faces.)

the back.)

: Was it not delicious, Sergeant Oop?
: (saluting) That is correct, sir. It was not delicious. I

don t know how the Earthlings can get those
sandwiches down without water. They re dry as
Martian dust.

: Sir, sir. Great and Mighty Think-Tank. I beg your

pardon, but an insignificant bit of data floated into
my mind about those sandwiches.

: It can t be worth much, but go ahead. Give us your

trifling bit of data.

: Well, sir, I have seen surveyor films of those

sandwiches. I noticed that the Earthlings did not eat
them. They used them as some sort of communication
device.

: (haughtily) Naturally. That was my next point. These

are actually communication sandwiches. Think-Tank
is never wrong. Who is never wrong?

ears than we do.

make sounds.

has made a mistake?

: Please excuse me, your Brilliance, but a cloudy piece

of information is twirling around in my head.

: Well, twirl it out, Noodle, and I will clarify it for you.
: I'seem to recall that the Earthlings did not listen to

the sandwiches; they opened them and watched them.

: Yes, that is quite correct, I will clarify that for you,

Captain Omega. Those sandwiches are not for ear
communication, they are for eye communication. Now,
Captain Omega, take that large, colourful sandwich

over there. It appears to be important. Tell me what
you observe.

(Omega picks up a very large volume of Mother Goose,
holding it so that the audience can see the title. Iota

looks over her left shoulder, and Oop peers over her

realise the seriousness of this discovery? The
Earthlings have discovered how to combine
agriculture and mining. They can actually grow crops
of rare metals such as silver. And cockle shells. They
can grow high explosives, too. Noodle, contact our

THINK-TANK : Cease laughter. Desist. This is more and more
alarming. The Earthlings have reached a high level of
civilisation. Didn t you hear? They have taught their
domesticated animals musical culture and space
techniques. Even their dogs have a sense of humour.
Why, at this very moment, they may be launching an
interplanetary attack of millions of cows! Notify the

All the King s horses and all the King s men,

Why, sir, he looks like he looks like (turns large
picture of Humpty Dumpty towards Think-Tank and

fall! That means they plan to capture Mars

Noodle, prepare a space capsule for me. I must
escape without delay. Space people, you must leave
Earth at once, but be sure to remove all traces of
your visit. The Earthlings must not know that I
know. (Omega, Iota, and Oop rush about, putting
books back on shelves.)

NooDLE : Where shall we go, sir?

THINK-TANK : A hundred million miles away from Mars. Order the
invasion fleet to evacuate the entire planet of Mars.
We are heading for Alpha Centauri, a hundred million
miles away. (Omega, Iota, and Oop run off right as

HISTORIAN : (chuckling) And that s how one dusty old book of
nursery rhymes saved the world from a Martian
invasion. As you all know, in the twenty-fifth century,
five hundred years after all this happened, we
Earthlings resumed contact with Mars, and we even
became very friendly with the Martians. By that time,
Great and Mighty Think-Tank had been replaced by
a very clever Martian the wise and wonderful
Noodle! Oh, yes, we taught the Martians the difference
between sandwiches and books. We taught them how
to read, too, and we established a model library in
their capital city of Marsopolis. But as you might
expect, there is still one book that the Martians can
never bring themselves to read. You ve guessed it

1. Noodle avoids offending Think-Tank but at the same time he corrects
his mistakes. How does he manage to do that?

2. If you were in Noodle s place, how would you handle Think-Tank s
mistakes?

3. Do you think books are being replaced by the electronic media?
Can we do away with books altogether?

4. Why are books referred to as a man s best companion? Which is
your favourite book and why? Write a paragraph about that book.

1. In what ways does Think-Tank misinterpret innocent nursery
rhymes as threats to the Martians? Can you think of any incidents
where you misinterpreted a word or an action? How did you resolve
the misunderstanding?

Answers given by Professor Yash Pal and Dr Rahul Pal

(see questions on page 38)

(i) DNA exists as strands of bases that carry genetic information
specific to each living thing. The sequence of bases of DNA in
each of our cells is the same, but differs from that of any other
living thing except possibly an identical twin. This difference makes
the DNA break at different places when certain proteins called
enzymes are added to it, resulting in smaller DNA fragments of
different sizes. These fragments migrate at different rates in an
electric field, resulting in a unique pattern; this pattern is referred
to as a DNA fingerprint.

Our DNA is inherited from our parents. Some parts come from
the father and some from the mother. DNA fingerprinting can help
identify parentage, since a son or a daughter would always exhibit
a pattern identifiable as coming from both parents. DNA
fingerprinting analysis is very useful in forensic science; from a
single hair or a tiny spot of blood, it is possible to prove the innocence
or guilt of a murder suspect. Similarly, it is also possible to identify
human remains after violent accidents have caused disfigurement.

It has been suggested that in the not so distant future, a DNA
fingerprinting profile of the individual will have to accompany
applications for an ID card, a bank account and a driving license.
Human right groups say this type of genetic profiling constitutes
an invasion of privacy. As with a lot of new technology, DNA
fingerprinting also has a potential for abuse.

(ii) Honeybees are very sophisticated at position, location and
navigation. It is known that they use the sun as a guide. They
also appear to have a good memory. They convey the information
of a new find of food to the hive through an amazingly clever dance
language. The dance indicates the direction and distance of the
food source with respect to the direction of the sun in the sky! If it
is dark inside the hive and a light bulb is switched on, the dance
is modified to include the light bulb as a new reference direction!
Since bees have pictorial memory of some sort, a direction-finding
mechanism and a way of reckoning distance, they are probably
better equipped for getting back home than any of us!

(iii) Rain is the result of condensation of vapour when the air is cooled

below the dew point. All the vapour in a cloud cannot condense at
the same time and turn into a large pool of water. Pockets of air
move up independently and slowly cool till condensation begins
and water droplets form. It is believed that most raindrops start
out as tiny ice crystals so tiny that they float down, slowly
accreting more moisture on the way; at lower altitudes, the crystals
melt into water droplets. In colder climates, the crystals reach the
ground as snowflakes.
