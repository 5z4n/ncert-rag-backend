11.1 Areas of Sector and Segment of a Circle

You have already come across the terms sector and
segment of a circle in your earlier classes. Recall
that the portion (or part) of the circular region enclosed
by two radii and the corresponding arc is called a
sector of the circle and the portion (or part) of the
circular region enclosed between a chord and the
corresponding arc is called a segment of the circle.
Thus, in Fig. 11.1, shaded region OAPB is a sector
of the circle with centre O. Z AOB is called the

Major
Sector

Fig. 11.1

angle of the sector. Note that in this figure, unshaded region OAQB is also a sector of
the circle. For obvious reasons, OAPB is called the minor sector and
OAQB is called the major sector. You can also see that angle of the major sector is

360 Z AOB.

Now, look at Fig. 11.2 in which AB is a chord
of the circle with centre O. So, shaded region APB is
a segment of the circle. You can also note that
unshaded region AQB is another segment of the circle
formed by the chord AB. For obvious reasons, APB
is called the minor segment and AQB is called the
major segment.

Remark : When we write segment and sector 
we will mean the minor segment and the minor
sector respectively, unless stated otherwise.

Now with this knowledge, let us try to find some
relations (or formulae) to calculate their areas.

Let OAPB be a sector of a circle with centre
O and radius r (see Fig. 11.3). Let the degree
measure of Z AOB be 0.

You know that area of a circle (in fact of a
circular region or disc) is m7 .

In a way, we can consider this circular region to A B
be a sector forming an angle of 360 (1.e., of degree
measure 360) at the centre O. Now by applying the Fig. 11.3
Unitary Method, we can arrive at the area of the
sector OAPB as follows:

When degree measure of the angle at the centre is 360, area of the
sector = mr?

So, when the degree measure of the angle at the centre is 1, area of the
mr?
Therefore, when the degree measure of the angle at the centre is 0, area of the

sector =
tor= xg = ex Wr?
seer 360 360

Thus, we obtain the following relation (or formula) for area of a sector of a
circle:

Area of the sector of angle 0 = xm,
360
where r is the radius of the circle and 0 the angle of the sector in degrees.

Now, a natural question arises : Can we find
the length of the are APB corresponding to this
sector? Yes. Again, by applying the Unitary
Method and taking the whole length of the circle
(of angle 360 ) as 2mr, we can obtain the required
length of th APB as ~*27r.

So, length of an arc of a sector of angle 0 360 x 2m , Fig. 11.4

Now let us take the case of the area of the
segment APB of a circle with centre O and radius r
(see Fig. 11.4). You can see that :

Area of the segment APB = Area of the sector OAPB Area of A OAB

= oy mr area of AOAB
Note : From Fig. 11.3 and Fig. 11.4 respectively, you can observe that:
Area of the major sector OAQB = mr Area of the minor sector OAPB
and Area of major segment AQB = m7 Area of the minor segment APB
Let us now take some examples to understand these concepts (or results).
Example 1 : Find the area of the sector of a circle

with radius 4 cm and of angle 30 . Also, find the area
of the corresponding major sector (Use 1 = 3.14).

Solution : Given sector is OAPB (see Fig. 11.5).

Example 2 : Find the area of the segment AYB

shown in Fig. 11.6, ifradius of the circle is 21 cm and
Z AOB = 120 . (Use mt = 7)

Solution : Area of the segment AYB

Now, area of the sector OAYB = ae x = x 21x 21 cm? = 462 cm? (2)
For finding the area of A OAB, draw OM | AB as shown in Fig. 11.7.
