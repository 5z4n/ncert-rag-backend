INTRODUCTION TO
TRIGONOMETRY

There is perhaps nothing which so occupies the
middle position of mathematics as trigonometry.

8.1 Introduction

You have already studied about triangles, and in particular, right triangles, in your
earlier classes. Let us take some examples from our surroundings where right triangles
can be imagined to be formed. For instance :
1. Suppose the students of a school are
visiting Qutub Minar. Now, if a student
is looking at the top of the Minar, a right
triangle can be imagined to be made,
as shown in Fig 8.1. Can the student
find out the height of the Minar, without
actually measuring it?

2. Suppose a girl is sitting on the balcony
of her house located on the bank of a Fig. 8.1
river. She is looking down at a flower
pot placed ona stairofatemple situated

nearby on the other bank of the river. __. G
A right triangle is imagined to be made Acs i. mo, A
in this situation as shown in Fig.8.2. If 

you know the height at which the
person is sitting, can you find the width

of the river?

3. Suppose a hot air balloon is flying in
the air. A girl happens to spot the
balloon in the sky and runs to her @, @)
mother to tell her about it. Her mother ow B
rushes out of the house to look at the
balloon.Now when the girl had spotted
the balloon intially it was at point A.
When both the mother and daughter woe 8
came out to see it, it had already ie ce See i a?
travelled to another point B. Can you ;
find the altitude of B from the ground? Fig. 8.3

In all the situations given above, the distances or heights can be found by using
some mathematical techniques, which come under a branch of mathematics called
 trigonometry . The word trigonometry is derived from the Greek words tri 
(meaning three), gon (meaning sides) and metron (meaning measure). In fact,
trigonometry is the study of relationships between the sides and angles of a triangle.
The earliest known work on trigonometry was recorded in Egypt and Babylon. Early
astronomers used it to find out the distances of the stars and planets from the Earth.
Even today, most of the technologically advanced methods used in Engineering and
Physical Sciences are based on trigonometrical concepts.

In this chapter, we will study some ratios of the sides of a right triangle with
respect to its acute angles, called trigonometric ratios of the angle. We will restrict
our discussion to acute angles only. However, these ratios can be extended to other
angles also. We will also define the trigonometric ratios for angles of measure 0 and
90 . We will calculate trigonometric ratios for some specific angles and establish
some identities involving these ratios, called trigonometric identities.

acute angle. Note the position of the side BC 
with respect to angle A. It faces Z A. We call it A B =

the side opposite to angle A. AC is the Side adjacent to
hypotenuse of the right triangle and the side AB angle A
is a part of Z A. So, we call it the side

adjacent to angle A. Fig. 8.4

So, the trigonometric ratios of an acute angle in a right triangle express the
relationship between the angle and the length of its sides.

Why don t you try to define the trigonometric ratios for angle C in the right
triangle? (See Fig. 8.5)

116 MATHEMATICS

The first use of the idea of sine in the way we use
it today was in the work Aryabhatiyam by Aryabhata,
in A.D. 500. Aryabhata used the word ardha-jya
for the half-chord, which was shortened to jya or
jiva in due course. When the Aryabhatiyam was
translated into Arabic, the word jiva was retained as
it is. The word jiva was translated into sinus, which
means curve, when the Arabic version was translated
into Latin. Soon the word sinus, also used as sine,

became common in mathematical texts throughout
Europe. An English Professor of astronomy Edmund
Gunter (1581-1626), first used the abbreviated Aryabhata

notation sin . C.E. 476- 550
The origin of the terms cosine and tangent was much later. The cosine function
arose from the need to compute the sine of the complementary angle. Aryabhatta
called it kotijya. The name cosinus originated with Edmund Gunter. In 1674, the
English Mathematician Sir Jonas Moore first used the abbreviated notation cos .

Remark : Note that the symbol sin A is used as an

abbreviation for the sine of the angle A . sin A is not

the product of sin and A. sin separated from A

has no meaning. Similarly, cos A is not the product of

 cos and A. Similar interpretations follow for other P
trigonometric ratios also.

Now, if we take a point P on the hypotenuse Hypotenuse
AC or a point Q on AC extended, of the right triangle
ABC and draw PM perpendicular to AB and QN A 3
perpendicular to AB extended (see Fig. 8.6), how M BN
will the trigonometric ratios of Z A in A PAM differ
from those of Z Ain A CAB or from those of Z Ain Fig. 8.6
A QAN?

To answer this, first look at these triangles. Is A PAM similar to A CAB? From
Chapter 6, recall the AA similarity criterion. Using the criterion, you will see that the
triangles PAM and CAB are similar. Therefore, by the property of similar triangles,
the corresponding sides of the triangles are proportional.

Similarly, = = cosA, = = tan A and so on.
 AP AC AM AB

This shows that the trigonometric ratios of angle A in A PAM not differ from
those of angle A in A CAB.

In the same way, you should check that the value of sin A (and also of other
trigonometric ratios) remains the same in A QAN also.

From our observations, it is now clear that the values of the trigonometric
ratios of an angle do not vary with the lengths of the sides of the triangle, if
the angle remains the same.

Note : For the sake of convenience, we may write sin A, cos A, etc., in place of
(sin A) , (cos A) , etc., respectively. But cosec A= (sin A)! sin! A (it is called sine
inverse A). sin! A has a different meaning, which will be discussed in higher classes.
Similar conventions hold for the other trigonometric ratios as well. Sometimes, the
Greek letter 6 (theta) is also used to denote an angle.

We have defined six trigonometric ratios of an acute angle. If we know any one
of the ratios, can we obtain the other ratios? Let us see.

1 C
If in a right triangle ABC, sin A= 3 
then this means that AC = 3 , 1.e., the 3h k
lengths of the sides BC and AC of the triangle
ABC are in the ratio | : 3 (see Fig. 8.7).Soif A B
BC is equal to k, then AC will be 3k, where Fig. 8.7

k is any positive number. To determine other
trigonometric ratios for the angle A, we need to find the length of the third side
AB. Do you remember the Pythagoras theorem? Let us use it to determine the
required length AB.

AB? = AC? BC? = (3k) (k)? = 8 = (2V2 kb?

Therefore, AB= + 2/2 k

So, we get AB= 2J/2k (Why is AB not 2,/2k ?)

AB 22k _ 2V2
AC 3k 3
Similarly, you can obtain the other trigonometric ratios of the angle A.

Now, cos A=

Reprint 2025-26

Remark : Since the hypotenuse is the longest side in a right triangle, the value of
sin A or cos A 1s always less than 1 (or, in particular, equal to 1).

Let us consider some examples.

BC
sin A = AC is very close to 0. Also, when Z A is very close to 0 , AC is nearly the

same as AB and so the value of cos A= AC is very close to 1.

This helps us to see how we can define the values of sin A and cos A when
A= 0 . We define : sin 0 = 0 and cos 0 = 1.

Now, let us see what happens to the trigonometric ratios of Z A, when it is made

larger and larger in A ABC till it becomes 90 . As Z A gets larger and larger, 7 C gets

smaller and smaller. Therefore, as in the case above, the length of the side AB goes on

decreasing. The point A gets closer to point B. Finally when Z A is very close to 90 ,

Z C becomes very close to 0 and the side AC almost coincides with side BC

Z Cis very close to 0 , and the side AB is nearly zero, so cos A is very close to 0.

So, we define : sin 90 = 1 and cos 90 = 0.
Now, why don t you find the other trigonometric ratios of 90 ?

Example 12 : Prove that > using the identity

sin @+cos@ 1 sec @ tan 0
sec? 8 = 1 + tan? 0.
Solution : Since we will apply the identity involving sec @ and tan 9, let us first

convert the LHS (of the identity we need to prove) in terms of sec 0 and tan 0 by
dividing numerator and denominator by cos 0.

sin cos@+1_ tan@ 1+sec@
sin@+cos@ 1 tan@+1-sec 0

LHS =

(tanO+sec9) 1 _ {(tan 0+ sec 0) 1} (tan @ sec @)
(tanO@ sec@)+1 {(tan 6 sec 8)+ 1} (tan @ sec 0)

(tan* @ sec @) (tan @ sec 8)
