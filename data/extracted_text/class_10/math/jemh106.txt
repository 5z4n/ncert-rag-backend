6.1 Introduction

You are familiar with triangles and many of their properties from your earlier classes.
In Class IX, you have studied congruence of triangles in detail. Recall that two figures
are said to be congruent, if they have the same shape and the same size. In this
chapter, we shall study about those figures which have the same shape but not necessarily
the same size. Two figures having the same shape (and not necessarily the same size)
are called similar figures. In particular, we shall discuss the similarity of triangles and
apply this knowledge in giving a simple proof of Pythagoras Theorem learnt earlier.

Can you guess how heights of mountains (say Mount Everest) or distances of
some long distant objects (say moon) have been found out? Do you think these have

WAH! WAH!
AAH! Soon T will

to measure the
height of the

been measured directly with the help of a measuring tape? In fact, all these heights
and distances have been found out using the idea of indirect measurements, which is
based on the principle of similarity of figures (see Example 7, Q.15 of Exercise 6.3
and also Chapters 8 and 9 of this book).

6.2 Similar Figures

In Class IX, you have seen that all circles with the same radii are congruent, all
squares with the same side lengths are congruent and all equilateral triangles with the

same side lengths are congruent.
Now consider any two (or more)
circles [see Fig. 6.1 (i)]. Are they
congruent? Since all of them do not
have the same radius, they are not
(i)

congruent to each other. Note that
some are congruent and some are not,

but all of them have the same shape.
So they all are, what we call, similar.
Two similar figures have the same
shape but not necessarily the same
size. Therefore, all circles are similar. | |
What about two (or more) squares or

two (or more) equilateral triangles (ii)
[see Fig. 6.1 (ii) and (iii)]? As observed
in the case of circles, here also all

squares are similar and all equilateral
triangles are similar. 2
From the above, we can say

that all congruent figures are (iii)
similar but the similar figures need
not be congruent. Fig. 6.1

Can a circle and a square be

Pp S
similar? Can a triangle and a square 
be similar? These questions can be
answered by just looking at the
figures (see Fig. 6.1). Evidently B c Q

these figures are not similar. (Why?)

What can you say about the two quadrilaterals ABCD and PQRS
(see Fig 6.2)?Are they similar? These figures appear to be similar but we cannot be
certain about it. Therefore, we must have some definition of similarity of figures and
based on this definition some rules to decide whether the two given figures are similar
or not. For this, let us look at the photographs given in Fig. 6.3:

Fig. 6.3

You will at once say that they are the photographs of the same monument
(Taj Mahal) but are in different sizes. Would you say that the three photographs are
similar? Yes,they are.

What can you say about the two photographs of the same size of the same
person one at the age of 10 years and the other at the age of 40 years? Are these
photographs similar? These photographs are of the same size but certainly they are
not of the same shape. So, they are not similar.

What does the photographer do when she prints photographs of different sizes
from the same negative? You must have heard about the stamp size, passport size and
postcard size photographs. She generally takes a photograph on a small size film, say
of 35mm size and then enlarges it into a bigger size, say 45mm (or 55mm). Thus, if we
consider any line segment in the smaller photograph (figure), its corresponding line

45 55
segment in the bigger photograph (figure) will be 35 fo =) of that of the line segment.

This really means that every line segment of the smaller photograph is enlarged
(increased) in the ratio 35:45 (or 35:55). It can also be said that every line segment
of the bigger photograph is reduced (decreased) in the ratio 45:35 (or 55:35). Further,
if you consider inclinations (or angles) between any pair of corresponding line segments
in the two photographs of different sizes, you shall see that these inclinations(or angles)
are always equal. This is the essence of the similarity of two figures and in particular
of two polygons. We say that:

Two polygons of the same number of sides are similar, if (i) their
corresponding angles are equal and (ii) their corresponding sides are in the
same ratio (or proportion).

Reprint 2025-26

76 MATHEMATICS

Note that the same ratio of the corresponding sides is referred to as the scale
factor (or the Representative Fraction) for the polygons. You must have heard that
world maps (i.e., global maps) and blue prints for the construction of a building are
prepared using a suitable scale factor and observing certain conventions.

In order to understand similarity of figures more clearly, let us perform the following
activity:
Activity 1: Place a lighted bulb at a Oo
point O on the ceiling and directly below
it a table in your classroom. Let us cut a
polygon, say a quadrilateral ABCD, from
a plane cardboard and place this
cardboard parallel to the ground between
the lighted bulb and the table. Then a
shadow of ABCD is cast on the table.
Mark the outline of this shadow as
A B C'D (see Fig.6.4).
Note that the quadrilateral A B C D is
an enlargement (or magnification) of the
quadrilateral ABCD. This is because of
the property of light that light propogates
in a straight line. You may also note that
A lies on ray OA, B lies on ray OB, C 
lies on OC and D lies on OD. Thus, quadrilaterals A B C D and ABCD are of the
same shape but of different sizes.

So, quadrilateral A B C D is similiar to quadrilateral ABCD. We can also say
that quadrilateral ABCD is similar to the quadrilateral A B C D .

Here, you can also note that vertex A corresponds to vertex A, vertex B 
corresponds to vertex B, vertex C corresponds to vertex C and vertex D corresponds
to vertex D. Symbolically, these correspondences are represented as A A, B OB,
C C and D D. By actually measuring the angles and the sides of the two
quadrilaterals, you may verify that

(i) ZA=ZA ,ZB=ZB ,,ZC=2ZC,ZD=ZD' and

.. AB _ BC _ CD __ DA

() Vp BC CD DAY

This again emphasises that two polygons of the same number of sides are

similar, if (i) all the corresponding angles are equal and (ii) all the corresponding
sides are in the same ratio (or proportion).

Reprint 2025-26

From the above, you can easily say that quadrilaterals ABCD and PQRS of
Fig. 6.5 are similar.

Fig. 6.5

Remark : You can verify that if one polygon is similar to another polygon and this
second polygon is similar to a third polygon, then the first polygon is similar to the third
polygon.

You may note that in the two quadrilaterals (a square and a rectangle) of

Fig. 6.6, corresponding angles are equal, but their corresponding sides are not in the
same ratio.

So, the two quadrilaterals are not similar. Similarly, you may note that in the two
quadrilaterals (a square and a rhombus) of Fig. 6.7, corresponding sides are in the

same ratio, but their corresponding angles are not equal. Again, the two polygons
(quadrilaterals) are not similar.

6.3 Similarity of Triangles
What can you say about the similarity of two triangles?

You may recall that triangle is also a polygon. So, we can state the same conditions
for the similarity of two triangles. That is:

Two triangles are similiar, if
(i) their corresponding angles are equal and
(ii) their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion).

Note that if corresponding angles of two
triangles are equal, then they are known as
equiangular_ triangles. A famous Greek
mathematician Thales gave an important truth relating
to two equiangular triangles which is as follows:

The ratio of any two corresponding sides in
two equiangular triangles is always the same.

It is believed that he had used a result called
the Basic Proportionality Theorem (now known as
the Thales Theorem) for the same. Thales

(640 546 B.C.)

To understand the Basic Proportionality
Theorem, let us perform the following activity:

Activity 2: Draw any angle XAY and on its one
arm AX, mark points (say five points) P, Q, D, Rand
B such that AP = PQ = QD = DR = RB.

Now, through B, draw any line intersecting arm
AY at C (see Fig. 6.9).

Also, through the point D, draw a line parallel
to BC to intersect AC at E. Do you observe from

ar(ADE) = 5 AE x DM and ar(DEC) = 5 EC x DM.

Is the converse of this theorem also true (For the meaning of converse, see
Appendix 1)? To examine this, let us perform the following activity:

Activity 3: Draw an angle XAY on your
notebook and on ray AX, mark points B,, B,,
B,, B, and B such that AB, = B,B, = B,B,
B,B, = B,B.

Similarly, on ray AY, mark points
C,, C,, C,, C, and C such that AC, = C,C, =
C,C, = C,C, = C,C. Then join B,C, and BC
(see Fig. 6.11).

Note that

You can also see that lines B,C, and BC are parallel to each other, i.e.,

BB C,c \ 1

From (1), (2), (3) and (4), it can be observed that if a line divides two sides of a
triangle in the same ratio, then the line is parallel to the third side.

You can repeat this activity by drawing any angle XAY of different measure and
taking any number of equal parts on arms AX and AY . Each time, you will arrive at
the same result. Thus, we obtain the following theorem, which is the converse of
Theorem 6.1:

Now a natural question arises : For checking the similarity of two triangles, say
ABC and DEF, should we always look for all the equality relations of their corresponding
angles (ZA= 2D, ZB=ZE, Z C= ZF) and all the equality relations of the ratios

(AB BC _ CA

in Class IX, you have obtained some criteria for congruency of two triangles involving
only three pairs of corresponding parts (or elements) of the two triangles. Here also,
let us make an attempt to arrive at certain criteria for similarity of two triangles involving
relationship between less number of pairs of corresponding parts of the two triangles,
instead ofall the six pairs of corresponding parts. For this, let us perform the following
activity:

Activity 4 : Draw two line segments BC and EF of two different lengths, say 3 cm
and 5 cm respectively. Then, at the points B and C respectively, construct angles PBC
and QCB of some measures, say, 60 and 40 . Also, at the points E and F, construct
angles REF and SFE of 60 and 40 respectively (see Fig. 6.23).

corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion) and hence the two

triangles are similar. D

If two angles of one triangle are respectively equal to two angles of another
triangle, then the two triangles are similar.

This may be referred to as the AA similarity criterion for two triangles.

You have seen above that if the three angles of one triangle are respectively
equal to the three angles of another triangle, then their corresponding sides are
proportional (i.e., in the same ratio). What about the converse of this statement? Is the
converse true? In other words, if the sides of a triangle are respectively proportional to
the sides of another triangle, is it true that their corresponding angles are equal? Let us
examine it through an activity :

Now measure Z A, ZB, Z C, Z D, Z E and Z F. You will observe that
ZA=Z2D,2ZB=ZEand 7C=ZF,ie., the corresponding angles of the two
triangles are equal.

You can repeat this activity by drawing several such triangles (having their sides
in the same ratio). Everytime you shall see that their corresponding angles are equal.
Itis due to the following criterion of similarity of two triangles:

Theorem 6.4 : [f in two triangles, sides of one triangle are proportional to
(i.e., in the same ratio of ) the sides of the other triangle, then their corresponding
angles are equal and hence the two triangles are similiar.

This criterion is referred to as the SSS (Side Side Side) similarity criterion for

Remark : You may recall that either of the two conditions namely, (i) corresponding
angles are equal and (11) corresponding sides are in the same ratio is not sufficient for
two polygons to be similar. However, on the basis of Theorems 6.3 and 6.4, you can
now Say that in case of similarity of the two triangles, it is not necessary to check both
the conditions as one condition implies the other.

Let us now recall the various criteria for congruency of two triangles learnt in
Class IX. You may observe that SSS similarity criterion can be compared with the SSS
congruency criterion. This suggests us to look for a similarity criterion comparable to
SAS congruency criterion of triangles. For this, let us perform an activity.

is, one angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of another triangle and sides including
these angles are in the same ratio (i.e., proportion). Now let us measure Z B, Z C,
ZEand ZF.

You will find that Z B= Z Eand Z C= ZF. Thatis, ZA= 2D, Z B= ZEand
ZC=ZE. So, by AAA similarity criterion, A ABC ~ A DEF. You may repeat this
activity by drawing several pairs of such triangles with one angle of a triangle equal to
one angle of another triangle and the sides including these angles are proportional.
Everytime, you will find that the triangles are similar. It is due to the following criterion
of similarity of triangles:

Theorem 6.5 : If one angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of the other
triangle and the sides including these angles are proportional, then the two
triangles are similar.

Solution : Let AB denote the lamp-post
and CD the girl after walking for 4 seconds
away from the lamp-post (see Fig. 6.32).

From the figure, you can see that DE is the
shadow of the girl. Let DE be x metres.

Now, BD = 1.2m x 4=4.8 m.
Note that in A ABE and A CDE,

ZB=ZD __ (Each is of 90 because lamp-post
as well as the girl are standing

vertical to the ground)
and ZE=ZE (Same angle)
So, A ABE ~ A CDE (AA similarity criterion)
Therefore BE = AB
 DE CD
i.e., A8hx _ 3.6 (90 cm = A m= 0.9 m)
x 0.9 100
1. ., 48+x= 4x
L.e., 3x = 48
1. ., x= 1.6

So, the shadow of the girl after walking for 4 seconds is 1.6 m long.

6.5 Summary

In this chapter you have studied the following points :

1.

Two figures having the same shape but not necessarily the same size are called similar
figures.

. All the congruent figures are similar but the converse is not true.
. Two polygons of the same number of sides are similar, if (i) their corresponding angles

are equal and (i1) their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (i.e., proportion).

. Ifa line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle to intersect the other two sides in

distinct points, then the other two sides are divided in the same ratio.

. Ifaline divides any two sides of a triangle in the same ratio, then the line is parallel to the

third side.

. Ifintwo triangles, corresponding angles are equal, then their corresponding sides are in

the same ratio and hence the two triangles are similar (AAA similarity criterion).

. Ifintwo triangles, two angles of one triangle are respectively equal to the two angles of

the other triangle, then the two triangles are similar (AA similarity criterion).

8. If in two triangles, corresponding sides are in the same ratio, then their corresponding
angles are equal and hence the triangles are similar (SSS similarity criterion).

9. If one angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of another triangle and the sides including
these angles are in the same ratio (proportional), then the triangles are similar
(SAS similarity criterion).

A NOTE TO THE READER

If in two right triangles, hypotenuse and one side of one triangle are
proportional to the hypotenuse and one side of the other triangle,

then the two triangles are similar. This may be referred to as the
RHS Similarity Criterion.

If you use this criterion in Example 2, Chapter 8, the proof will become
simpler.
