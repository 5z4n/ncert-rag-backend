QUADRATIC EQUATIONS

4.1 Introduction

In Chapter 2, you have studied different types of polynomials. One type was the
quadratic polynomial of the form ax? + bx + c, a # 0. When we equate this polynomial
to zero, we get a quadratic equation. Quadratic equations come up when we deal with
many real-life situations. For instance, suppose a
charity trust decides to build a prayer hall having
a carpet area of 300 square metres with its length
one metre more than twice its breadth. What
should be the length and breadth of the hall?
Suppose the breadth of the hall is x metres. Then, xw+1
its length should be (2x + 1) metres. We can depict

this information pictorially as shown in Fig. 4.1. Fig. 4.1

Now, area of the hall = (2x + 1). x m? = (2x? + x) m?
So, 2x? +x = 300 (Given)
Therefore, 2x? +x 300 = 0

So, the breadth of the hall should satisfy the equation 2x? + x 300 = 0 which is a
quadratic equation.

x 300 m2?

Many people believe that Babylonians were the first to solve quadratic equations.
For instance, they knew how to find two positive numbers with a given positive sum
and a given positive product, and this problem is equivalent to solving a quadratic
equation of the form x? px + q = 0. Greek mathematician Euclid developed a
geometrical approach for finding out lengths which, in our present day terminology,
are solutions of quadratic equations. Solving of quadratic equations, in general form, is
often credited to ancient Indian mathematicians. In fact, Brahmagupta (C.E.598 665)
gave an explicit formula to solve a quadratic equation of the form ax + bx = c. Later,

Sridharacharya (C.E. 1025) derived a formula, now known as the quadratic formula,
(as quoted by Bhaskara II) for solving a quadratic equation by the method of completing
the square. An Arab mathematician Al-Khwarizmi (about C.E. 800) also studied
quadratic equations of different types. Abraham bar Hiyya Ha-Nasi, in his book
 Liber embadorum published in Europe in C.E. 1145 gave complete solutions of
different quadratic equations.

In this chapter, you will study quadratic equations, and various ways of finding
their roots. You will also see some applications of quadratic equations in daily life
situations.

4.2 Quadratic Equations

A quadratic equation in the variable x is an equation of the form ax? + bx +c =0, where
a, b, c are real numbers, a # 0. For example, 2x + x 300 = 0 is a quadratic equation.
Similarly, 2x? 3x + 1 = 0, 4x 3x? + 2 = 0 and 1 x* + 300 = 0 are also quadratic
equations.

In fact, any equation of the form p(x) = 0, where p(x) is a polynomial of degree
2, is a quadratic equation. But when we write the terms of p(x) in descending order of
their degrees, then we get the standard form of the equation. That is, ax? + bx +c =0,
a # 0 is called the standard form of a quadratic equation.

Quadratic equations arise in several situations in the world around us and in
different fields of mathematics. Let us consider a few examples.

Example 1 : Represent the following situations mathematically:

(i) John and Jivanti together have 45 marbles. Both of them lost 5 marbles each, and
the product of the number of marbles they now have is 124. We would like to find
out how many marbles they had to start with.

(ii) A cottage industry produces a certain number of toys in a day. The cost of
production of each toy (in rupees) was found to be 55 minus the number of toys
produced in a day. On a particular day, the total cost of production was
% 750. We would like to find out the number of toys produced on that day.

Solution :
(i) Let the number of marbles John had be x.
Then the number of marbles Jivanti had = 45 x (Why ?).
The number of marbles left with John, when he lost 5 marbles = x 5
The number of marbles left with Jivanti, when she lost 5 marbles = 45 x 5
= 40-x

Therefore, their product = (x 5) (40 x)
= 40x x? 200 + 5x

= x?+ 45x 200
So, x? + 45x 200 = 124 (Given that product = 124)
ie, 2 +45x-324=0
i.e., x? 45x + 324 = 0

Therefore, the number of marbles John had, satisfies the quadratic equation
x? 45x + 324 = 0
which is the required representation of the problem mathematically.
(ii) Let the number of toys produced on that day be x.
Therefore, the cost of production (in rupees) of each toy that day = 55 x
So, the total cost of production (in rupees) that day = x (55 x)

Therefore, x (55 x) = 750
L.e., 55x x* = 750
i.e., x?+ 55x 750 = 0
L.e., x? 55x + 750 = 0

Therefore, the number of toys produced that day satisfies the quadratic equation
x 55x + 750 = 0

which is the required representation of the problem mathematically.

Example 2 : Check whether the following are quadratic equations:
(i) @-2)+1=2x-3 (ii) x(x + 1) + 8 =(x + 2) (X-2)

(iii) x (2x + 3)=x2+1 (iv) (x +2 =3 4

Solution :
(i) LHS=(@@- 2+ 1=.2?- 4 +441=x2- 4x45

Therefore, (x 2)?+ 1 = 2x 3 can be rewritten as
x 4x +5 = 2x-3
i.e., x- 6x+8=0

It is of the form ax? + bx + c=0.

Therefore, the given equation is a quadratic equation.

(ii) Since x(x + 1) +8 =x? +x+ 8 and (x + 2)(x 2) =x? -4
Therefore, xrP+x+8=x7-4
1. ., x+12=0
It is not of the form ax? + bx + c= 0.

Therefore, the given equation is not a quadratic equation.
(it) Here, LHS = x (2x + 3) = 2x? + 3x
So, x (2x + 3) = x? + 1 can be rewritten as
2x + 3x = 2x? 4+1
Therefore, we get x +3x-1=0
It is of the form ax? + bx +c = 0.

So, the given equation is a quadratic equation.

(iv) Here, LHS = (x + 2)? = x3 + 6x? + 12x +8
Therefore, (x + 2) = x 4 can be rewritten as
x3 + 6x? + 12x+8=x3-4
i.e., 6x +12x+12=0 or, x+2x+2=0

It is of the form ax? + bx + c= 0.
So, the given equation is a quadratic equation.

Remark : Be careful! In (ii) above, the given equation appears to be a quadratic
equation, but it is not a quadratic equation.

In (iv) above, the given equation appears to be a cubic equation (an equation of
degree 3) and not a quadratic equation. But it turns out to be a quadratic equation. As
you can see, often we need to simplify the given equation before deciding whether it
is quadratic or not.

4.3 Solution of a Quadratic Equation by Factorisation

Consider the quadratic equation 2x? 3x + 1 = 0. If we replace x by 1 on the
LHS of this equation, we get (2 x 1 ) (3 x 1) + 1 = 0 = RHS of the equation.
We say that | is a root of the quadratic equation 2x? 3x + 1 = 0. This also means that
1 is a zero of the quadratic polynomial 2x? 3x + 1.

In general, a real number is called a root of the quadratic equation
ax + bx +c=0,a40ifao +ba+c=0. We also say that x = a is a solution of
the quadratic equation, or that o satisfies the quadratic equation. Note that the
zeroes of the quadratic polynomial ax? + bx + c and the roots of the quadratic
equation ax + bx + c= 0 are the same.

You have observed, in Chapter 2, that a quadratic polynomial can have at most
two zeroes. So, any quadratic equation can have atmost two roots.

You have learnt in Class IX, how to factorise quadratic polynomials by splitting
their middle terms. We shall use this knowledge for finding the roots of a quadratic
equation. Let us see how.

Example 3 : Find the roots of the equation 2x* 5x + 3 = 0, by factorisation.
Solution : Let us first split the middle term 5x as 2x 3x [because ( 2x) x ( 3x) =
6x? = (2x ) x 3].

So, 2x? 5x +3 = 2x? 2x -3x+3 = 2x (x- 1) -3@- 1) = (2x 3)(x- 1)

Now, 2x? 5x + 3 = 0 can be rewritten as (2x 3)(x 1) = 0.

So, the values of x for which 2x? 5x + 3 = 0 are the same for which (2x 3)(x 1) = 0,
i.e., either 2x -3 = 0 orx 1=0.
Now, 2x 3 = 0 gives x=5 and x 1=0 gives x= 1.
So, X= 5 and x = 1 are the solutions of the equation.
In other words, 1 and 5 are the roots of the equation 2x? 5x +3=0.

Verify that these are the roots of the given equation.

QUADRATIC EQUATIONS 43

Note that we have found the roots of 2x? 5x + 3 = 0 by factorising
2x* 5x + 3 into two linear factors and equating each factor to zero.

Example 4 : Find the roots of the quadratic equation 6x? x 2 = 0.
Solution : We have
6x? x 2 = 6x? + 3x 4x 2
= 3x (2x + 1) -2 (2x + 1)
= (3x 2)(2x + 1)
The roots of 6x? x 2 = 0 are the values of x for which (3x 2)(2x + 1) =0
Therefore, 3x 2 = 0 or 2x + 1 =0,

1. . xXx= > or x=-z

2 1
Therefore, the roots of 6x2 x 2 = 0 are 5 and 5

2 1
We verify the roots, by checking that 3 and ~,, satisfy 6x? -x-2=0.
Example 5 : Find the roots of the quadratic equation 3x? 2./6x+2=0.

Solution : 3x? 2./6x+2 = 3x? -J6x J6x+2
= V3x(V/3x - V2) - V2(/3x- V2)
= (V3x- V2)(V3x-v2)

So, the roots of the equation are the values of x for which

(J3 x-V2)(V3x- V2) =0
Now, /3x /2 =0 for ve?

So, this root is repeated twice, one for each repeated factor V3x J2 .

Therefore, the roots of 3x? 2,/6x+2=0 are 2 , 2.

Example 6 : Find the dimensions of the prayer hall discussed in Section 4.1.

Solution : In Section 4.1, we found that if the breadth of the hall is x m, then x
satisfies the equation 2x* + x 300 = 0. Applying the factorisation method, we write
this equation as

2x? 24x + 25x 300 = 0
2x (x 12) +25 ( - 12) = 0
L.e., (x 12)(2x + 25) = 0

So, the roots of the given equation are x = 12 or x = 12.5. Since x is the breadth
of the hall, it cannot be negative.

Thus, the breadth of the hall is 12 m. Its length = 2x + 1 =25 m.

 b
So, the roots of the equation ax? + bx + c = 0 are both oa
a

Therefore, we say that the quadratic equation ax + bx + c = 0 has two equal
real roots in this case.

If 6? 4ac < 0, then there is no real number whose square is b? 4ac. Therefore,
there are no real roots for the given quadratic equation in this case.
Since b? 4ac determines whether the quadratic equation ax + bx + c = 0 has
real roots or not, b? 4ac is called the discriminant of this quadratic equation.
So, a quadratic equation ax* + bx + c =0 has
(i) two distinct real roots, if b? 4ac > 0,
(ii) two equal real roots, if b? 4ac = 0,
(iii) no real roots, if b? 4ac < 0.

Let us consider some examples.

Example 7: Find the discriminant of the quadratic equation 2x? 4x + 3 = 0, and
hence find the nature of its roots.

Solution : The given equation is of the form ax + bx + c= 0, where a = 2, b= 4 and
c= 3. Therefore, the discriminant

b? 4ac = ( 4)?- (4x 2 x 3)=16-24=-8 <0

So, the given equation has no real roots.

Example 8 : A pole has to be erected at a point on the boundary of a circular park of
diameter 13 metres in such a way that the differences of its distances from two
diametrically opposite fixed gates A and B on the boundary is 7 metres. Is it possible to
do so? If yes, at what distances from the two gates should the es be erected?

Solution : Let us first draw the diagram
(see Fig. 4.2).

Let P be the required location of the
pole. Let the distance of the pole from the
gate B be x m, i.e., BP = x m. Now the
difference of the distances of the pole from
the two gates = AP BP (or, BP AP) =
7m. Therefore, AP = (x + 7) m.

Reprint 2025-26

46 MATHEMATICS

Now, AB = 13m, and since AB is a diameter,
ZAPB = 90 (Why?)

Therefore, AP? + PB? = AB? (By Pythagoras theorem)
i.e., (x +7)? +x = 13?
L.e., x? + 14x +49+x?= 169
i.e., 2x + 14x 120 = 0
So, the distance x of the pole from gate B satisfies the equation
x + 7x 60 = 0

So, it would be possible to place the pole if this equation has real roots. To see if this
is so or not, let us consider its discriminant. The discriminant is

b? 4ac = 7? 4 x 1 x ( 60) = 289>0.

So, the given quadratic equation has two real roots, and it is possible to erect the
pole on the boundary of the park.

Solving the quadratic equation x? + 7x 60 = 0, by the quadratic formula, we get

_ -7+ 289 | -7+17
2 2

Therefore, x = 5 or 12.

Since x is the distance between the pole and the gate B, it must be positive.
Therefore, x = 12 will have to be ignored. So, x = 5.

Thus, the pole has to be erected on the boundary of the park at a distance of 5m
from the gate B and 12m from the gate A.
Example 9 : Find the discriminant of the equation 3x? 2x + 37 0 and hence find the
nature of its roots. Find them, if they are real.
Solution : Here a = 3, b = 2 and cas.
Therefore, discriminant b* 4ac = ( 2)?- 4.x 3 x 3 4-4=0.

Hence, the given quadratic equation has two equal real roots.
