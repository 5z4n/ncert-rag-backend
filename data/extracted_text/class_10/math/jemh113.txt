13.1 Introduction

In Class IX, you have studied the classification of given data into ungrouped as well as
grouped frequency distributions. You have also learnt to represent the data pictorially
in the form of various graphs such as bar graphs, histograms (including those of varying
widths) and frequency polygons. In fact, you went a step further by studying certain
numerical representatives of the ungrouped data, also called measures of central
tendency, namely, mean, median and mode. In this chapter, we shall extend the study
of these three measures, i.e., mean, median and mode from ungrouped data to that of
grouped data. We shall also discuss the concept of cumulative frequency, the
cumulative frequency distribution and how to draw cumulative frequency curves, called
ogives.

13.2 Mean of Grouped Data

The mean (or average) of observations, as we know, is the sum of the values of all the
observations divided by the total number of observations. From Class IX, recall that if
XX)... X, are observations with respective frequencies f,, f,, ..., f, then this
means observation x, occurs f, times, x, occurs f, times, and so on.

Now, the sum of the values of all the observations = fix, +fx,+...+fx,, and
the number of observations =f, +f,+...+f.

So, the mean x of the data is given by
y= AX + foxy Fo FSX

Recall that we can write this in short form by using the Greek letter X (capital
sigma) which means summation. That is,

which, more briefly, is written as = , if itis understood that 7 varies from
1 ton.

Let us apply this formula to find the mean in the following example.

The marks obtained by 30 students of Class X of a certain school in a
Mathematics paper consisting of 100 marks are presented in table below. Find the
mean of the marks obtained by the students.

Recall that to find the mean marks, we require the product of each x, with
the corresponding frequency f.. So, let us put them in a column as shown in Table 13.1.

Therefore, the mean marks obtained is 59.3.

In most of our real life situations, data is usually so large that to make a meaningful
study it needs to be condensed as grouped data. So, we need to convert given ungrouped
data into grouped data and devise some method to find its mean.

Let us convert the ungrouped data of Example | into grouped data by forming
class-intervals of width, say 15. Remember that, while allocating frequencies to each
class-interval, students falling in any upper class-limit would be considered in the next
class, e.g., 4 students who have obtained 40 marks would be considered in the classinterval 40-55 and not in 25-40. With this convention in our mind, let us form a grouped
frequency distribution table (see Table 13.2).

Table 13.2

Now, for each class-interval, we require a point which would serve as the
representative of the whole class. Jt is assumed that the frequency of each classinterval is centred around its mid-point. So the mid-point (or class mark) of each
class can be chosen to represent the observations falling in the class. Recall that we
find the mid-point of a class (or its class mark) by finding the average of its upper and
lower limits. That is,

Upper class limit + Lower class limit
Class mark =

10+ 25
17.5. Similarly, we can find the class marks of the remaining class intervals. We put
them in Table 13.3. These class marks serve as our x, s. Now, in general, for the ith
class interval, we have the frequency f corresponding to the class mark x,. We can

now proceed to compute the mean in the same manner as in Example 1.

With reference to Table 13.2, for the class 10-25, the class mark is ,1.e.,

The sum of the values in the last column gives us X f,x,. So, the mean x of the
given data is given by

This new method of finding the mean is known as the Direct Method.

xX =

We observe that Tables 13.1 and 13.3 are using the same data and employing the
same formula for the calculation of the mean but the results obtained are different.
Can you think why this is so, and which one is more accurate? The difference in the
two values is because of the mid-point assumption in Table 13.3, 59.3 being the exact
mean, while 62 an approximate mean.

Sometimes when the numerical values of x, and f, are large, finding the product
of x, and f, becomes tedious and time consuming. So, for such situations, let us think of
a method of reducing these calculations.

We can do nothing with the fs, but we can change each x, to a smaller number
so that our calculations become easy. How do we do this? What about subtracting a
fixed number from each of these x, s? Let us try this method.

The first step is to choose one among the x s as the assumed mean, and denote
it by a . Also, to further reduce our calculation work, we may take a to be that x,
which lies in the centre of x,, x,,...,.x,. So, we can choose a = 47.5 or a = 62.5. Let
us choose a = 47.5.

The next step is to find the difference d, between a and each of the x, s, that is,
the deviation of a from each of the x, s.

1.., d,= x,-a=x, 47.5

Reprint 2025-26

STATISTICS 175

The third step is to find the product of d, with the corresponding f,, and take the sum
of all the f,d, s. The calculations are shown in Table 13.4.

Table 13.4

4 Yfd.
So, from Table 13.4, the mean of the deviations, d = > a

Now, let us find the relation between d and X.
Since in obtaining d,, we subtracted a from each x,, so, in order to get the mean

 , we need to add a to d . This can be explained mathematically as:

Mean of deviations, d= ava

176 MATHEMATICS

Substituting the values of a, Ufd, and Xf, from Table 13.4, we get

X= 415.42 =475+145=62.

Therefore, the mean of the marks obtained by the students is 62.
The method discussed above is called the Assumed Mean Method.

Activity 1 : From the Table 13.3 find the mean by taking each of x, (i.e., 17.5, 32.5,
and so on) as a . What do you observe? You will find that the mean determined in
each case is the same, i.e., 62. (Why ?)

So, we can say that the value of the mean obtained does not depend on the
choice of a .

Observe that in Table 13.4, the values in Column 4 are all multiples of 15. So, if
we divide the values in the entire Column 4 by 15, we would get smaller numbers to
multiply with f. (Here, 15 is the class size of each class interval.)

Remark : The result obtained by all the three methods is the same. So the choice of
method to be used depends on the numerical values of x, and f. If x, and f, are
sufficiently small, then the direct method is an appropriate choice. If x, and f, are
numerically large numbers, then we can go for the assumed mean method or
step-deviation method. If the class sizes are unequal, and x, are large numerically, we
can still apply the step-deviation method by taking / to be a suitable divisor of all the d, s.

13.3. Mode of Grouped Data

Recall from Class IX, a mode is that value among the observations which occurs most
often, that is, the value of the observation having the maximum frequency. Further, we
discussed finding the mode of ungrouped data. Here, we shall discuss ways of obtaining
a mode of grouped data. It is possible that more than one value may have the same
maximum frequency. In such situations, the data is said to be multimodal. Though
grouped data can also be multimodal, we shall restrict ourselves to problems having a
single mode only.

Let us first recall how we found the mode for ungrouped data through the following
example.

Example 4 : The wickets taken by a bowler in 10 cricket matches are as follows:
2 6 4 5 0 2 1 3 2 3
Find the mode of the data.

Solution : Let us form the frequency distribution table of the given data as follows:

Reprint 2025-26

184 MATHEMATICS

Clearly, 2 is the number of wickets taken by the bowler in the maximum number
(i.e., 3) of matches. So, the mode of this data is 2.

In a grouped frequency distribution, it is not possible to determine the mode by
looking at the frequencies. Here, we can only locate a class with the maximum
frequency, called the modal class. The mode is a value inside the modal class, and is
given by the formula:

Mode = {Aah )ss
2f S 07 Sf: 2
where /= lower limit of the modal class,
h = size of the class interval (assuming all class sizes to be equal),
J, = frequency of the modal class,
J, = frequency of the class preceding the modal class,
J, = frequency of the class succeeding the modal class.
Let us consider the following examples to illustrate the use of this formula.
Example 5: A survey conducted on 20 households in a locality by a group of students

resulted in the following frequency table for the number of family members in a
household:

Find the mode of this data.

Solution : Here the maximum class frequency is 8, and the class corresponding to this
frequency is 3 5. So, the modal class is 3 5.

Now
modal class = 3 5, lower limit (/) of modal class = 3, class size (h) = 2
frequency (/,) of the modal class = 8,
frequency (f,) of class preceding the modal class = 7,
frequency (f,) of class succeeding the modal class = 2.

Now, let us substitute these values in the formula :

Reprint 2025-26

STATISTICS 185

Mode = 1+ f= to J

2hi- fo fy

= 34+ 8-7 x 2=347=3.286
2x8-7-2 7

Therefore, the mode of the data above is 3.286.

Example 6 : The marks distribution of 30 students in a mathematics examination are
given in Table 13.3 of Example 1. Find the mode of this data. Also compare and
interpret the mode and the mean.

Solution : Refer to Table 13.3 of Example 1. Since the maximum number of students
(i.e., 7) have got marks in the interval 40 - 55, the modal class is 40 - 55. Therefore,

the lower limit (/) of the modal class = 40,

the class size (A) = 15,

the frequency (f,) of modal class = 7,

the frequency (f,) of the class preceding the modal class = 3,
the frequency (f,) of the class succeeding the modal class = 6.

Now, using the formula:

Mode = (oh Joa,

7-3
14-6-3

we get Mode = son }. 15 =52

So, the mode marks is 52.
Now, from Example 1, you know that the mean marks is 62.

So, the maximum number of students obtained 52 marks, while on an average a
student obtained 62 marks.

Remarks :

1. In Example 6, the mode is less than the mean. But for some other problems it may
be equal or more than the mean also.

2. It depends upon the demand of the situation whether we are interested in finding the
average marks obtained by the students or the average of the marks obtained by most

the mode is required.

Activity 3 : Continuing with the same groups as formed in Activity 2 and the situations

compare this with the mean, and interpret the meaning of both.

Remark : The mode can also be calculated for grouped data with unequal class sizes.
However, we shall not be discussing it.

13.4 Median of Grouped Data

As you have studied in Class IX, the median is a measure of central tendency which
gives the value of the middle-most observation in the data. Recall that for finding the
median of ungrouped data, we first arrange the data values of the observations in

n+1
ascending order. Then, if 7 is odd, the median is the ae) th observation. And, ifn

is even, then the median will be the average of the sth and the [s + 7 th observations.

Suppose, we have to find the median of the following data, which gives the
marks, out of 50, obtained by 100 students in a test :

First, we arrange the marks in ascending order and prepare a frequency table as
follows:

Table 13.9

Reprint 2025-26

Here 1 = 100, which is even. The median will be the average of the 5th and the

G + i observations, i.e., the 50th and 5lst observations. To find these

observations, we proceed as follows:
Table 13.10

Marks obtained Number of students
6 + 20 = 26
26 + 24=50
50+ 28=78
78 + 15=93
93 ++4=97
97+2=99
99+ 1=100

Now we add another column depicting this information to the frequency table
above and name it as cumulative frequency column.

Remark : The part of Table 13.11 consisting Column | and Column 3 is known as
Cumulative Frequency Table. The median marks 28.5 conveys the information that
about 50% students obtained marks less than 28.5 and another 50% students obtained
marks more than 28.5.

Now, let us see how to obtain the median of grouped data, through the following
situation.

Consider a grouped frequency distribution of marks obtained, out of 100, by 53
students, in a certain examination, as follows:

Table 13.12

From the table above, try to answer the following questions:

How many students have scored marks less than 10? The answer is clearly 5.

Reprint 2025-26

STATISTICS 191

How many students have scored less than 20 marks? Observe that the number
of students who have scored less than 20 include the number of students who have
scored marks from 0 - 10 as well as the number of students who have scored marks
from 10 - 20. So, the total number of students with marks less than 20 is 5 + 3, i.e., 8.
We say that the cumulative frequency of the class 10-20 is 8.

Similarly, we can compute the cumulative frequencies of the other classes, i.e.,
the number of students with marks less than 30, less than 40, . . ., less than 100. We
give them in Table 13.13 given below:

Table 13.13

The distribution given above is called the cumulative frequency distribution of
the less than type. Here 10, 20, 30, .. . 100, are the upper limits of the respective
class intervals.

We can similarly make the table for the number of students with scores, more
than or equal to 0, more than or equal to 10, more than or equal to 20, and so on. From
Table 13.12, we observe that all 53 students have scored marks more than or equal to
0. Since there are 5 students scoring marks in the interval 0 - 10, this means that there
are 53 5 = 48 students getting more than or equal to 10 marks. Continuing in the
same manner, we get the number of students scoring 20 or above as 48 3 = 45, 30 or
above as 45 4 = 41, and so on, as shown in Table 13.14.

The table above is called a cumulative frequency distribution of the more
than type. Here 0, 10, 20, . . ., 90 give the lower limits of the respective class intervals.

Now, to find the median of grouped data, we can make use of any of these
cumulative frequency distributions.

Let us combine Tables 13.12 and 13.13 to get Table 13.15 given below:

the whole distribution into two halves. But which class should this be?

To find this class, we find the cumulative frequencies of all the classes and

Therefore, 60 70 is the median class.

Substituting the values on. 26.5, 1= 60, cf = 22, f=7, h= 10

So, about half the students have scored marks less than 66.4, and the other half have
scored marks more than 66.4.

Find the median height.

To calculate the median height, we need to find the class intervals and their
corresponding frequencies.

The given distribution being of the /ess than type, 140, 145, 150,..., 165 give the
upper limits of the corresponding class intervals. So, the classes should be below 140,
140 - 145, 145 - 150, .. ., 160. - 165. Observe that from the given distribution, we find
that there are 4 girls with height less than 140, 1.e., the frequency of class interval
below 140 is 4. Now, there are 11 girls with heights less than 145 and 4 girls with
height less than 140. Therefore, the number of girls with height in the interval
140 - 145 is 11 -4 = 7. Similarly, the frequency of 145 - 150 is 29 11 = 18, for
150 - 155, it is 40 29 = 11, and so on. So, our frequency distribution table with the
given cumulative frequencies becomes:

n_ 51 . oa.
Now n=51.So, ae 25.5. This observation lies in the class 145 - 150. Then,

1 (the lower limit) = 145,
cf (the cumulative frequency of the class preceding 145 - 150) = 11,
f (the frequency of the median class 145 - 150) = 18,

h (the class size) = 5.

 - cf

Using the formula, Median = / + xh, we have

Median = 145+ (A *) x5

145 Ca 149.03
= +g = 149.03.

So, the median height of the girls is 149.03 cm.

This means that the height of about 50% of the girls is less than this height, and
50% are taller than this height.

Solution :

It is given that n = 100

So, 76+x+y=100, ie, x+y=24 (1)
The median is 525, which lies in the class 500 600

So, /=500, f=20, cf=36+x, h=100

ne cf
Using the formula : Median = / + h, we get

525 = 500+( 22 = 3 =* |x 100
Le., 525 500 = (14 x) x 5
Le., 25 = 70 5x

Le., 5x = 70-25 =45
So, x=9

Therefore, from (1), we get 9+y= 24

Now, that you have studied about all the three measures of central tendency, let
us discuss which measure would be best suited for a particular requirement.

The mean is the most frequently used measure of central tendency because it
takes into account all the observations, and lies between the extremes, 1.e., the largest
and the smallest observations of the entire data. It also enables us to compare two or
more distributions. For example, by comparing the average (mean) results of students
of different schools of a particular examination, we can conclude which school has a

better performance.

However, extreme values in the data affect the mean. For example, the mean of
classes having frequencies more or less the same is a good representative of the data.
But, if one class has frequency, say 2, and the five others have frequency 20, 25, 20,
21, 18, then the mean will certainly not reflect the way the data behaves. So, in such
cases, the mean is not a good representative of the data.

In problems where individual observations are not important, and we wish to find
out a typical observation, the median is more appropriate, e.g., finding the typical
productivity rate of workers, average wage in a country, etc. These are situations
where extreme values may be there. So, rather than the mean, we take the median as

a better measure of central tendency.

In situations which require establishing the most frequent value or most popular
item, the mode is the best choice, e.g., to find the most popular T. V. programme being
watched, the consumer item in greatest demand, the colour of the vehicle used by
most of the people, etc.

Remarks :

1. There is a empirical relationship between the three measures of central tendency :
3 Median = Mode + 2 Mean

2. The median of grouped data with unequal class sizes can also be calculated. However,
we Shall not discuss it here.

(Hint : The data needs to be converted to continuous classes for finding the median,
since the formula assumes continuous classes. The classes then change to
117.5 - 126.5, 126.5 - 135.5, ..., 171.5 - 180.5.)

A NOTE TO THE READER

For calculating mode and median for grouped data, it should be

ensured that the class intervals are continuous before applying the
formulae. Same condition also apply for construction of an ogive.
Further, in case of ogives, the scale may not be the same on both the axes.
