2.1 Introduction

In Class IX, you have studied polynomials in one variable and their degrees. Recall
that if p(x) is a polynomial in x, the highest power of x in p(x) 1s called the degree of
the polynomial p(x). For example, 4x + 2 is a polynomial in the variable x of

degree 1, 2y? 3y + 4 is a polynomial in the variable y of degree 2, 5x? 4x? + x /2
is a polynomial in the variable x of degree 3 and 7u oJ + 4u +u-8 isa polynomial
5 Vx +2, > ete., are

in the variable u of degree 6. Expressions like
x-1 x7 +2x+3

not polynomials.

A polynomial of degree | is called a linear polynomial. For example, 2x 3,

V3x + 5, yt J2,x- =, 3z+4, Su +1,etc., are all linear polynomials. Polynomials

such as 2x + 5 x?,x + 1, etc., are not linear polynomials.

A polynomial of degree 2 is called a quadratic polynomial. The name quadratic 

has been derived from the word quadrate , which means square . 2x7 + 3x =

y? 2, 2-x7+ Bx, =F 2u? +5, J5v? -y, 47? +e are some examples of

quadratic polynomials (whose coefficients are real numbers). More generally, any
quadratic polynomial in x is of the form ax? + bx +c, where a, b, c are real numbers
and a # 0. A polynomial of degree 3 is called a cubic polynomial. Some examples of

POLYNOMIALS 11

a cubic polynomial are 2 x7, x , /2x , 3-1? + x3, 3x 2x? + x 1. In fact, the most
general form of a cubic polynomial is

ax? + bx? + cx + d,
where, a, b, c, d are real numbers and a # 0.

Now consider the polynomial p(x) = x 3x 4. Then, putting x = 2 in the
polynomial, we get p(2) = 2-3 x 2-4 =- 6. The value 6 , obtained by replacing
x by 2 in x 3x 4, is the value of x* 3x 4 at x = 2. Similarly, p(0) is the value of
P(x) at x = 0, which is 4.

If p(x) is a polynomial in x, and ifk is any real number, then the value obtained by
replacing x by k in p(x), is called the value of p(x) at x = k, and is denoted by p(A).

What is the value of p(x) = x? -3x 4 at x = 1? We have :
p(-l) = (-1?-8 x (-D} -4=0
Also, note that p(4)=47-(3 x 4)-4=0.

As p(-1) = 0 and p(4) = 0, -1 and 4 are called the zeroes of the quadratic
polynomial x* 3x 4. More generally, a real number k is said to be a zero of a
polynomial p(x), if p( ) = 0.

You have already studied in Class IX, how to find the zeroes of a linear

polynomial. For example, if k is a zero of p(x) = 2x + 3, then p(k) = 0 gives us
2k+3=0,1e,k= >
In general, if k is a zero of p(x) = ax + b, then p(k) = ak+ b=0,ie., k= 7

So, the zero of the linear polynomial ax + b is mu = (Constant term)

a Coefficient of x

Thus, the zero of a linear polynomial is related to its coefficients. Does this
happen in the case of other polynomials too? For example, are the zeroes of a quadratic
polynomial also related to its coefficients?

In this chapter, we will try to answer these questions. We will also study the
division algorithm for polynomials.

2.2 Geometrical Meaning of the Zeroes of a Polynomial

You know that a real number k is a zero of the polynomial p(x) if p(k) = 0. But why
are the zeroes of a polynomial so important? To answer this, first we will see the
geometrical representations of linear and quadratic polynomials and the geometrical
meaning of their zeroes.

12 MATHEMATICS

Consider first a linear polynomial ax + b, a # 0. You have studied in Class IX that the
graph of y = ax + b isa straight line. For example, the graph of y = 2x + 3 is a straight
line passing through the points ( 2, 1) and (2, 7).

From Fig. 2.1, you can see
that the graph of y = 2x + 3

intersects the x-axis mid-way

between x = 1 and x = 2,

that is, at the point [-3. 0),

You also know that the zero of

2x + 3 is ->. Thus, the zero of

the polynomial 2x + 3 is the

x-coordinate of the point where the
graph of y = 2x + 3 intersects the Fig. 2.1

X-axis.

In general, for a linear polynomial ax + b, a #0, the graph of y= ax + bisa
straight line which intersects the x-axis at exactly one point, namely, . 0).
a

Therefore, the linear polynomial ax + b, a # 0, has exactly one zero, namely, the
x-coordinate of the point where the graph of y = ax + b intersects the x-axis.

Now, let us look for the geometrical meaning of a zero of a quadratic polynomial.
Consider the quadratic polynomial x* 3x 4. Let us see what the graph* of
y =x 3x 4 looks like. Let us list a few values of y =x? 3x 4 corresponding to

a few values for x as given in Table 2.1.

Table 2.1

If we locate the points listed
above on a graph paper and draw
the graph, it will actually look like
the one given in Fig. 2.2.

In fact, for any quadratic
polynomial ax? + bx + c,a #0, the
graph of the corresponding
equation y = ax? + bx + c has one
of the two shapes either open

upwards like \J or open

downwards like (\ depending on
whether a > 0 or a < 0. (These
curves are called parabolas.)

You can see from Table 2.1
that 1 and 4 are zeroes of the
quadratic polynomial. Also
note from Fig. 2.2 that 1 and 4
are the x-coordinates of the points
where the graph of y = x? 3x-4
intersects the x-axis. Thus, the
zeroes of the quadratic polynomial
x? 3x 4 are x-coordinates of
the points where the graph of
y = x? 3x 4 intersects the
X-axis.

Fig. 2.2

This fact is true for any quadratic polynomial, i.e., the zeroes of a quadratic
polynomial ax + bx + c,a #0, are precisely the x-coordinates of the points where the
parabola representing y = ax? + bx +c intersects the x-axis.

From our observation earlier about the shape of the graph of y = ax? + bx +c, the
following three cases can happen:

Reprint 2025-26

14 MATHEMATICS

Case (i) : Here, the graph cuts x-axis at two distinct points A and A .

The x-coordinates of A and A are the two zeroes of the quadratic polynomial
ax? + bx + c in this case (see Fig. 2.3).

(i) (ii)
Fig. 2.3
Case (ii) : Here, the graph cuts the x-axis at exactly one point, 1.e., at two coincident

points. So, the two points A and A of Case (i) coincide here to become one point A
(see Fig. 2.4).

(i) (ii)
Fig. 2.4

The x-coordinate of A is the only zero for the quadratic polynomial ax? + bx +c
in this case.

Reprint 2025-26

POLYNOMIALS 15

Case (iii) : Here, the graph is either completely above the x-axis or completely below
the x-axis. So, it does not cut the x-axis at any point (see Fig. 2.5).

(i) (ii)
Fig. 2.5

So, the quadratic polynomial ax? + bx + c has no zero in this case.

So, you can see geometrically that a quadratic polynomial can have either two
distinct zeroes or two equal zeroes (i.e., one zero), or no zero. This also means that a
polynomial of degree 2 has atmost two zeroes.

Now, what do you expect the geometrical meaning of the zeroes of a cubic
polynomial to be? Let us find out. Consider the cubic polynomial x? 4x. To see what
the graph of y =x 4x looks like, let us list a few values of y corresponding to a few
values for x as shown in Table 2.2.

Table 2.2

Locating the points of the table on a graph paper and drawing the graph, we see
that the graph of y = x 4x actually looks like the one given in Fig. 2.6.

Reprint 2025-26

We see from the table above
that 2, 0 and 2 are zeroes of the
cubic polynomial x* 4x. Observe
that 2, 0 and 2 are, in fact, the
x-coordinates of the only points

MATHEMATICS

where the graph of y = x 4x
intersects the x-axis. Since the curve
meets the x-axis in only these 3
points, their x-coordinates are the
only zeroes of the polynomial.

Let us take a few more
examples. Consider the cubic
polynomials x* and x* x*. We draw
the graphs of y = x and y=x3 x?

in Fig. 2.7 and Fig. 2.8 respectively.

Fig. 2.7

Reprint 2025-26

Fig. 2.8

POLYNOMIALS 17

Note that 0 is the only zero of the polynomial x . Also, from Fig. 2.7, you can see
that 0 is the x-coordinate of the only point where the graph of y = x? intersects the
x-axis. Similarly, since x x =x*(x 1), O and 1 are the only zeroes of the polynomial
x? x , Also, from Fig. 2.8, these values are the x-coordinates of the only points
where the graph of y = x* x intersects the x-axis.

From the examples above, we see that there are at most 3 zeroes for any cubic
polynomial. In other words, any polynomial of degree 3 can have at most three zeroes.
Remark : In general, given a polynomial p(x) of degree n, the graph of y = p(x)
intersects the x-axis at atmost 7 points. Therefore, a polynomial p(x) of degree n has
at most 1 zeroes.

Example 1 : Look at the graphs in Fig. 2.9 given below. Each is the graph of y = p(x),
where p(x) is a polynomial. For each of the graphs, find the number of zeroes of p(x).

2.3 Relationship between Zeroes and Coefficients of a Polynomial
b

You have already seen that zero of a linear polynomial ax + bis = . We will now try

a
to answer the question raised in Section 2.1 regarding the relationship between zeroes
and coefficients of a quadratic polynomial. For this, let us take a quadratic polynomial,
say p(x) = 2x? 8x + 6. In Class IX, you have learnt how to factorise quadratic
polynomials by splitting the middle term. So, here we need to split the middle term
 _ 8x as a sum of two terms, whose product is 6 x 2x? = 12x . So, we write
2x? 8x + 6 = 2x? 6x 2x + 6 = 2x(x 3) 2(x 3)
= (2x 2)(x 3) = 2(x 1) - 3)

Reprint 2025-26

POLYNOMIALS 19

So, the value of p(x) = 2x? 8x + 6 is zero when x 1 = 0 or x 3 = 0, i.e., when
x = 1 orx =3. So, the zeroes of 2x? 8x + 6 are | and 3. Observe that :

 (-8) _ (Coefficient of x)
2 Coefficient of x 
6 Constant term

Product of its zeroes = 1X3 =3= =
2 Coefficient of x?

Sum ofits zeroes = 14+3=4=

Let us take one more quadratic polynomial, say, p(x) = 3x + 5x 2. By the
method of splitting the middle term,

3x? + 5x- 2 = 3x? + 6x x 2 = 3x(x + 2) -1(x + 2)
= (3x 1)(x + 2)

Hence, the value of 3x? + 5x 2 is zero when either 3x - 1 =0 orx +2 =0, ie.,

1 1
when x = 3 or x = 2. So, the zeroes of 3x? + 5x 2 are 3 and 2. Observe that :

In general, if * and B* are the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial p(x) = ax? + bx +c,
a #0, then you know that x o and x B are the factors of p(x). Therefore,

ax* + bx + c = k(x a) (x B), where k is a constant

relationship between the zeroes and the coefficients.

Solution : We have

x + 7x + 10=(x + 2)(x + 5)
So, the value of x* + 7x + 10 is zero when x + 2=0 orx +5 =0, i.e., when x = 2 or
x =~ 5. Therefore, the zeroes of x? + 7x + 10 are 2 and 5. Now,

So, one quadratic polynomial which fits the given conditions is x? + 3x + 2.

You can check that any other quadratic polynomial that fits these conditions will
be of the form k(x? + 3x + 2), where x is real.

Let us now look at cubic polynomials. Do you think a similar relation holds
between the zeroes of a cubic polynomial and its coefficients?

Let us consider p(x) = 2x3 5x? 14x + 8.

You can check that p(x) = 0 for x = 4, 2, ; - Since p(x) can have atmost three

zeroes, these are the zeores of 2x* 5x? 14x + 8. Now,
