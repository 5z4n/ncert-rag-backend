SURFACE AREAS AND
VOLUMES

12.1 Introduction

From Class IX, you are familiar with some of the solids like cuboid, cone, cylinder, and
sphere (see Fig. 12.1). You have also learnt how to find their surface areas and volumes.

Fig. 12.1

In our day-to-day life, we come across a number of solids made up of combinations
of two or more of the basic solids as shown above.

You must have seen a truck with a
container fitted on its back (see Fig. 12.2),
carrying oil or water from one place to
another. Is it in the shape of any of the four
basic solids mentioned above? You may
guess that it is made of a cylinder with two
hemispheres as its ends.

Again, you may have seen an object like the
one in Fig. 12.3. Can you name it? A test tube, right! 3
)

You would have used one in your science laboratory.
This tube is also a combination of a cylinder and a
hemisphere. Similarly, while travelling, you may have
seen some big and beautiful buildings or monuments
made up of a combination of solids mentioned above.

If for some reason you wanted to find the
surface areas, or volumes, or capacities of such
objects, how would you do it? We cannot classify

these under any of the solids you have already studied. Fig. 12.3

In this chapter, you will see how to find surface areas and volumes of such
objects.

12.2 Surface Area of a Combination of Solids

Let us consider the container seen in Fig. 12.2. How do we find the surface area of
such a solid? Now, whenever we come across a new problem, we first try to see, if
we can break it down into smaller problems, we have earlier solved. We can see that
this solid is made up of a cylinder with two hemispheres stuck at either end. It would
look like what we have in Fig. 12.4, after we put the pieces all together.

Fig. 12.4
If we consider the surface of the newly formed object, we would be able to see
only the curved surfaces of the two hemispheres and the curved surface of the cylinder.

So, the total surface area of the new solid is the sum of the curved surface
areas of each of the individual parts. This gives,

TSA of new solid = CSA of one hemisphere + CSA of cylinder
+ CSA of other hemisphere

where TSA, CSA stand for Total Surface Area and Curved Surface Area 
respectively.

Let us now consider another situation. Suppose we are making a toy by putting
together a hemisphere and a cone. Let us see the steps that we would be going
through.

SURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES 163

First, we would take a cone and a hemisphere and bring their flat faces together.
Here, of course, we would take the base radius of the cone equal to the radius of the
hemisphere, for the toy is to have a smooth surface. So, the steps would be as shown
in Fig. 12.5.
= fF =

Fig. 12.5

At the end of our trial, we have got ourselves a nice round-bottomed toy. Now if
we want to find how much paint we would require to colour the surface of this toy,
what would we need to know? We would need to know the surface area of the toy,
which consists of the CSA of the hemisphere and the CSA of the cone.

So, we can say:
Total surface area of the toy = CSA of hemisphere + CSA of cone

Now, let us consider some examples.

Example 1 : Rasheed gota playing top (/attu) as his
birthday present, which surprisingly had no colour on
it. He wanted to colour it with his crayons. The top is
shaped like a cone surmounted by a hemisphere
(see Fig 12.6). The entire top is 5 cm in height and
the diameter of the top is 3.5 cm. Find the area he

Fig. 12.6
has to colour. (Take m = >)

Solution : This top is exactly like the object we have discussed in Fig. 12.5. So, we
can conveniently use the result we have arrived at there. That is :

TSA of the toy = CSA of hemisphere + CSA of cone

Now, the curved surface area of the hemisphere = 5 (ane ) = 2mr

Also, the height of the cone = height of the top height (radius) of the hemispherical part

/ 3.5
So, the slant height of the cone (/ )= rth = 3) + (3.25)? cm =3.7 cm (approx.)

Therefore, CSA of cone = mr/ = 7% 5 x 3.7

This gives the surface area of the top as

= 7% = (3.5 + 3.7) cm* = 3% (3.5 + 3.7) cm* = 39.6 cm? (approx.)
You may note that total surface area of the top is not the sum of the total
surface areas of the cone and hemisphere. 4.2. em

Example 2 : The decorative block shown
in Fig. 12.7 is made of two solids a cube
and a hemisphere. The base of the block is a
cube with edge 5 cm, and the hemisphere
fixed on the top has a diameter of 4.2 cm.

Solution : The total surface area of the cube = 6 x (edge)? = 6 x 5 x 5 cm = 150 cm .

Note that the part of the cube where the hemisphere is attached is not included in the
surface area.

So, the surface area of the block = TSA of cube base area of hemisphere

Example 3 : A wooden toy rocket is in the
shape of a cone mounted on a cylinder, as
shown in Fig. 12.8. The height of the entire
rocket is 26 cm, while the height of the conical
part is 6 cm. The base of the conical portion
has a diameter of 5 cm, while the base
diameter of the cylindrical portion is 3 cm. If
the conical portion is to be painted orange

Here, the conical portion has its circular base resting on the base of the cylinder, but
the base of the cone is larger than the base of the cylinder. So, a part of the base of the

12.3. Volume of a Combination of Solids Fig. 12.11

In the previous section, we have discussed how to find the surface area of solids made
up of a combination of two basic solids. Here, we shall see how to calculate their
volumes. It may be noted that in calculating the surface area, we have not added the
surface areas of the two constituents, because some part of the surface area disappeared
in the process of joining them. However, this will not be the case when we calculate
the volume. The volume of the solid formed by joining two basic solids will actually be
the sum of the volumes of the constituents, as we see in the examples below.

Example 5 : Shanta runs an industry in
a shed which is in the shape of a cuboid
surmounted by a half cylinder (see Fig.
12.12). If the base of the shed is of
dimension 7 m x 15 m, and the height of
the cuboidal portion is 8 m, find the volume
of air that the shed can hold. Further,
suppose the machinery in the shed
occupies a total space of 300 m*, and
there are 20 workers, each of whom
occupy about 0.08 m? space on an
average. Then, how much air is in the
shed? (Take 1 = 7)

Reprint 2025-26

168 MATHEMATICS

Solution : The volume of air inside the shed (when there are no people or machinery)
is given by the volume of air inside the cuboid and inside the half cylinder, taken
together.

Now, the length, breadth and height of the cuboid are 15m, 7 mand 8 m, respectively.
Also, the diameter of the half cylinder is 7 m and its height is 15 m.
So, the required volume = volume of the cuboid + 5 volume of the cylinder

= isx7xstixmxty txts m> = 1128.75 m3
2 7 22

Next, the total space occupied by the machinery = 300 m?
And the total space occupied by the workers = 20 x 0.08 m* = 1.6 m?
Therefore, the volume of the air, when there are machinery and workers

= 1128.75 (300.00 + 1.60) = 827.15 m?

Example 6 : A juice seller was serving his
customers using glasses as shown in Fig. 12.13.
The inner diameter of the cylindrical glass was
5 cm, but the bottom of the glass had a
hemispherical raised portion which reduced the
capacity of the glass. If the height of a glass
was 10 cm, find the apparent capacity of the
glass and its actual capacity. (Use m = 3.14.) Fig. 12.13

Solution : Since the inner diameter of the glass = 5 cm and height = 10 cm,
the apparent capacity of the glass = mr7h
= 3.14 2.5 x 2.5 x 10 cm = 196.25 cm?

But the actual capacity of the glass is less by the volume of the hemisphere at the
base of the glass.

2 2
ie., it is less by 3 Tr = 3 x 3.14. 2.52.5 x 2.5 cm? = 32.71 om?
So, the actual capacity of the glass = apparent capacity of glass volume of the
hemisphere

hemisphere surmounted by a right circular cone. The
height of the cone is 2 cm and the diameter of the
base is 4 cm. Determine the volume of the toy. Ifa
right circular cylinder circumscribes the toy, find the
difference of the volumes of the cylinder and the toy.
(Take m = 3.14) Fig. 12.14

Solution : Let BPC be the hemisphere and ABC be the cone standing on the base
of the hemisphere (see Fig. 12.14). The radius BO of the hemisphere (as well as

of the cone) = 5 x 4em=2 cm.

Now, let the right circular cylinder EFGH circumscribe the given solid. The radius of
the base of the right circular cylinder = HP = BO = 2 cm, and its height is
EH = AO + OP =(2+ 2) cm=4cm
So, the volume required = volume of the right circular cylinder volume of the toy
= (3.14 x 2? x 4 25.12) cm?
= 25.12 cm?

Hence, the required difference of the two volumes = 25.12 cm .
