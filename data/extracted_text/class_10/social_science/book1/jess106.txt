MANUFACTUKING INVUSTKIES

@
On the occassion of Diwali, Harish went to
a market with his parents. They purchased
shoes and clothes for him. His mother
purchased utensils, sugar, tea and diyas
(earthen lamps). Harish observed that the
shops in the market were flooded with
items for sale. He wondered how so many
items could be made in such large
quantities. His father explained that shoes,
clothes, sugar etc. are manufactured by
machines in large industries, some utensils
are manufactured in small industries, while
items like diyas are made by individual
artisans in household industry.

Do you have some ideas about these
industries?

Production of goods in large quantities after
processing from raw materials to more
valuable products is called manufacturing. Do
you know that paper is manufactured from
wood, sugar from sugarcane, iron and steel
from iron ore and aluminium from bauxite?
Do you also know that some types of clothes
are manufactured from yarn which itself is an
industrial product?

People employed in the secondary activities
manufacture the primary materials into
finished goods. The workers employed in steel
factories, car, breweries, textile industries,
bakeries etc. fall into this category. Some people
are employed in providing services. In this
chapter, we are mainly concerned with
manufacturing industries which fall in the
secondary sector.

The economic strength of a country is
measured by the development of
manufacturing industries.

IMPORTANCE OF MANUFACTURING

Manufacturing sector is considered the backbone
of development in general and economic
development in particular mainly because- 

e Manufacturing industries not only help in
modernising agriculture, which forms the
backbone of our economy, they also reduce
the heavy dependence of people on
agricultural income by providing them jobs
in secondary and tertiary sectors.

 Industrial development is a precondition for
eradication of unemployment and poverty
from our country. This was the main
philosophy behind public sector industries
and joint sector ventures in India. It was also
aimed at bringing down regional disparities
by establishing industries in tribal and
backward areas.

e Export of manufactured goods expands
trade and commerce, and brings in much
needed foreign exchange.

 Countries that transform their raw
materials into a wide variety of finished
goods of higher value are prosperous.
India s prosperity lies in increasing and
diversifying its manufacturing industries as
quickly as possible.

Agriculture and industry are not exclusive
of each other. They move hand in hand. For
instance, the agro-industries in India have
given a major boost to agriculture by raising
its productivity. They depend on the latter for
raw materials and sell their products such as
irrigation pumps, fertilisers, insecticides,
pesticides, plastic and PVC pipes, machines
and tools, etc. to the farmers. Thus,
development and competitiveness of

Reprint 2025-26

manufacturing industry has not only
assisted agriculturists in increasing their
production but also made the production
processes very efficient.

In the present day world of globalisation,
our industry needs to be more efficient and
competitive. Self-sufficiency alone is not
enough. Our manufactured goods must be
at par in quality with those in the
international market. Only then, will we be
able to compete in the international market.

Classification of Industries

List the various manufactured products you
use in your daily life such as transistors,
electric bulbs, vegetable oil, cement,
glassware, petrol, matches, scooters,
automobiles, medicines and so on. If we
classify the various industries based on a
particular criterion then we would be
able to understand their manufacturing
better. Industries may be classified as
follows:

On the basis of source of raw materials
used:

 Agro based: cotton, woollen, jute, silk
textile, rubber and sugar, tea, coffee,
edible oil.

 Mineral based: iron and steel, cement,
aluminium, machine tools,
petrochemicals.

According to their main role:

 Basic or key industries are those which
supply their products as raw materials to
manufacture other goods e.g. iron and
steel and copper smelting, aluminum
smelting.

 Consumer industries that produce goods
for direct use by consumers sugar,
toothpaste, paper, sewing machines,
fans etc.

On the basis of capital investment:

 A small scale industry is defined with
reference to the maximum investment

allowed on the assets of a unit. This limit
has changed over a period of time. At
present the maximum investment allowed
is rupees one crore.

On the basis of ownership:

 Public sector, owned and operated by
government agencies BHEL, SAIL etc.

 Private sector industries owned and
operated by individuals or a group of
individuals -TISCO, Bajaj Auto Ltd.,
Dabur Industries.

Joint sector industries which are jointly run
by the state and individuals or a group of
individuals. Oil India Ltd. (OIL) is jointly
owned by public and private sector.

* Cooperative sector industries are owned
and operated by the producers or
suppliers of raw materials, workers or
both. They pool in the resources and share
the profits or losses proportionately. Such
examples are the sugar industry in
Maharashtra, the coir industry in Kerala.

Based on the bulk and weight of raw material
and finished goods:

 Heavy industries such as iron and steel

e Light industries that use light raw
materials and produce light goods such
as electrical goods industries.

Activity
Classify the following into two groups on the
basis of bulk and weight of raw material and
finished goods.

(i) Oil

(ii) Knitting needles

(vi) Sewing Machines
(vii) Shipbuilding
(viii) Electric Bulbs

(ix) Paint brushes

(iii) Brassware

Textile Industry: The textile industry
occupies unique position in the Indian
economy, because it contributes significantly
to industrial production, employment
generation and foreign exchange earnings. It
is the only industry in the country, which is
self-reliant and complete in the value chain
i.e., from raw material to the highest value
added products.

Cotton Textiles: In ancient India, cotton
textiles were produced with hand spinning
and handloom weaving techniques. After
the 18" century, power-looms came into
use. Our traditional industries suffered a
setback during the colonial period because
they could not compete with the mill-made
cloth from England.

 The first successful textile mill was (

established in Mumbai in 1854.

 The two world wars were fought in Europe,

India was a British colony. There was a

e demand for cloth in U.K. hence, they gave

a boost to the development of the cotton
textile industry.

In the early years, the cotton textile
industry was concentrated in the cotton
growing belt of Maharashtra and Gujarat.
Availability of raw cotton, market, transport
including accessible port facilities, labour,
moist climate, etc. contributed towards its
localisation. This industry has close links
with agriculture and provides a living to
farmers, cotton boll pluckers and workers
engaged in ginning, spinning, weaving,

/

Value addition in the textile industry

dyeing, designing, packaging, tailoring and
sewing. The industry by creating demands
supports many other industries, such as,
chemicals and dyes, packaging materials
and engineering works.

While spinning continues to be centralised
in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu,
weaving is highly decentralised to provide
scope for incorporating traditional skills and
designs of weaving in cotton, silk, zari,
embroidery, etc. India has world class
production in spinning, but weaving supplies
low quality of fabric as it cannot use much of
the high quality yarn produced in the country.
Weaving is done by handloom, powerloom and
in mills.

The handspun khadi provides large scale
employment to weavers in their homes as a
cottage industry.

Why did Mahatma Gandhi lay emphasis on
spinning yarn and weaving khadi?

Why is it important for our country to
keep the mill sector loomage lower than
power loom and handloom?

Jute Textiles

India is the largest producer of raw jute and
jute goods and stands at second place as an
exporter after Bangladesh. Most of the mills are
located in West Bengal, mainly along the banks
of the Hugli river, in a narrow belt.

The first jute mill was set up near Kolkata in
1855 at Rishra. After Partition in 1947, the
jute mills remained in India but three-fourth
of the jute producing area went to
Bangladesh (erstwhile East Pakistan).

Factors responsible for their location in the
Hugli basin are: proximity of the jute producing
areas, inexpensive water transport, supported
by a good network of railways, roadways and
waterways to facilitate movement of raw
material to the mills, abundant water for
processing raw jute, cheap labour from West
Bengal and adjoining states of Bihar, Odisha
and Uttar Pradesh. Kolkata as a large urban
centre provides banking, insurance and port
facilities for export of jute goods.

Sugar Industry

India stands second as a world producer of
sugar but occupies the first place in the
production of gur and khandsari. The raw
material used in this industry is bulky, and in
haulage its sucrose content reduces. The mills
are located in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar,
Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra
Pradesh, Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana and
Madhya Pradesh. Sixty per cent mills are in
Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. This industry is
seasonal in nature so, it is ideally suited to the
cooperative sector. Can you explain why this
is so?

In recent years, there is a tendency for the
mills to shift and concentrate in the southern
and western states, especially in Maharashtra,
This is because the cane produced here has a
higher sucrose content. The cooler climate also
ensures a longer crushing season. Moreover,
the cooperatives are more successful in these
states.

Mineral-based Industries

Industries that use minerals and metals as raw
materials are called mineral-based industries.
Can you name some industries that would fall
in this category?

Iron and Steel Industry

The iron and steel industry is the basic industry
since all the other industries heavy, medium
and light, depend on it for their machinery.
Steel is needed to manufacture a variety of
engineering goods, construction material,
defence, medical, telephonic, scientific
equipment and a variety of consumer goods.

Activity
Make a list of all such goods made of steel
that you can think of.

Production and consumption of steel is
often regarded as the index of a country s
development. Iron and steel is a heavy industry
because all the raw materials as well as
finished goods are heavy and bulky entailing
heavy transportation costs. Iron ore, coking
coal and lime stone are required in the ratio of
approximately 4 : 2: 1. Some quantities of
manganese, are also required to harden the
steel. Where should the steel plants be ideally
located? Remember that the finished products
also need an efficient transport network for
their distribution to the markets and
consumers.

Chhotanagpur plateau region has the
maximum concentration of iron and steel
industries. It is largely, because of the relative
advantages this region has for the development
of this industry. These include, low cost of iron
ore, high grade raw materials in proximity,
cheap labour and vast growth potential in the
home market.

Aluminium Smelting

Aluminium smelting is the second most
important metallurgical industry in India. Itis
light, resistant to corrosion, a good conductor of
heat, malleable and becomes strong when it is
mixed with other metals. It is used to
manufacture aircraft, utensils and wires. It has
gained popularity as a substitute of steel, copper,
zinc and lead in a number of industries.

Fig. 6.3: Strip coasting mill at smelter of NALCO

Aluminium smelting plants in the country
are located in Odisha, West Bengal, Kerala,
Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and
Tamil Nadu.

Bauxite, the raw material used in the
smelters is a very bulky, dark reddish coloured
rock. The flow chart given below shows the
process of manufacturing aluminium. Regular
supply of electricity and an assured source of
raw material at minimum cost are the two
prime factors for location of the industry.

Chemical Industries

The Chemical industry in India is fast growing
and diversifying. It comprises both large and
small scale manufacturing units. Rapid growth
has been recorded in both inorganic and
organic sectors. Inorganic chemicals include
sulphuric acid (used to manufacture fertilizers,
synthetic fibres, plastics, adhesives, paints,
dyes stuffs), nitric acid, alkalies, soda ash (used
to make glass, soaps and detergents, paper)
and caustic soda. These industries are widely
spread over the country.

Why do you think it is so?

Organic chemicals include petrochemicals,
which are used for manufacturing of synthetic
fibers, synthetic rubber, plastics, dye-stuffs,
drugs and pharmaceuticals. Organic chemical

The chemical industry is its own largest
consumer. Basic chemicals undergo processing
to further produce other chemicals that are
used for industrial application, agriculture or
directly for consumer markets. Make a list of
the products you are aware of.

Fertilizer Industry

The fertilizer industry is centred around the
production of nitrogenous fertilizers (mainly
urea), phosphatic fertilizers and ammonium
phosphate (DAP) and complex fertilizers which
have a combination of nitrogen (N), phosphate
(P), and potash (K). The third, i.e. potash is
entirely imported as the country does not have
any reserves of commercially usable potash or
potassium compounds in any form.

After the Green Revolution the industry
expanded to several other parts of the country.
Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and
Kerala contribute towards half of the fertilizer
production. Other significant producers are
Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Bihar,
Maharashtra, Assam, West Bengal, Goa, Delhi,
Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka.

Cement Industry

Cement is essential for construction activity
such as building houses, factories, bridges,
roads, airports, dams and for other commercial
establishments. This industry requires bulky
and heavy raw materials like limestone, silica
and gypsum. Coal and electric power are
needed apart from rail transportation.

Activity

Where would it be economically viable to

set up the cement manufacturing units?

The industry has strategically located

plants in Gujarat that have suitable access to
the market in the Gulf countries.

Activity
Find out where the plants are located in other
States of India. Find their names.

The first cement plant was set-up in
Chennai in 1904. After Independence the
industry expanded.

Automobile Industry

Automobiles provide vehicle for quick
transport of good services and passengers.
Trucks, buses, cars, motor cycles, scooters,
three-wheelers and multi-utility vehicles are
manufactured in India at various centres. After
the liberalisation, the coming in of new and
contemporary models stimulated the demand
for vehicles in the market, which led to the
healthy growth of the industry including
passenger cars, two and three-wheelers. The
industry is located around Delhi, Gurugram,
Mumbai, Pune, Chennai, Kolkata, Lucknow,
Indore, Hyderabad, Jamshedpur and
Bengaluru.

Information Technology and
Electronics Industry

The electronics industry covers a wide range
of products from transistor sets to television,
telephones, cellular telecom, telephone
exchange, radars, computers and many
other equipments required by the
telecommunication industry. Bengaluru has
emerged as the electronic capital of India. Other
important centres for electronic goods are
Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Pune, Chennai,
Kolkata, Lucknow and Coimbatore. The major
industry concentration is at Bengaluru, Noida,
Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad and Pune. A
major impact of this industry has been on
employment generation. The continuing
growth in the hardware and software is the key
to the success of IT industry in India.

Industrial Pollution and Environmental
Degradation

Although industries contribute significantly to
India s economic growth and development, the
increase in pollution of land, water, air, noise
and resulting degradation of environment that
they have caused, cannot be overlooked.
Industries are responsible for four types of
pollution: (a) Air (b) Water (c) Land (d) Noise.
The polluting industries also include thermal
power plants.

Air pollution is caused by the presence of high
proportion of undesirable gases, such as
sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide. Airborne particulate materials contain both solid
and liquid particles like dust, sprays mist and
smoke. Smoke is emitted by chemical and
paper factories, brick kilns, refineries and
smelting plants, and burning of fossil fuels in
big and small factories that ignore pollution
norms. Toxic gas leaks can be very hazardous
with long-term effects. Are you aware of the
Bhopal Gas tragedy that occurred? Air
pollution adversely affects human health,
animals, plants, buildings and the atmosphere
as a whole.

Water pollution is caused by organic and
inorganic industrial wastes and affluents
discharged into rivers. The main culprits in this
regard are paper, pulp, chemical, textile and
dyeing, petroleum refineries, tanneries and
electroplating industries that let out dyes,
detergents, acids, salts and heavy metals like
lead and mercury pesticides, fertilisers,
synthetic chemicals with carbon, plastics and
rubber, etc. into the water bodies. Fly ash,
phospo- gypsum and iron and steel slags are
the major solid wastes in India.

Thermal pollution of water occurs when hot
water from factories and thermal plants is
drained into rivers and ponds before cooling.
What would be the effect on aquatic life?
Wastes from nuclear power plants, nuclear
and weapon production facilities cause
cancers, birth defects and miscarriages. Soil
and water pollution are closely related.

Dumping of wastes specially glass, harmful
chemicals, industrial effluents, packaging, salts
and garbage renders the soil useless. Rain
water percolates to the soil carrying the
pollutants to the ground and the ground water
also gets contaminated.

Noise pollution not only results in irritation
and anger, it can also cause hearing
impairment, increased heart rate and blood
pressure among other physiological effects.
Unwanted sound is an irritant and a source of
stress. Industrial and construction activities,
machinery, factory equipment, generators,
saws and pneumatic and electric drills also
make a lot of noise.

Control of Environmental Degradation

Every litre of waste water discharged by our
industry pollutes eight times the quantity of
freshwater. How can the industrial pollution of
fresh water be reduced? Some suggestions are(i) minimising use water for processing by
reusing and recycling it in two or more
successive stages

(ii) harvesting of rainwater to meet water
requirements

(iii) treating hot water and effluents before
releasing them in rivers and ponds.
Treatment of industrial effluents can be
done in three phases

(a) Primary treatment by mechanical means.
This involves screening, grinding,
flocculation and sedimentation.

(b) Secondary treatment by biological process

(c) Tertiary treatment by biological,
chemical and physical processes. This
involves recycling of wastewater.

Overdrawing of ground water reserves by

industry where there is a threat to ground
water resources also needs to be regulated
legally. Particulate matter in the air can be
reduced by fitting smoke stacks to factories
with electrostatic precipitators, fabric filters,
scrubbers and inertial separators. Smoke
can be reduced by using oil or gas instead
