NOTES FOR THE TEACHER

CHAPTER | : DEVELOPMENT

Development has many aspects. The
purpose of this chapter is to enable
students to understand this idea. They
have to understand that people have
different perspectives on development and
there are ways by which we can arrive at
common indicators for development. To
do this, we have used situations that they
can respond to in an intuitive manner; we
have also presented analysis that is more
complex and macro in nature.

How can countries or states be
compared using some _ selected
development indicators is another
question that students would read
about in this chapter. Economic
development can be measured and
income is the most common method
for measuring development. However,
the income method, though useful,
has several weaknesses. Hence, we
need newer ways of looking at
development using indicators of
quality of life and environmental
sustainability.

It is necessary for you to expect the
students to respond actively in the
classroom and on a topic such as the
above, there would be wide variation in
opinion and possibility of debate. Allow
students to argue their point of view. At
the end of each section there are a few
questions and activities. These serve two
purposes: first, they recap the ideas
discussed in the section and second, they

enable better understanding of the themes
discussed by bringing the learners closer
to their real life situations.

There are certain terms used in this
chapter that would require clarification 
Per Capita Income, Literacy Rate, Infant
Mortality Rate, Attendance Ratio, Life
Expectancy, Gross Enrolment Ratio, and
Human Development Index. Though data
pertaining to these terms are provided,
these would need further explanation. You
may also need to clarify the concept of
Purchasing Power Parity that is used to
calculate Gross National Income per capita
in Table 1.6. Itis necessary to keep in mind
that these terms are used as an aid to the
discussion and not something to be
memorised.

Sources for Information

The data for this chapter is taken from
reports published by the Government of
India (Economic Survey, Reports of the
National Family Health Survey and
Handbook of Statistics on the Indian
Economy), United Nations Development
Programme (Human Development Report)
and World Bank (World Development
Indicators). Many of these reports are
published every year. It may be interesting
to look up these reports if they are
available in your school library. If not, you
may log on to the websites of these
institutions (www.budgetindia.nic.in,

The idea of development or progress Tid iIiiti is
has always been with us. We have
aspirations or desires about what we
would like to do and how we would
like to live. Similarly, we have ideas
about what a country should be like.
What are the essential things that we
require? Can life be better for all? How
should people live together? Can there
be more equality? Development
involves thinking about these
questions and about the ways in
which we can work towards achieving
these goals. This is a complex
task and in this chapter we shall
make a beginning at understanding
development. You will learn more
about these issues in greater depth
in higher classes. Also, you will find
answers to many of these questions
not just in economics but also in your
course in history and political science.

WHAT DEVELOPMENT PROMISES 
DIFFERENT PEOPLE, DIFFERENT GOALS

YOU WANT A CAR? THE WAY OUR COUNTRY IS
SET UP ALL YOU CAN HOPE FOR IS MAY BE TO
ONE DAY OWN THE RICKSHAW YOU FULL!

Let us try to imagine what
development or progress is likely to
mean to different persons listed in
Table 1.1. What are their aspirations?
You will find that some columns are
partially filled. Try to complete the
table. You can also add any other
category of persons.

which are conflicting. A girl expects
as much freedom and opportunity as
her brother, and that he also shares
in the household work. Her brother
may not like this. Similarly, to get
more electricity, industrialists may
want more dams. But this may
submerge the land and disrupt the
lives of people who are displaced such
as tribals. They might resent this and
may prefer small check dams or tanks
to irrigate their land.

So, two things are quite clear: one,
different persons can have
different developmental goals and
two, what may be development for
one may not be development for
the other. It may even be
destructive for the other.

INCOME AND OTHER GOALS

If you go over Table 1.1 again, you
will notice one common thing: what
people desire are regular work, better
wages, and decent price for their crops
or other products that they produce.
In other words, they want more
income.

Besides seeking more income, oneway or the other, people also seek
things like equal treatment, freedom,
security, and respect of others. They
resent discrimination. All these are
important goals. In fact, in some cases,
these may be more important than

more income or more consumption
because material goods are not all
that you need to live.

Money, or material things that one
can buy with it, is one factor on which
our life depends. But the quality of our
life also depends on non-material
things mentioned above. If it is not
obvious to you, then just think of the
role of your friends in your life. You
may desire their friendship. Similarly,
there are many things that are not
easily measured but they mean a lot
to our lives. These are often ignored.

THOSE PEOPLE
DON T WANT TO
DEVELOF!

A demonstration

meeting against

of Sardar
Sarovar Dam on

Narmada River

However, it will be wrong to conclude
that what cannot be measured is not
important.

Consider another example. If you
get a job in a far off place, before
accepting it you would try to consider
many factors, apart from income,
such as facilities for your family,
working atmosphere, or opportunity
to learn. In another case, a job may
give you less pay but may offer regular
employment that enhances your
sense of security. Another job,
however, may offer high pay but no
job security and also leave no time for
your family. This will reduce your
sense of security and freedom.

Similarly, for development,
people look at a mix of goals. It is
true that ifwomen are engaged in paid
work, their dignity in the household
and society increases. However, it is
also the case that if there is respect
for women there would be more
sharing of housework and a
greater acceptance of women
working outside. A safe and secure
environment may allow more women
to take up a variety of jobs or run
a business.

Hence, the developmental goals
that people have are not only about
better income but also about other
important things in life.

LET S WORK THESE OUT

1. Why do different persons have different notions of development? Which of the following
explanations is more important and why?

(a) | Because people are different.
(0) Because life situations of persons are different.

2. Do the following two statements mean the same? Justify your answer.
(a) | People have different developmental goals.
(bo) | People have conflicting developmental goals.

3. Give some examples where factors other than income are important aspects of our lives.

4. Explain some of the important ideas of the above section in your own words.

NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT

If, as we have seen above, individuals
seek different goals, then their notion
of national development is also likely
to be different. Discuss among
yourselves on what India should do
for development.

Most likely, you would find that
different students in the class have given
different answers to the above question.
In fact, you might yourself think of
many different answers and not be too
sure of any of these. It is very
important to keep in mind that

Reprint 2025-26

different persons could have
different as well as conflicting
notions of a country s development.

However, can all the ideas be
considered equally important? Or, if
there are conflicts how does one
decide? What would be a fair and just
path for all? We also have to think
whether there is a better way of doing
things. Would the idea benefit a large
number of people or only a small
group? National development means
thinking about these questions.

HOW TO COMPARE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES

OR STATES?

You might ask if development can
mean different things, how come some
countries are generally called
developed and others underdeveloped? Before we come to this,
let us consider another question.

When we compare different things,
they could have similarities as well as
differences. Which aspects do we use
to compare them? Let us look at
students in the class itself. How do
we compare different students? They
differ in their height, health, talents
and interests. The healthiest student
may not be the most studious one.
The most intelligent student may not
be the friendliest one. So, how do we
compare students? The criterion we
may use depends on the purpose of
comparison. We use different criterion
to choose a sports team, a debate
team, a music team or a team to
organise a picnic. Still, if for some
purpose, we have to choose the
criterion for the all-round progress of
children in the class, how shall we
do it?

Usually we take one or more
important characteristics of
persons and compare them based
on these characteristics. Of
course, there can be differences about
what are important characteristics
that should form the basis of
comparison: friendliness and spirit of
cooperation, creativity or marks
secured?

This is true of development too.
For comparing countries, their
income is considered to be one of
the most important attributes.
Countries with higher income are

Reprint 2025-26

more developed than others with less
income. This is based on the
understanding that more income
means more of all things that human
beings need. Whatever people like,
and should have, they will be able to
get with greater income. So, greater
income itself is considered to be one
important goal.

Now, what is the income of a
country? Intuitively, the income of the
country is the income of all the
residents of the country. This gives
us the total income of the country.

However, for comparison between
countries, total income is not such an
useful measure. Since, countries have
different populations, comparing total
income will not tell us what an average
person is likely to earn. Are people in
one country better off than others ina
different country? Hence, we compare
the average income which is the total
income of the country divided by its
total population. The average income
is also called per capita income.

In World Development Reports,
brought out by the World Bank, this
criterion is used in classifying
countries. Countries with per capita
income of US$ 63,400 per annum
and above in 2023, are called high
income or rich countries and those
with per capita income of about
US$ 2400 or less are called
low-income countries. India comes
in the category of low middle income
countries because its per capita
income in 2023 was just about
US$ 10030 per annum. The rich
countries, excluding countries of
Middle East and certain other small
countries, are generally called
developed countries.

ee - eee J) NDERSTANDING ECoNnomic DEVELOPMENT

Average Income

While averages are useful for comparison, they also hide disparities

For example, let us consider two countries, A and
B. For the sake of simplicity, we have assumed
that they have only five citizens each. Based on
data given in Table 1.2, calculate the average
income for both the countries.

TABLE 1.2 COMPARISON OF TWO

COUNTRIES

Monthly incomes of citizens
(in Rupees)

wv rae
Country A |9500 |10500| 9800 | 10000 10200]

Will you be equally happy to live in both these
countries? Are both equally developed? Perhaps
some of us may like to live in country B if we are

assured of being its fifth citizen
but if it is a lottery that decides
our citizenship number then
perhaps most of us will prefer to
live in country A. Even though
both the countries have identical
average income, country A is
preferred because it has more
equitable distribution. In this
country people are neither very
rich nor extremely poor. On the
other hand most citizens in
country B are poor and one
person is extremely rich. Hence,
while average income is useful for
comparison it does not tell us how
this income is distributed among
people.

4. Suppose records show that the average income in a country has been increasing
over a period of time. From this, can we conclude that all sections of the economy

TABLE 1.4

Haryana

Bihar

When we looked at
individual aspirations and
goals, we found that people
not only think of better
income but also have goals
such as security, respect for
others, equal treatment,
freedom, etc. in mind.
Similarly, when we think ofa
nation or a region, we may,
besides average income,
think of other equally
important attributes.

What could these attributes be? Let
us examine this through an example.
Table 1.3 gives the per capita income
of Haryana, Kerala and Bihar.
Actually, these figures are of Per
Capita Net State Domestic Product at
Current Prices for 2021-22. Let us
ignore what this complicated term
exactly means. Roughly, we can take
it to be the per capita income of the
state. We find that of the three,
Haryana has the highest per capita

income and Bihar is at the bottom.
This means that, on an average,
a person in Haryana earned
Rs 2,64,729 in one year whereas, on
an average, a person in Bihar earned
only around Rs 47,500. So, if per
capita income were to be used as the
measure of development, Haryana will
be considered the most developed
and Bihar the least developed state of
the three. Now, let us look at certain
other data pertaining to these states
given in Table 1.4.

Explanation of some of the terms used in this table:

Infant Mortality Rate (or IMR) indicates the number of children that die before the age of one
year as a proportion of 1000 live children born in that particular year.

Literacy Rate measures the proportion of literate population in the 7-and-above age group.

Net Attendance Ratio is the total number of children of age group of 15-17 years attending
school as a percentage of total number of children in the same age group.

Reprint 2025-26

es kh) eee J) NDERSTANDING EConomic DEVELOPMENT

What does this table show? The
first column of the table shows that
in Kerala, out of 1000 children born,
6 died before completing one year of
age but in Haryana the proportion of
children dying within one year of birth
was 28, which is nearly three times
more than that of Kerala. On the other
hand, the per capita income of
Haryana is more than that of Kerala
as shown in Table 1.3. Just think of
how dear you are to your parents,
think of how every one is so happy
when a child is born. Now, try to think
of parents whose children die before
they even celebrate their first birthday.
How painful it must be to these
parents? Next, note the year to which
this data pertains. This was during
2018. So we are not talking of old
times; it is 70 years after independence
when our metro cities are full of high
rise buildings and shopping malls!

How is it that the average person in
Haryana has more income than the
average person in Kerala but lags
behind in these crucial areas? The
reason is money in your pocket
cannot buy all the goods and services
that you may need to live well. So,
income by itself is not a completely
adequate indicator of material goods and
services that citizens are able to use.
For example, normally, your money
cannot buy you a pollution-free
environment or ensure that you get
unadulterated medicines, unless you
can afford to shift to a community that
already has all these things. Money may
also not be able to protect you from
infectious diseases, unless the whole of
your community takes preventive steps.

The problem does not end with
Infant Mortality Rate. The last
column of table 1.4 shows that
about one-third of the children aged
15-17 years in Bihar are not
attending school in secondary
classes. This means that if you went
to school in Bihar nearly one-third
of your class friends would be
missing. Those who could have been
in school are not there! If this had
happened to you, you would not be
able to read what you are reading now.

Most babies require basic healthcare

PUBLIC FACILITIES

Actually for many of the important
things in life the best way, also the
cheapest way, is to provide these
goods and services collectively. Just
think will it be cheaper to have
collective security for the whole
locality or for each house to have its
own security staff? What if no one,
other than you, in your village or locality
is interested in studying? Would you be
able to study? Not unless your parents
could afford to send you to some private
school elsewhere. So you are actually
able to study because many other
children also want to study and because
many people believe that the government
should open schools and provide other
facilities so that all children have a chance
to study Even now, in many areas,
children, particularly girls, are not able

you may need to make calculations based on the table.

(a) The literacy rate for all age groups, including young and old, is for rural
males and for rural females. However, it is not just that these many
adults could not attend school but that there are who are currently not in
school.

It is clear from the table that % of rural girls and % of rural boys are
not attending school. Therefore, illiteracy among children in the age group 1014 is as high as % for rural females and % for rural males.

This high level of illiteracy among ________ age group, even after more than
75 years of our independence, is most disturbing. In many other states also we
are nowhere near realisation of the constitutional goal of free and compulsory
education for all children up to the age of 14, which was expected to be achieved
by 1960.

ACTIVITY 3

One way to find out if we are properly nourished is to
calculate what nutrition scientists call Body Mass Index
(BMI). This is easy to calculate. Let each student in
the class find out his or her weight and height. Take the
weight of each student in kilograms (kg). Then, take
the height by drawing up a scale on the wall and
measuring accurately with the head straight. Convert
the height recorded in centimeters into meters. Divide
the weight in kg by the square of the height. The number
you get is called BMI. Then, look at the BMI-for-Age
tables given on pages

90-91. A student s BMI

could be within the normal

range or less than that

(underweight) or more

(obesity). For example, if

a girl student is 14 years

and 8 month old and the

BMI is 15.2, then she is

undernourished. Similarly,

if the BMI of a boy aged

15 years and 6 months is

28, then he is overweight.

HUMAN DEVELOPMEN
REPORT

Once it is realised that even though

the level of income is important, yet it
is an inadequate measure of the level
of development, we begin to think of
other criterion. There could be a long
list of such criterion but then it would
not be so useful. What we need is a

small number of the most important
things. Health and education

indicators, such as the ones we used
in comparison of Kerala and Haryana,

are among them. Over the past decade
or so, health and education indicators
have come to be widely used along
with income as a measure of
development. For instance, Human

Development Report published by
UNDP compares countries based on

the educational levels of the people,

their health status and per capita

income. It would be interesting to look
at certain relevant data regarding
India and its neighbours from Human

Development Report 2023-24.

Isn't it surprising that a small
country in our neighbourhood, Sri
Lanka, is much ahead of India in every
respect and a big country like ours has
such a low rank in the world? Table
1.6 also shows that though Nepal and
Bangladesh have low per capita
income than that of India, yet they are
better than India in life expectancy.

Many improvements have been
suggested in calculating HDI and

many new components have been
added to the Human Development
Report but, by pre-fixing Human to
Development, it has made it very clear
that what is important in development
is what is happening to citizens of a
country. Itis people, their health, their
well being, that is most important.

Do you think there are certain
other aspects that should be
considered in measuring human
development?

SUSTAINABILITY OF DEVELOPMENT

Suppose for the present that a
particular country is quite developed.
We would certainly like this level of
development to go up further or at
least be maintained for future
generations. This is obviously
desirable. However, since the second
half of the twentieth century, a number
of scientists have been warning that
the present type, and levels, of
development are not sustainable.

 We have not inherited
the world from our
forefathers we have
borrowed it from our
children. 

WHY
LETS UNDERSTAND
THIS IS 50 THROUGH THE
FOLLOWING EXAMPLE:

Example 1: Groundwater im India
 Recent evidence suggests that the groundwater is under serious
threat of overuse in many parts of the country. About 300 districts
have reported a water level decline of over 4 metres during the
past 20 years. Nearly one-third of the country is overusing their
groundwater reserves. In another 25 _ years,
60 per cent of the country would be doing the same if the present
way of using this resource continues. Groundwater overuse is
particularly found in the agriculturally prosperous regions of
Punjab and Western U.P., hard rock plateau areas of central and
south India, some coastal areas and the rapidly growing urban
settlements. 

(a) Why groundwater is overused?
(b) Can there be development without overuse?

es 2 See) NDERSTANDING EConomic DEVELOPMENT

Reprint 2025-26

Groundwater is an example of
renewable resources. These resources
are replenished by nature as in the
case of crops and plants. However,
even these resources may be
overused. For example, in the case of
groundwater, if we use more than
what is being replenished by rain then
we would be overusing this resource.

would last only 50 years more. This is for the world as a whole. However,
different countries face different situations. Countries like India depend
on importing oil from abroad because they do not have enough stocks
of their own. If prices of oil increase this becomes a burden for everyone.
There are countries like USA which have low reserves and hence want to
secure oil through military or economic power.

The question of sustainability of development raises many fundamentally
newissues about the nature and process of development.

(a) Is crude oil essential for the development process in a country?

Discuss.

(b) India has to import crude oil. What problems do you anticipate
for the country looking at the above situation?

Non-renewable resources are those
which will get exhausted after a few
years of use. We have a fixed stock on
earth which cannot be replenished. We
do discover new resources that we did
not know of earlier. New sources in
this way add to the stock. However,
over time, even this will get exhausted.

Consequences of environmental
degradation do not respect national
or state boundaries; this issue is
no longer region or nation specific.
Our future is linked together.
Sustainability of development is
comparatively a new area of
knowledge in which scientists,
economists, philosophers and other

social scientists are working
together.

In general, the question of
development or progress is perennial.
At all times as a member of society
and as individuals we need to ask
where we want to go, what we wish to
become and what our goals are. So
the debate on development continues.

EXERCISES

1. Development of a country can generally be determined by
(i) its per capita income
(ii) its average literacy level
(iii) health status of its people
(iv) all the above
. Which of the following neighbouring countries has better performance in terms of
human development than India?
(i) Bangladesh
(ii) Sri Lanka
(iii) Nepal
(iv) Pakistan
. Assume there are four families in a country. The average per capita income of

these families is Rs 5000. If the income of three families is Rs 4000, Rs 7000
and Rs 3000 respectively, what is the income of the fourth family?

(i) Rs 7500
(ii) Rs 3000
(iii) Rs 2000
(iv) Rs 6000

. What is the main criterion used by the World Bank in classifying different
countries? What are the limitations of this criterion, if any?

. In what respects is the criterion used by the UNDP for measuring development
different from the one used by the World Bank?

. Why do we use averages? Are there any limitations to their use? Illustrate with
your own examples related to development.

. Kerala, with lower per capita income has a better human development ranking
than Haryana. Hence, per capita income is not a useful criterion at all and should
not be used to compare states. Do you agree? Discuss.

. Find out the present sources of energy that are used by the people in India. What
could be the other possibilities fifty years from now?

. Why is the issue of sustainability important for development?

satisfy the greed of even one person . How is this statement relevant to the
disscusion of development? Discuss.

. List a few examples of environmental degradation that you may have observed
around you.

. For each of the items given in Table 1.6, find out which country is at the top and
which is at the bottom.

. The following table shows the proportion of adults (aged 15-49 years) whose BMI
is below normal (BMI <18.5 kg/m?) in India. It is based on a survey of various
states for the year 2019-21. Look at the table and answer the following questions.

(i) Compare the nutritional level of people in Kerala and Madhya Pradesh.

(ii) Can you guess why around one-fifth of people in the country are
undernourished even though it is argued that there is enough food in the
country? Describe in your own words.
