NOTES FOR THE TEACHER

CHAPTER 5 : CONSUMER RIGHTS

This chapter proposes to discuss the issue of
consumer rights within the context of the ways
markets operate in our country. There are many
aspects of unequal situations in a market and
poor enforcement of rules and regulations.
Hence, there is a need to sensitise learners and
encourage them to participate in the consumer
movement. This chapter provides case histories
 how some consumers were exploited in real
life situation and how legal institutions helped
in getting compensated and in
upholding their rights. The case histories would
enable the students to link these narratives to
their life experiences. We have to enable
students to understand that the awareness of
being a well-informed consumer arose out of
consumer movement and active participation of
people through their struggles over a long
period. This chapter also provides details of a
few organisations helping consumers in different
ways. Finally, it ends with some critical issues
of the consumer movement in India.

Aspects of Teaching / Sources of
Information

This chapter has questions, case studies and
activities. It would be preferred that students
discuss these in groups orally. Some of these
could be answered in writing individually.

While carrying out each activity you could
start with a brainstorming session about the
activity. Similarly, there are many opportunities
for roleplay in this chapter and this could be a
useful way to share their experiences and
understand the issues at a deeper level. Making

posters collectively is another way to think about
these issues. This lesson contains activities,
which require visits visit to consumer
protection councils, consumer organisations,
District/State/National level Consumer
Disputes Redressal Commissions, retail shops,
marketplaces, etc. Organise the visits to
maximise learners experience. Have a
discussion with them about the purpose of the
visit, things they need to do beforehand and
things that need to be collected and the task
(report/ project / article, etc.) they would carry
out after the visit. As part of this chapter, the
learners may do letter-writing and speaking
activities. We may have to be sensitive to the
language aspect of exercises.

This chapter contains material collected
from authenticated websites, books, newspapers
and magazines. For example, https://consumer
affairs.nic.inis a website of Central Government
Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public
Distribution. Another website www.cutsinternational.org is the website of a consumer
organisation working in India for 40 years. It
publishes a variety of material to create
consumer awareness in India. They need to be
shared among learners so that they can also
collect material as part of their activities. For
example, case histories were taken from
newspaper clippings and consumers who fought
in Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions.
Let learners collect and read such material from
different sources: consumer protection councils,
Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions
and internet.

THE CONSUMER IN THE MARKETPLACE

We participate in the market both as
producers and consumers. As
producers of goods and services we
could be working in any of the sectors
discussed earlier such as agriculture,
industry, or services. Consumers
participate in the market when they
purchase goods and services that they
need. These are the final goods that
people as consumers use.

In the preceding chapters we
discussed the need for rules and
regulations or steps that would
promote development. These could be
for the protection of workers in the
unorganised sector or to protect
people from high interest rates
charged by moneylenders in the
informal sector. Similarly, rules and
regulations are also required for
protecting the environment.

For example, moneylenders in the
informal sector that you read about
in Chapter 3 adopt various tricks to
bind the borrower: they could make
the producer sell the produce to them
at a low rate in return for a timely loan;
they could force a small farmer like
Swapna to sell her land to pay back
the loan. Similarly, many people who
work in the unorganised sector have
to work at a low wage and accept
conditions that are not fair and are
also often harmful to their health. To
prevent such exploitation, we
have talked of rules and regulations
for their protection. There are
organisations that have struggled
for long to ensure that these rules are
followed.

Reprint 2025-26

Likewise, rules and regulations are
required for the protection of the
consumers in the marketplace.
Individual consumers often find
themselves in a weak position.
Whenever there is a complaint
regarding a good or service that had
been bought, the seller tries to shift
all the responsibility on to the buyer.
Their position usually is - If you
didn t like what you bought, please
go elsewhere . As if the seller has no
responsibility once a sale is
completed! The consumer movement,
as we shall discuss later, is an effort
to change this situation.

Exploitation in the marketplace
happens in various ways. For
example, sometimes traders indulge
in unfair trade practices such as when
shopkeepers weigh less than what
they should or when traders add
charges that were not mentioned
before, or when adulterated /defective
goods are sold.

Markets do not work in a fair
manner when producers are few and
powerful whereas consumers
purchase in small amounts and are
scattered. This happens especially
when large companies are producing
these goods. These companies with
huge wealth, power and reach can
manipulate the market in various
ways. At times false information is
passed on through the media, and
other sources to attract consumers.
For example, a company for years
sold powder milk for babies all over

the world as the most scientific
product claiming this to be better
than mother s milk. It took years of
struggle before the company was
forced to accept that it had been
making false claims. Similarly, a
long battle had to be fought with
court cases to make cigarettemanufacturing companies accept that
their product could cause cancer.
Hence, there is a need for rules and
regulations to ensure protection for

consumers.

2. Think of one example from your experience where you thought that there was some

3. What do you think should be the role of government to protect consumers?

CONSUMER MOVEMENT

The consumer movement arose out
of dissatisfaction of the consumers
as many unfair practices were being
indulged in by the sellers. There was
no legal system available to
consumers to protect them from
exploitation in the marketplace. For
a long time, when a consumer was
not happy with a particular brand
product or shop, he or she generally
avoided buying that brand product,
or would stop purchasing from that
shop. It was presumed that it was
the responsibility of consumers to be
careful while buying a commodity
or service. It took many years for
organisations in India, and around
the world, to create awareness
amongst people. This has also
shifted the responsibility of ensuring

quality of goods and services on the
sellers.

In India, the consumer movement
as a social force originated with the
necessity of protecting and promoting
the interests of consumers against
unethical and unfair trade practices.
Rampant food shortages, hoarding,
black marketing, adulteration of food
and edible oil gave birth to the
consumer movement in an organised
form in the 1960s. Till the 1970s,
consumer organisations were largely
engaged in writing articles and
holding exhibitions. They formed
consumer groups to look into the
malpractices in ration shops and
overcrowding in the road passenger
transport. More recently, India
witnessed an upsurge in the number
of consumer groups.

Consumers InternationaLl

In 1985 United Nations adopted
the UN Guidelines for Consumer
Protection. This was a tool for
nations to adopt measures to
protect consumers and for
consumer advocacy groups to
press their governments to do
so. At the international level, this
has become the foundation for
consumer movement. Today,
Consumers International has
become an umbrella body to
over 200 member organisations
from over 100 countries.

Because of all these efforts, the movement succeeded in
bringing pressure on business firms as well as government
to correct business conduct which may be unfair and against
the interests of consumers at large. A major step taken in
1986 by the Indian government was the enactment of the
Consumer Protection Act 1986, popularly known as COPRA.
You will learn more about COPRA later.

Reji'y Suffering

Reji Mathew, a healthy boy studying in
Class IX, was admitted in a private clinic in
Kerala for removal of tonsils. An ENT
surgeon performed the tonsillectomy
operation under general anaesthesia. As a
result of improper anaesthesia Reji showed
symptoms of some brain abnormalities
because of which he was crippled for life.

His father filed a complaint in the State
Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission
claiming compensation of Rs 5,00,000 for
medical negligence and deficiency, in
service. The State Commission, saying that
the evidence was not sufficient, dismissed
it. Reji s father appealed again in the
National Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission located
in New Delhi. The
National Commission
after looking into the
complaint, held the
hospital responsible
for medical negligence
and directed it to pay
the compensation.

CONSUMER RIGHTS

SAFETY IS EVERYONE S RIGHT

Reji s suffering shows how a
hospital, due to negligence by the
doctors and staff in giving
anaesthesia, crippled a student for
life. While using many goods and
services, we as consumers, have the
right to be protected against the
marketing of goods and delivery of
services that are hazardous to life and
property. Producers need to strictly
follow the required safety rules and
regulations. There are many goods
and services that we purchase that
require special attention to safety. For
example, pressure cookers have a
safety valve which, if it is defective, can
cause a serious accident. The
manufacturers of the safety valve have
to ensure high quality. You also need
public or government action to see
that this quality is maintained.
However, we do find bad quality
products in the market because the
supervision of these rules is weak and
the consumer movement is also not
strong enough.

LET S WORK THESE OUT

1. For the following (you can add to the list) products/services discuss what safety
rules should be observed by the producer?

(a) LPG cylinder (b) cinema theatre (c) circus (d) medicines (e) edible oil

2. Find out any case of accident or negligence from people around you, where you think
that the responsibility lay with the producer. Discuss.

Information about goods and
services

When you buy any commodity, you
will find certain details given on the
packing. These details are about
ingredients used, price, batch
number, date of manufacture, expiry
date and the address of the
manufacturer. When we buy
medicines, on the packets, you might
find directions for proper use and
information relating to side effects and
risks associated with usage of that
medicine. When you buy garments,
you will find information on
 instructions for washing .

Why is it that rules have been made
so that the manufacturer displays this
information? It is because consumers
have the right to be informed about
the particulars of goods and services
that they purchase. Consumers
can then complain and ask for
compensation or replacement if the
product proves to be defective in any
manner. For example, if we buy a

product and find it defective well
within the expiry period, we can ask
for areplacement. If the expiry period
was not printed, the manufacturer
would blame the shopkeeper and will
not accept the responsibility. If people
sell medicines that have expired
severe action can be taken against
them. Similarly, one can protest and
complain if someone sells a good at
more than the printed price on the
packet. This is indicated by MRP 
maximum retail price. In fact
consumers can bargain with the seller
to sell at less than the MRP.

In recent times, the right to
information has been expanded to
cover various services provided by the
Government. In October 2005, the
Government of India enacted a law,
popularly known as RTI (Right to
Information) Act, which ensures its
citizens all the information about the
functions of government departments.
The effect of the RTI Act can be
understood from the following case.

Waiting.

Amritha, an engineering graduate
after submitting all the certificates
and attending the interview for a
job ina government department, did
not receive any news of the result.
The officials also refused to comply
with her queries. She therefore filed
an application using the RTI Act
saying that it was her right to know
the result in a reasonable time so
that she could plan her future. She
was not only informed about the
reasons for delay in the declaration
of results but also got her call letter
for appointment as she performed
well in the interview.

Abirami, a student of Ansari

course at a local coaching

courses in New Delhi. At the

the institute to pay

out of the course at the end of one year
as she found that the quality of
teaching was not up to the mark. When
she asked for a refund of the fee for one
year, it was denied to her.

When she filed the case in the District
Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission, the Commission directed
the Institute to refund Rs 28,000 saying
that she had the right to choose. The

Rs 7000 as compensation and
litigation cost.

The State Commission also restrained
all the educational and professional
institutions in the state from charging
fees from students for the entire
duration of the course in advance and
that too at one go. Any violation of this
order may invite penalties and
imprisonment, the commission said.

What do we understand from this
incident? Any consumer who receives a
service in whatever capacity, regardless
of age, gender and nature of service, has
the right to choose whether to
continue to receive the service.

Suppose you want to buy
toothpaste, and the shop owner says
that she can sell the toothpaste only

if you buy a toothbrush. If you are not
interested in buying the brush, your
right to choice is denied. Similarly,
sometimes gas supply dealers insist
that you have to buy the stove from
them when you take a new connection.
In this way many a times you are
forced to buy things that you may not
wish to and you are left with no choice.

Consumers have the right to seek
redressal against unfair trade
practices and exploitation. If any
damage is done to a consumer, she
has the right to get compensation
depending on the degree of damage.
There is a need to provide an easy and
effective public system by which this

TAKING THE CONSUMER MOVEMENT FORWARD

India has been observing 24 _ their activities. There are today more

December as the National Consumers 
Day. It was on this day that the Indian
Parliament enacted the Consumer
Protection Act in 1986. India is one
of the countries that have exclusive
authority for consumer redressal.

The consumer movement in India
has made some progress in terms of
numbers of organised groups and

than 2000 consumer groups in the
country of which only about 50-60
are well organised and recognised for
their work.

However, the consumer redressal
process is becoming cumbersome,
expensive and time consuming. Many
a time, consumers are required to
engage lawyers. These cases require

time for filing and attending the
commission proceedings etc. In most
purchases cash memos are not issued
hence evidence is not easy to gather.
Moreover most purchases in the
market are small retail sales. The
COPRA was amended in the year
2019 to further strengthen
consumers in India. Buying through
internet is now included. If there is any
service deficiency or defective product,
service provider or manufacturer is
also held responsible and would be
penalized or even imprisoned.
Settlement of disputes with the help
of a neutral intermediary outside the
Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission, called mediator, is now

encouraged at all the three tiers
Consumer Commissions. After more
than 30 years of the enactment of
COPRA, consumer awareness in India
is spreading but slowly. Besides this
the enforcement of laws that protect
workers, especially in the
unorganised sectors is weak.
Similarly, rules and regulations for
working of markets are often not
followed.

Nevertheless, there is scope for
consumers to realise their role and
importance. It is often said that
consumer movements can be effective
only with the consumers active
involvement. It requires a voluntary
effort and struggle involving the
participation of one and all.
