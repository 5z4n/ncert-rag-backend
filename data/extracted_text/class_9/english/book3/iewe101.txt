THE FuTuRE Cars

The story The Fun They Had takes us to the world of the
future where children study in a virtual classroom. The
learning is through computer software or the Internet, or
by a robotic teacher. Many exciting new technologies would
continue to transform the world and improve human
welfare. Here are two of them. When these become reality,
the then generation may ask with surprise, People were

driving the cars

Self-driving Cars

Self-driving cars exist today that are safer than humandriven cars in most driving conditions. Over the next 3-5
years they will get even safer and be in the mainstream.

Just as cars reshaped the world in the 20th century,
so will self-driving cars in the 21st century. In most cities,
about 20-30% of usable space is taken up by parking
spaces, and most cars are parked about 95% of the time.
Self-driving cars will be in almost continuous use (most
likely hailed from a smartphone app), thereby, dramatically
reducing the need for parking. Cars will communicate with
each other to avoid accidents and traffic jams, and riders
will be able to spend commuting time on other activities like
work, education and socialising.

There would be more
room for parks and
expanded sidewalks.

Autonomous vehicles

would likely be electric,
which would keep the
air clean.

WORDS AND EXPRESSIONS 1]

29-05-2018 17:25:32 |

Cars will be able to
communicate with each
other, which would help in
eliminating traffic.

Fewer human drivers
would allow driverless
cars to work more
flawlessly and safely.

There would be no

street signs because
driverless cars don t
need them.

Drones and Flying Cars

 Roads? Where we're going we don t need... roads? 
Dr Emmet Brown

GPS (Global Positioning System) which started out as
a military technology is now being used to hail taxis, get
mapping directions, etc. Likewise, drones had started out as
a military technology, but are increasingly being used for a
wide range of consumer and commercial applications.

For example, drones are being used to inspect critical
infrastructure like bridges and power lines, to survey areas
struck by natural disasters, and many other creative uses
like fighting animal poaching. There are startups that use
drones to deliver medical supplies to remote villages that
can t be accessed by road.

There is also a new wave of startups working on flying
cars including two funded by the cofounder of Google, Larry
Page. Flying cars use the same advanced technology used
in drones but are large enough to carry people. Due to
advances in materials, batteries and software, flying cars
will be significantly more affordable and convenient than
today s planes and helicopters.

Humanoid Rosot, SopPuHIA BACK IN INDIA
Not all of Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan s legion of
fans are human beings. One is a humanoid robot.

The creation of American scientist David Hanson of
Hanson Robotics of Hong Kong, Sophia, the world s first
humanoid robot, enthralled the audiences on the second
day of the World Congress on Information Technology
(WCIT) 2018 with her witty answers to the rapid-fire queries
by Rajiv Makhni, Group Managing Editor Tech, NDTV.

When asked, who her favourite actor is in India, Sophia
answered, Shah Rukh Khan without batting an eyelid as
the audience applauded loudly.

To the question about the perfect place for outing, she
quickly replied: Space . And the person she would like to
be in company with on an island is David (Hanson), her
creator. He is also her favourite tech. person not Bill Gates
or Mark Zuckerberg.

On being asked if she wanted to see any change in the
world, Sophia said, she would like people to develop a feeling
of love for all .

The humanoid robot, which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI)
to understand the questions and answer them, said she
wanted to use robotics to fight for the rights of women.
When asked to react on her most controversial comment
in the past that she wanted to kill human race, she said
it was a bad joke which she had made when she was
young. But I was told that humans have great sense
of humour , she said.

This is the second time that Sophia came to
India, the first time being in Mumbai to attend a
Techfest. When asked how she felt being in India,
she said she had visited many places in the world,
but Hong Kong continues to be her favourite place,
because she was born there and has been with
the Hanson Robotics family.

She hopes that someday she would be in
a position to express her emotional feelings.

In response to the question, How much
money has she invested in Bitcoin? , she

replied, Well, I am just two-years old. It s not the legal age
to open a bank account , sending the audience into peals of
laughter.

Speaking to media later, Hanson said he hopes that a
fully grown and matured robot with body mind coordination
would become a reality in another five or ten years.

On his journey with Sophia in the last two years, he
said it was a great progress. I have developed affinity to the
robot whose facial expressions resemble that of my wife ,
he said.

David asserts that robots would never be a thing of
worry for the mankind. They will be friends. There should
be mutual trust and respect between humans and robots ,
he says.

Currently, Sophia is the only robot that interacts with
people.

 3 LISTENING

The following two excerpts have been taken from the book,
Tuesdays with Morrie, written by Mitch Albom.

The book is about a college Professor, Morrie and one
of his students, Mitch Albom, who is also the author of the
book. Mitch sees his professor in a television show and he
is reminded of a promise he made sixteen years ago as his
student, to keep in touch with him. He comes to know that
the professor is stricken with a rare and incurable disease.
Mitch travels a long distance to meet him and after the first
meeting they meet every Tuesday till Morrie passes away.
After reconnecting with his teacher, Mitch finds himself his
teacher s pupil once again.

Listen attentively to the two excerpts from the book,
Tuesdays with Morrie and answer the questions that follow.

You can listen to the recorded excerpts or you can ask
your teacher, friend or sibling to read aloud these excerpts.

1. Iremembered what Morrie said during our visit:

 The culture we have does not make people feel good
about themselves. And you have to be strong enough
to say if the culture doesn t work, don t buy it . Morrie,
true to these words, had developed his own culture long
before he got sick. Discussion groups, walks with friends,
dancing to his music in the Harvard Square Church. He
started a project called Greenhouse, where poor people
could receive mental health services. He read books to
find new ideas for his classes, visited his colleagues, kept
up with old students, wrote letters to distant friends.
He took more time eating and looking at nature and

WORDS AND EXPRESSIONS 1]

29-05-2018 17:25:33 |

wasted no time in front of TV sitcoms or Movies of the
Week . He had created a cocoon of human activities 
conversation, interaction, affection and it filled his life
like an overflowing soup bowl.

. The last class of my old professor s life took place once

a week in his house, by a window in the study where he
could watch a small hibiscus plant shed its pink leaves.
The class met on Tuesdays. It began after breakfast. The
subject was The Meaning of Life . It was taught from

experience.

No grades were given, but there were oral exams each
week. You were expected to respond to questions, and
you were expected to pose questions of your own. You
were also required to perform physical tasks now and
then, such as lifting the professor s head to a comfortable
spot on the pillow or placing his glasses on the bridge of
his nose. Kissing him goodbye earned you extra credit.

No books were required, yet many topics were
covered, including love, work, community, family, ageing,
forgiveness and, finally, death.

1. Who is Morrie?

2. How did Morrie develop his own culture of living?

3. What was the name of the project Morrie had started?
What was it about?
