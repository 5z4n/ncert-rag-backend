READING COMPREHENSION

Read the passage below and answer the questions that
follow.

Tue Wor Lp as I SEE It

In my opinion, the present symptoms of decadence are
explained by the fact that the development of industry and
machinery has made the struggle for existence very much
more severe, greatly to the detriment of the free development
of the individual. But the development of machinery means
that less and less work is needed from the individual for the
satisfaction of the community s needs. A planned division
of labour is becoming more and more of a crying necessity
and this division will lead to the material security of the
individual. This security and the spare time and energy
which the individual will have at his command can be made
to further his development. In this way the community may
regain its health, and we will hope that future historians will
explain the morbid symptoms of present-day society as the
childhood ailments of an aspiring humanity, due entirely to
the excessive speed at which civilisation was advancing.

(An extract from The World As I See It by A. Einstein)

clauses (Beehive, p. 52). We know that participle clause
is a form of adverbial clause which enables us to say
information in a more economical way. We can use
participle clauses when the participle and verb in the
main clause have the same subject.

Gautama Buddha was journeying through the Kosala region.
He was warned not to pass through the deep jungle, as it
was the den of a famous robber chief, Angulimala. He was
the terror of the whole countryside. He lived by plundering
travellers and feared no one. He had committed many
murders. All attempts to capture the inhuman Angulimala
had failed. So he continued his crimes unpunished. The
people of Kosala pleaded with the Buddha not to expose
himself to the dangers of the robber s territory.

But Gautama Buddha knew no fear. The warnings of the
people of Kosala did not affect him. He made his way into
the jungle. Angulimala got enraged at this boldness. He was

determined to kill the intruder. But when he saw the Buddha,
calm and self-possessed, and heard his words of kindness,
the robber hesitated. His arm, which had been uplifted to kill,
fell helpless by his side. His wrath cooled, and he knelt down
before the Buddha. He confessed all his sins and declared his
faith in the Buddha. When the people saw the new disciple

following his Master, they were amazed and could not believe

that this was the ferocious man who had been a terror for

so long. Angulimala became a monk. His past was forgotten,

and he was widely respected for his holiness.
