Do you know?

A river in New Zealand has become the first in the world
to be recognised as a living entity with the legal status of a
person after a 170-year battle by the local Maori people.

The nation s parliament passed a bill to allow Whanganui
River known by the Maoris as Te Awa Tupua to represent
its own interests and advocate on its own behalf.

This is a unique judgement for sustaining the health and
well-being of the river.

Read the following passage and answer the questions that
follow.

When we think of tourism, we think primarily of people who
are visiting a particular place for sightseeing, visiting friends
and relatives, taking a vacation, and having a good time. They
may spend their leisure time engaging in various sports,
sunbathing, talking, singing, taking rides, touring, reading
or simply enjoying further. We may include in our definition
of tourism people who are participating in a convention,
a business conference, or some other kind of business or
professional activity. Those who are taking a study tour under
an expert guide or doing some kind of scientific research or
study are also doing tourism. These visitors use all forms of

transportation from hiking in a wilderness park to flying in = chairlifl: a series of chairs
hanging from a moving
cable, for carrying people up
and down a mountain

a jet to an exciting city. Transportation can include taking a
chairlift up a Colorado mountainside or standing at the rail
of a cruise ship looking across the blue Caribbean. Whether
people travel by one of these means or by car, motor coach
camper, train, motorbike or bicycle, they are taking a trip
and thus are engaging in tourism.

Charles R. Goeldner and J.R. Brent Ritchie, p. 4)

plants that have been grabbing all eyeballs.

All plants emit oxygen, but it was established in a study
conducted by National Aeronautics and Space Administration
back in 1989 that some indoor plants could be extremely
useful in controlling the air pollution by acting as a vacuum
cleaner against the pollutants and absorbing them.

Detox plants, which act as vacuum cleaners inside the
house, are a hit in the ongoing event. Nature enthusiasts
are preferring them for pollution control as well as interior

A Visit to Bhitarkanika

The sun was warm but the sea breeze kept up its cooling
effect all along. Soon the steamer turned away and anchored
near a creek by the river. The muddy fringe and the mangrove
vegetation declared the gateway to the Bhitarkanika Wildlife
Sanctuary in Odisha. The steamer could not negotiate these
creeks at low tide, so a similar motorboat was hired to ferry
us to the Dangmal forest rest-house in the heart of the
mangrove forest. From the motorboat we had a good look at
a large crocodile basking in the sun.

The boat moved on, taking us deeper into the forest.
Here we felt as though we had stepped into a time warp. In
this awesome and mysterious place, birds of extraordinary
plumage appeared before us. For the moment we revelled
in the magnificence of nature which had us completely in
its thrall. Among the birds, the kingfishers were the stars of
the show. Crocodiles, large and small, slid into the water at
our approach. Through the foliage we could see chital deer
delicately browsing on fresh outcrops of leaves.

A herd of wild boar was spotted searching for succulent
roots. High above us, open-billed storks stood sentry-like
following our progress through their remarkable kingdom.
The evening sun was beginning to paint the tree-lined horizon
crimson and gold and a brooding silence enveloped us all.

 Travelling it leaves you speechless, then turns you into a
storyteller. 

(Ibn Batuta, a 14th century traveller)

 Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness,

and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts.

Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things

cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the
earth all one s lifetime.

1. You have read about the mesmerising effect of the music
of flute on Vikram Seth in Kathmandu .

Do you know the instruments for Sufi music differ from
one culture to another? In Turkey, Iran and North Africa,
the most prominent instrument is the Ney which is the
reed flute. In Sufi music the Ney is accompanied by string

instruments like saz, santoor, rubab, etc.
Create a class magazine on music and artists. Some

suggestions are given below.
 Collect information on the commonly used musical
instruments in the following categories:

 
 
 
 
 

Indian classical music

Ghazal singing

Bharatnatayam, Chau and Kathak dance

Jazz

 Collect photographs of musical instruments.

e Prepare brief biographical sketches of musicians,
dancers, costume designers, artists, etc. You can meet
some of them or collect information from sources like
books, Internet, magazines, newspapers, etc.

 Give a suitable name to the magazine.

2. Plan a trip to the North-east region of the country by
road. Explore the various possibilities of the travel. Also,
create a map of your travel.

NoTEs
