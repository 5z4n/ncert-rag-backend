 3REaDING COMPREHENSION

Read the following passages and answer the questions that
follow.

I must have been about seven when my father left Porbandar
for Rajkot to become a member of the Rajasthanik Court.
There I was put into a primary school, and I can well recollect
those days, including the names and other particulars of the
teachers who taught me. As at Porbandar, so here, there is
hardly anything to note about my studies. I could only have
been a mediocre student. From this school I went to the
suburban school and thence to high school, having already
reached my twelfth year. I do not remember having ever
told a lie, during this short period, either to my teachers
or to my school-mates. However, I used to be very shy and
avoided all company. My books and my lessons were my sole
companions. To be at school at the stroke of the hour and
to run back home as soon as the school closed that was
my daily habit. There is an incident which occurred at the
examination during my first year at high school and which
is worth recording. Mr Giles, the educational Inspector, had
come on a visit of inspection. He had set us five words to
write as a spelling exercise. One of the words was Kettle .
I had misspelt it. The teacher tried to prompt me with the
point of his boot, but I would not be prompted. It was beyond
me to see that he wanted me to copy the spelling from my
neighbour s slate, for I had thought that the teacher was
there to supervise us against copying. The result was that
all the boys, except myself, were found to have spelt every
word correctly. I could never learn the art of copying . Yet
the incident did not in the least diminish my respect for my
teacher. I was by nature, blind to the faults of elders. Later
I came to know of many other failings of this teacher, but
my regard for him remained the same. Two other incidents
belonging to the same period have always clung to my
memory. As a rule I had distaste for any reading beyond
my school books. The daily lessons had to be done, because
I disliked being taken to task by my teacher as much as I
disliked deceiving him. Therefore I would do the lessons,

but often without my mind in them. Thus, when even the
lessons could not be done properly, there was of course no

question of any extra reading. But somehow my eyes fell on
a book purchased by my father. It was Shravana Pitribhakti
Nataka. I read it with intense interest. One of the pictures I
was shown was of Shravana carrying, by means of slings fitted
for his shoulders, his blind parents on a pilgrimage. The book

and the picture left an indelible impression on my mind.

Indra Krishnamurthy Nooyi is an Indian American business
executive. She is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
of Pepsico. She is one among the world s most powerful
women. She delivered the following speech at the Rashtrapati
Bhawan on 14 December 2013. She was named one of the
25 Greatest Living Legends by NDTV, and was awarded
by the then President of India, Pranab Mukherjee at the
Rashtrapati Bhawan.

Read the speech delivered by Indra Nooyi and answer the
questions that follow.

Mr President and NDTV, thank you very much for this
incredible honour.

Malcom Gladwell in his book, Outliers says: Who you
are cannot be separated from where you came from. 

I left India 35 years ago, went to the USA and had
tremendous success in the meritocracy. But none of that
could have happened if I would not have had wonderful
upbringing very much here in India. So I have a lot to
thank India for. Now my three lessons I would like to share
with you.

First, please be a lifelong student. You know when we
were kids, we used to ask questions like Why is the sky
blueP , Why the birds flying so high? But for some reasons,
as we get older, that curiosity goes away. And if we are
happy with the knowledge we have, then we are actually
going to atrophy. So, please remain a lifelong student, don t
lose that curiosity.

Second, whatever you do, throw yourself into it, throw
your head, heart and hands into it. I look at my job not as a

WORDS AND EXPRESSIONS 1]

| Unit 6.indd 85

job, Ilook at it as a Calling, as a Passion and I don t care about
the hours, about the hardships, because to me everything is
a joy. So whatever you do, please look upon it as a Calling, a
Passion, not as a job, not as something temporary.

The third and the most important one, please help
others rise. Greatness comes not from a position, but
from helping build a future. All of us in position of power
have an obligation to pull others up. You know, as I stand
here today, I look at my responsibility not as accepting
an honour, I look upon it as accepting a challenge and a
responsibility, an obligation to actually make it possible for
people who are younger to come up and achieve levels of
greatness, so they too can be on the stage sometime in the
future.

Bhawan on 14 December 2013)

Honourable UN Secretary General Mr Ban Ki-moon,
respected President of the General Assembly Vuk Jeremic,
honourable UN envoy for global education Mr Gordon Brown,
respected elders and my dear brothers and sisters: Assalamu
alaikum.

Today it is an honour for me to be speaking again after a
long time. Being here with such honourable people is a great
moment in my life and it is an honour for me that today I
am wearing a shawl of late Benazir Bhutto. I don t know
where to begin my speech. I don t know what people would
be expecting me to say, but first of all thank you to God for
whom we all are equal and thank you to every person who
has prayed for my fast recovery and new life. I cannot believe
how much love people have shown me. I have received
thousands of good-wish cards and gifts from all over the
world. Thank you to all of them. Thank you to the children
whose innocent words encouraged me. Thank you to my
elders whose prayers strengthened me. I would like to thank
my nurses, doctors and the staff of the hospitals in Pakistan
and the UK and the UAE government who have helped me to
get better and recover my strength.
