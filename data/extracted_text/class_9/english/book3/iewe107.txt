On 3 August 1996, Leander Paes became the first Indian
to win an individual medal in 44 years when he defeated
gusto: enjoyment and Fernando Meligeni of Brazil in an exciting match in the

and clinched the bronze medal. He was given a standing

ovation when Paes raised his hand in triumph and said a
silent prayer.

Leander s father had won a bronze medal in the Munich
Olympics 1972 as a member of the Indian hockey team. It is
creditable to Leander Paes as he got it in an individual event.

Later he dedicated the medal to his coach and his
doubles teammate. They have helped me out and given
me advice and kept me in good frame of mind. This medal
doesn t just show my efforts; it shows the efforts of the whole
team. 

Paes was recognised as a prodigy by Vijay Amritraj in prodigy: a young person
the 80s. Even so, Paes true mentor has been Naresh Kumar, __ With exceptional qualities or
the former Indian Davis Cup Captain. His incredible Davis abilities
Cup record speaks for itself. While it may be said that some expatriate: a person who
of his Davis Cup victories were achieved because he was _ lives outside their native
playing on his favourite surface, grass and enjoyed home country
support. But at Atlanta, Paes had none of these advantages
except his coach, close family members and the expatriates.
While Davis Cup victories bring in good cash rewards and
ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) points, there he
was playing for just a medal. Paes explains it all when he
says, When I am playing for my country I don t expect
anything. That straightaway sets him apart.

He succeeds because of his willingness to take his
chances, swift reflexes and mental strength, and the fact
that he does not accept defeat easily.

4. An idiomatic expression is a group of words with a
special meaning. The individual words in the expression
do not mean what they otherwise stand for.

Example: Maria Sharapova cannot be pigeon-holed or
categorised. Her talent, unwavering desire to succeed
and readiness to sacrifice have lifted her to the top of
the world.

Here pigeon-holed does not mean that there is a hole
for the pigeon to its nest. But it means that someone

or something belongs to a particular type or group; is
categorised, especially without knowing much about them.

Now, consult a dictionary and match the following
idiomatic expressions given in Column A with their
meanings in Column B .

QO Ps

(UT ATS)

Your teacher or a classmate will read the excerpt given
below. Listen to it carefully and answer the questions.

Harvard-MIT researcher, Hugh Herr, is familiar with
the obstacles faced by amputees. A world-class mountain
climber at the age of 17, Herr and a friend were trapped
in a snowstorm while ascending New Hampshire s Mount
Washington in 1982. After three days without food or
camping gear, the two were rescued, but frostbite cost
Herr both his legs, which were amputated just below
the knee. Herr was fitted with prostheses, but he soon
discovered that they were developed for walking on flat
surfaces, and not for taking on advanced functions like
climbing or running. With the same determination that
he once applied to climbing, he set out to create a better
prosthetic leg. He worked with an engineering shop to
fashion his own prostheses, tinkering with customised
sockets and lighter materials. He even designed artificial
feet specially made for climbing rock (built flat and
narrow for getting a toehold in cracks and ice featuring
sharp spikes).

 I experienced a tremendous amount of pain from
prosthetic limbs at first , Herr says. So I decided to go back
to school and learn about physics and engineering to try to
solve these problems. Herr obtained a Master s degree in
mechanical engineering from MIT in 1993 and a doctorate
in biophysics from Harvard five years later.

After struggling for a decade to come up with a better
prosthetic limb, just getting the knee to market will be
a personal triumph for Herr yet another mountain
conquered. It s been a long road , he says. But I think I m
finally in a position to make a difference.
