PHYSICAL FEATURES OF INDIA

\ "ie have already learnt earlier that India

is a vast country with varied land forms.

What kind of terrain do you live in? If
you live in the plains, you are familiar with the
vast stretches of plain land. In contrast, if you
live in hilly region, the rugged terrain with
mountains and valleys are common features.
In fact, our country has practically all major
physical features of the earth, i.e., mountains,
plains, deserts, plateaus and islands.

The land of India displays great physical
variation. Geologically, the Peninsular Plateau
constitutes one of the ancient landmasses on
the earth s surface. It was supposed to be one
of the most stable land blocks. The Himalayas
and the Northern Plains are the most recent
landforms. From the view point of geology,
Himalayan mountains form an unstable zone.
The whole mountain system of Himalaya
represents a very youthful topography with
high peaks, deep valleys and fast flowing rivers.
The northern plains are formed of alluvial
deposits. The peninsular plateau is composed
of igneous and metamorphic rocks with gently
rising hills and wide valleys.

MaJor PHySIOGRAPHIC DIVISIONS

The physical features of India can be grouped
under the following physiographic divisions
(Figure 2.2):

(1) The Himalayan Mountains
(2) The Northern Plains

(3) The Peninsular Plateau

(4) The Indian Desert

(5) The Coastal Plains

(6) The Islands

The Himalayan Mountains

The Himalayas, geologically young and
structurally fold mountains stretch over the
northern borders of India. These mountain
ranges run in a west-east direction from the
Indus to the Brahmaputra. The Himalayas
represent the loftiest and one of the most
rugged mountain barriers of the world. They
form an arc, which covers a distance of about
2,400 Km. Their width varies from 400 Km in
Kashmir to 150 Km in Arunachal Pradesh. The
altitudinal variations are greater in the eastern
half than those in the western half. The
Himalaya consists of three parallel ranges in
its longitudinal extent. A number of valleys lie
between these ranges. The northern-most
range is known as the Great or Inner
Himalayas or the Himadri. It is the most
continuous range consisting of the loftiest
peaks with an average height of
6,000 metres. It contains all prominent
Himalayan peaks.

The range lying to the south of the
Himadri forms the most rugged mountain
system and is known as Himachal or lesser
Himalaya. The ranges are mainly composed
of highly compressed and altered rocks. The
altitude varies between 3,700 and 4,500
metres and the average width is of 50 Km.
While the Pir Panjal range forms the longest
and the most important range, the Dhaula
Dhar and the Mahabharat ranges are also
prominent ones. This range consists of the
famous valley of Kashmir, the Kangra and
Kullu Valley in Himachal Pradesh. This
region is well-known for its hill stations.

of 10-50 Km and have an altitude varying
between 900 and 1100 metres. These ranges
are composed of unconsolidated sediments
brought down by rivers from the main
Himalayan ranges located farther north.
These valleys are covered with thick
gravel and alluvium. The longitudinal valley
lying between lesser Himalaya and the
Shiwaliks are known as Duns. Dehra Dun,
Kotli Dun and Patli Dun are some of the
well-known Duns.

Besides the longitudinal divisions, the
Himalayas have been divided on the basis of
regions from west to east. These divisions
have been demarcated by river valleys. For
example, the part of Himalayas lying between
Indus and Satluj has been traditionally
known as Punjab Himalaya but it is also
known regionally as Kashmir and Himachal
Himalaya from west to east respectively. The
part of the Himalayas lying between Satluj
and Kali rivers is known as Kumaon
Himalayas. The Kali and Teesta rivers
demarcate the Nepal Himalayas and the part
lying between Teesta and Dihang rivers is
known as Assam Himalayas. There are
regional names also in these broad
categories. Find out some regional names of
the Himalayas

The Brahmaputra marks the eastern-most
boundary of the Himalayas. Beyond the Dihang
gorge, the Himalayas bend sharply to the south
and spread along the eastern boundary of
India. They are known as the Purvachal or the
Eastern hills and mountains. These hills
running through the north-eastern states are
mostly composed of strong sandstones, which
are sedimentary rocks. Covered with dense
forests, they mostly run as parallel ranges
and valleys. The Purvachal comprises the
Patkai hills, the Naga hills, the Manipur hills
and the Mizo hills.

The Northern Plain

The northern plain has been formed by the
interplay of the three major river systems,
namely the Indus, the Ganga and the
Brahmaputra along with their tributaries. This
plain is formed of alluvial soil. The deposition
of alluvium in a vast basin lying at the foothills
of the Himalaya over millions of years, formed
this fertile plain. It spreads over an area of 7
lakh sq. km. The plain being about 2400 km
long and 240 to 320 km broad, is a densely
populated physiographic division. With a rich
soil cover combined with adequate water
supply and favourable climate it is
agriculturally a productive part of India.

Figure 2.5 : The Northern Plains

The rivers coming from northern
mountains are involved in depositional work.
In the lower course, due to gentle slope, the
velocity of the river decreases, which results in
the formation of riverine islands.

Do You Know: Majuli, in the Brahmaputra
river, is the largest inhabited riverine island in the
world.

The rivers in their lower course split into

numerous channels due to the deposition of silt.
These channels are known as distributaries.

PHYSICAL FEATURES OF INDIA

The Northern Plain is broadly divided into
three sections. The Western part of the Northern
Plain is referred to as the Punjab Plains.
Formed by the Indus and its tributaries, the
larger part of this plain lies in Pakistan. The
Indus and its tributaries the Jhelum, the
Chenab, the Ravi, the Beas and the Satluj
originate in the Himalaya. This section of the
plain is dominated by the doabs.
Do You Know: Doab is made up of two words
 do meaning two and ab meaning water. Similarly
 Punjab , is also made up two words Punj meaning
five and ab meaning water.

The Ganga plain extends between Ghaggar
and Teesta rivers. It is spread over North India in
Haryana, Delhi, U.P., Bihar, partly Jharkhand and
West Bengal. In the East, particularly in Assam
lies the Brahmaputra plain.

The northern plains are generally described
as flat land with no variations in its relief. It is
not true. These vast plains also have diverse
relief features. According to the variations in
relief features, the Northern plains can be
divided into four regions. The rivers, after
descending from the mountains deposit
pebbles in a narrow belt of about 8 to 16 km
in width lying parallel to the slopes of the
Shiwaliks. It is known as bhabar. All the
streams disappear in this bhabar belt. South
of this belt, the streams and rivers re-emerge
and create a wet, swampy and marshy region
known as terai. This was a thickly forested
region full of wildlife. The forests have been
cleared to create agricultural land and to settle
migrants from Pakistan after partition. Locate
Dudhwa National Park in this region.

The largest part of the northern plain is
formed of older alluvium. It lies above the
floodplains of the rivers and presents a terracelike feature. This part is known as bhangar.
The soil in this region contains calcareous
deposits, locally known as kankar. The
Reprint 2025-26

newer, younger deposits of the floodplains
are called khadar. They are renewed almost
every year and so are fertile, thus, ideal for
intensive agriculture.

The Peninsular Plateau

The Peninsular plateau is a tableland
composed of the old crystalline, igneous and
metamorphic rocks. It was formed due to the
breaking and drifting of the Gondwana land
and thus, making it a part of the oldest
landmass. The plateau has broad and shallow
valleys and rounded hills. This plateau consists
of two broad divisions, namely, the Central
Highlands and the Deccan Plateau. The part
of the Peninsular plateau lying to the north of
the Narmada river, covering a major area of the
Malwa plateau, is known as the Central
Highlands. The Vindhyan range is bounded
by the Satpura range on the south and the
Aravalis on the northwest. The further
westward extension gradually merges with the
sandy and rocky desert of Rajasthan. The
flow of the rivers draining this region, namely
the Chambal, the Sind, the Betwa and the Ken
is from southwest to northeast, thus indicating
the slope. The Central Highlands are wider in
the west but narrower in the east. The eastward
extensions of this plateau are locally known
as the Bundelkhand and Baghelkhand.

tm
Figure 2.6 : A Waterfall in Chotanagpur Plateau
The Chotanagpur plateau marks the
further eastward extension, drained by the
Damodar river.

The Deccan Plateau is a triangular landmass
that lies to the south of the river Narmada. The
Satpura range flanks its broad base in the north,
while the Mahadev, the Kaimur hills and the
Maikal range form its eastern extensions. Locate
these hills and ranges in the Physical map of
India. The Deccan Plateau is higher in the west
and slopes gently eastwards. An extension of the
Plateau is also visible in the northeast, locally
known as the Meghalaya, Karbi-Anglong Plateau
and North Cachar Hills. It is separated by a fault
from the Chotanagpur Plateau. Three prominent
hill ranges from the west to the east are the Garo,
the Khasi and the Jaintia Hills.

The Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats
mark the western and the eastern edges of the
Deccan Plateau respectively. Western Ghats lie
parallel to the western coast. They are continuous
and can be crossed through passes only. Locate
the Thal, Bhor and Pal Ghats in the Physical
map of India.

The Western Ghats are higher than the
Eastern Ghats. Their average elevation is 9001600 metres as against 600 metres of the
Eastern Ghats. The Eastern Ghats stretch
from the Mahanadi Valley to the Nigiris in the
south. The Eastern Ghats are discontinuous
and irregular and dissected by rivers draining
into the Bay of Bengal. The Western Ghats
cause orographic rain by facing the rain
bearing moist winds to rise along the western
slopes of the Ghats. The Western Ghats are
known by different local names. The height of
the Western Ghats progressively increases
from north to south. The highest peaks
include the Anai Mudi (2,695 metres) and the
Doda Betta (2,637 metres). Mahendragiri
(1,501 metres) is the highest peak in the
Eastern Ghats. Shevroy Hills and the Javadi
Hills are located to the southeast of the

CONTEMPORARY INDIA-I

Eastern Ghats. Locate the famous hill stations
of Udagamandalam, popularly known as
Ooty and the Kodaikanal.

One of the distinct features of the
Peninsular plateau is the black soil area
known as Decean Trap. This is of volcanic
origin, hence, the rocks are igneous. Actually,
these rocks have denuded over time and are
responsible for the formation of black soil. The
Aravali Hills lie on the western and
northwestern margins of the Peninsular
plateau. These are highly eroded hills and are
found as broken hills. They extend from
Gujarat to Delhi in a southwest-northeast
direction.

The Indian Desert

The Indian desert lies towards the western
margins of the Aravali Hills. It is an undulating
sandy plain covered with sand dunes. This
region receives very low rainfall below 150 mm
per year. It has arid climate with low vegetation
cover. Streams appear during the rainy
season. Soon after they disappear into the
sand as they do not have enough water to
reach the sea. Luni is the only large river in
this region.

more prominent near the Indo-Pakistan
boundary. If you visit Jaisalmer, you may go
to see a group of barchans.

The Coastal Plains

The Peninsular plateau is flanked by stretch
of narrow coastal strips, running along the
Arabian Sea on the west and the Bay of Bengal
on the east. The western coast, sandwiched
between the Western Ghats and the Arabian
Sea, is a narrow plain. It consists of three
sections. The northern part of the coast is called
the Konkan (Mumbai - Goa), the central stretch
is called the Kannad Plain, while the southern
stretch is referred to as the Malabar coast.

Figure 2.8 : The Coastal Plains

The plains along the Bay of Bengal are wide
and level. In the northern part, it is referred to
as the Northern Circar, while the southern part
is known as the Coromandel Coast. Large
rivers, such as the Mahanadi, the Godavari,
the Krishna and the Kaveri have formed
extensive delta on this coast. Lake Chilika is
an important feature along the eastern coast.

Do You Kno ?
The Chilika Lake is the
largest salt water lake in India. It lies in the state
of Odisha, to the south of the Mahanadi delta.

The Islands

You have already seen that India has a vast
mainland. Besides this, the country has two groups
of islands. Can you identify these island groups?

Figure 2.9: AnIsland

Locate the Lakshadweep Islands group
lying close to the Malabar coast of Kerala. This
group of islands is composed of small coral
isalnds. Earlier they were known as Laccadive,
Minicoy and Amindive. In 1973, these were
named as Lakshadweep. It covers small area
of 32 sq km. Kavaratti island is the
administrative headquarters of Lakshadweep.
This island group has great diversity of flora

north to south. These are Andaman and
Nicobar islands. They are bigger in size and
are more numerous and scattered. The entire
group of islands is divided into two broad
categories The Andaman in the north and
the Nicobar in the south. It is believed that these
islands are an elevated portion of submarine
mountains. These island groups are of great
strategic importance for the country. There is
great diversity of flora and fauna in this group
of islands too. These islands lie close to equator
and experience equatorial climate and has
thick forest cover.

Do You Know? ; ; ;

India s only active volcano is
found on Barren island in Andaman and Nicobar

A detailed account of the different
physiographic units highlights the unique
features of each region. It would, however,
be clear that each region complements the
other and makes the country richer in its
natural resources. The mountains are the
major sources of water and forest wealth.
The northern plains are the granaries of the
country. They provide the base for early
civilisations. The plateau is a storehouse
of minerals, which has played a crucial role
in the industrialisation of the country. The
coastal region and island groups provide
sites for fishing and port activities. Thus,
the diverse physical features of the land
have immense future possibilities
of development.
