CHAPTER 3

ELECTORAL
POLITICS

OVERVIEW

In Chapter 1 we have seen that in a democracy it is neither possible nor
necessary for people to govern directly. The most common form of
democracy in our times is for the people to govern through their
representatives. In this chapter we will look at how these representatives
are elected. We begin by understanding why elections are necessary and
useful in a democracy. We try to understand how electoral competition
among parties serves the people. We then go on to ask what makes an
election democratic. The basic idea here is to distinguish democratic
elections from non-democratic elections.

The rest of the chapter tries to assess elections in India in the light of
this yardstick. We take a look at each stage of elections, from the drawing
of boundaries of different constituencies to the declaration of results. At
each stage we ask what should happen and what does happen in elections.
Towards the end of the chapter, we turn to an assessment of whether
elections in India are free and fair. Here we also examine the role of the
Election Commission in ensuring free and fair elections.

Assembly Election in
Haryana

The time is after midnight. An expectant
crowd sitting for the past five hours in a
chowk of the town is waiting for its leader
to come. The organisers assure and reassure the crowd that he would be here any
moment. The crowd stands up whenever
a passing vehicle comes that way. It
arouses hopes that he has come.

The leader is Mr. Devi Lal, chief of
the Haryana Sangharsh Samiti, who was
to address a meeting in Karnal on Thursday night. The 76-year-old leader, is a
very busy man these days. His day starts
at 8 a.m. and ends after 11 p.m. ... he
had already addressed nine election
meetings since morning... been constantly addressing public meetings for
the past 23 months and preparing for this
election.

This newspaper report is about the
State assembly election in Haryana
in 1987. The State had been ruled by
a Congress party led government
since 1982. Chaudhary Devi Lal, then
an opposition leader, led a movement
called Nyaya Yudh (Struggle for
Justice) and formed a new party, Lok
Dal. His party joined other opposition
parties to form a front against the
Congress in the elections. In the
election campaign, Devi Lal said that
if his party won the elections, his

government would waive the loans
of farmers and small businessmen.
He promised that this would be the
first action of his government.

The people were unhappy with the
existing government. They were also
attracted by Devi Lal s promise. So,
when elections were held, they voted
overwhelmingly in favour of Lok Dal
and its allies. Lok Dal and its
partners won 76 out of 90 seats in
the State Assembly. Lok Dal alone
won 60 seats and thus had a clear
majority in the Assembly. The
Congress could win only 5 seats.

Once the election results were
announced, the sitting Chief
Minister resigned. The newly elected
Members of Legislative Assembly
(MLAs) of Lok Dal chose Devi Lal as
their leader. The Governor invited
Devi Lal to be the new Chief
Minister. Three days after the
election results were declared, he
became the Chief Minister. As soon
as he became the Chief Minister, his
Government issued a Government
Order waiving the outstanding loans
of small farmers, agricultural
labourers and small businessmen.
His party ruled the State for four
years. The next elections were held
in 1991. But this time his party did
not win popular support. The
Congress won the election and
formed the government.

Jagdeep and Navpreet read this story and drew the following conclusions. Can you say which of
these are right or wrong (or if the information given in the story is inadequate to call them right or

wrong):

= Elections can lead to changes in the policy of the government.
= The Governor invited Devi Lal to become the Chief Minister because he was impressed with his

speeches.

= People are unhappy with every ruling party and vote against it in the next election.
= The party that wins the election forms the government.

= This election led to a lot of economic development in Haryana.

= The Congress Chief Minister need not have resigned after his party lost elections.

ACTIVITY

Do you know when the last Assembly election
was held in your state? Which other elections

Why do we need elections?
Elections take place regularly in
any democracy. There are more than
one hundred countries in the world
in which elections take place to
choose people s representatives. We
also read that elections are held in
many countries that are not
democratic.

But why do we need elections?
Let us try to imagine a democracy
without elections. A rule of the
people is possible without any
elections if all the people can sit
together everyday and take all the
decisions. But as we have already
seen in Chapter 1, this is not
possible in any large community.
Nor is it possible for everyone to
have the time and knowledge to
take decisions on all matters.
Therefore in most democracies
people rule through their
representatives.

Is there a democratic way of
selecting representatives without
elections? Let us think of a place
where representatives are selected
on the basis of age and experience.
Or a place where they are chosen
on the basis of education or
knowledge. There could be some
difficulty in deciding on who is more
experienced or knowledgable. But let
us say the people can resolve these
difficulties. Clearly, such a place
does not require elections.

But can we call this place a
democracy? How do we find out if
the people like their representatives
or not? How do we ensure that these
representatives rule as per the
wishes of the people? How to make
sure that those who the people don t
like do not remain _ their
representatives? This requires a
mechanism by which people can
choose their representatives at
regular intervals and change them
if they wish to do so. This
mechanism is called election.
Therefore, elections are considered
essential in our times for any
representative democracy.
In an election the voters make
many choices:
= They can choose who will make
laws for them.
= They can choose who will form the
government and take major
decisions.

= They can choose the party whose
policies will guide the government
and law making.

What makes an election
democratic?
Elections can be held in many ways.
All democratic countries hold
elections. But most non-democratic
countries also hold some kind of
elections. How do we distinguish
democratic elections from any other
election? We have discussed this
question briefly in Chapter 1. We
discussed many examples of
countries where elections are held
but they can t really be called
democratic elections. Let us recall
what we learnt there and start with
a simple list of the minimum
conditions of a democratic election:
a First, everyone should be able to
choose. This means that everyone
should have one vote and every
vote should have equal value.

DEMOCRATIC POLITICS

Reprint 2025-26

We have seen why
democracies need
to have elections.
But why do rulers
in non-democratic
countries need to
hold elections?

Ah! So, elections
are like exams
where politicians
and parties know if
they have passed
or failed. But who
are the examiners?

aSecond, there should _ be
something to choose from. Parties
and candidates should be free to
contest elections and should offer
some real choice to the voters.

= Third, the choice should be offered
at regular intervals. Elections must
be held regularly after every few
years.

= Fourth, the candidate preferred by
the people should get elected.

a Fifth, elections should be
conducted in a free and fair
manner where people can choose
as they really wish.

These might look like very simple
and easy conditions. But there are
many countries where these are not
fulfilled. In this chapter we will apply
these conditions to the elections held
in our own country to see if we can
call these democratic elections.

Is it good to_have political
competition?

Elections are thus all about political
competition. This competition takes
various forms. The most obvious form
is the competition among political
parties. At the constituency level, it
takes the form of competition among
several candidates. If there is no
competition, elections will become
pointless.

But is it good to have political
competition? Clearly, an electoral
competition has many demerits. It
creates a sense of disunity and
 factionalism in every locality. You
would have heard of people
complaining of party-politics in your
locality. Different political parties and
leaders often level allegations against
one another. Parties and candidates
often use dirty tricks to win elections.
Some people say that this pressure
to win electoral fights does not allow
sensible long-term policies to be
formulated. Some good people who

ELECTORAL POLITICS

Reprint 2025-26

may wish to serve the country do not
enter this arena. They do not like the
idea of being dragged into unhealthy
competition.

Our Constitution makers were
aware of these problems. Yet they
opted for free competition in
elections as the way to select our
future leaders. They did so because
this system works better in the long
run. In an ideal world all political
leaders know what is good for the
people and are motivated only by a
desire to serve them. Political
competition is not necessary in such
an ideal world. But that is not what
happens in real life. Political leaders
all over the world, like all other
professionals, are motivated by a
desire to advance their political
careers. They want to remain in
power or get power and positions for
themselves.They may wish to serve
the people as well, but it is risky to
depend entirely on their sense of
duty. Besides even when they wish
to serve the people, they may not
know what is required to do so, or
their ideas may not match what the
people really want.

How do we deal with this real life
situation? One way is to try and
improve the knowledge and character
of political leaders. The other and
more realistic way is to set up a
system where political leaders are
rewarded for serving the people and
punished for not doing so. Who
decides this reward or punishment?
The simple answer is: the people.
This is what electoral competition
does. Regular electoral competition
provides incentives to political
parties and leaders. They know that
if they raise issues that people want
to be raised, their popularity and
chances of victory will increase in
the next elections. But if they fail to
satisfy the voters with their work
they will not be able to win again.

So if a political party is motivated
only by desire to be in power, even
then it will be forced to serve the
people. This is a bit like the way
market works. Even if a shopkeeper
is interested only in his profit, he is
forced to give good service to the

Irfan Khan

customers. If he does not, the
customer will go to some other shop.
Similarly, political competition may
cause divisions and some ugliness,
but it finally helps to force political
parties and leaders to serve the
people.

3.2 Wuat Is Our SYSTEM OF ELECTIONS?

Can we say that Indian elections are
democratic? To answer this question,
let us take a look at how elections are
held in India. Lok Sabha and Vidhan
Sabha (Assembly) elections are held
regularly after every five years. After
five years the term of all the elected
representatives comes to an end. The
Lok Sabha or Vidhan Sabha stands
 dissolved . Elections are held in all
constituencies at the same time,
either on the same day or within a
few days. This is called a general
election. Sometimes election is held
only for one constitutency to fill the
vacancy caused by death or
resignation of a member. This is

called a by-election. In this chapter
we will focus on general elections.

Electoral constituencies

You read about the people of
Haryana electing 90 MLAs. You may
have wondered how they did that.
Did every person in Haryana vote for
all the 90 MLAs? You perhaps know
that this is not the case. In our
country we follow an area based
system of representation. The
country is divided into different
areas for purposes of elections.
These areas are called electoral
constitutencies. The voters who live
in an area elect one representative.

DEMOCRATIC POLITICS

Reprint 2025-26

For Lok Sabha elections, the country
is divided into 543 constituencies.
The representative elected from each
constituency is called a Member of
Parliament or an MP. One of the
features of a democratic election is
that every vote should have equal
value. That is why our Constitution
requires that each constituency
should have a roughly equal
population living within it.
Similarly, each state is divided into
a specific number of Assembly
constituencies. In this case, the
elected representative is called the
Member of Legislative Assembly or
an MLA. Each Parliamentary

constituency has within it several
assembly constituencies. The same
principle applies for Panchayat and
Municipal elections. Each village or
town is divided into several wards 
that are like constituencies. Each
ward elects one member of the
village or the urban local body.
Sometimes these constituencies are
counted as seats , for each
constituency represents one seat in
the assembly. When we say that Lok
Dal won 60 seats in Haryana, it
means that candidates of Lok Dal
won in 60 assembly constituencies
in the state and thus Lok Dal had
60 MLAs in the state assembly.

Reserved Constituencies
Our Constitution entitles every
citizen to elect her/his representative
and to be elected as a representative.
The Constitution makers, however,
were worried that in an open
electoral competition, certain
weaker sections may not stand a good
chance to get elected to the Lok Sabha
and the state Legislative Assemblies.
They may not have the required
resources, education and contacts to
contest and win elections against
others. Those who are influential and
resourceful may prevent them from
winning elections. If that happens,
our Parliament and Assemblies
would be deprived of the voice of a
significant section of our population.
That would make our democracy less
representative and less democratic.
So, the makers of our Constitution
thought of a special system of
reserved constituencies for the
weaker sections. Some constituencies
are reserved for people who belong
to the Scheduled Castes [SC] and
Scheduled Tribes [ST]. In a SC
reserved constituency only someone
who belongs to the Scheduled
Castes can stand for election.
Similarly only those belonging to the
Scheduled Tribes can contest an
election from a constituency
reserved for ST. Currently, in the
Lok Sabha, 84 seats are reserved for
the Scheduled Castes and 47 for the
Scheduled Tribes (as on 26 January
2019). This number is in proportion
to their share in the total population.
Thus the reserved seats for SC and
ST do not take away the legitimate
share of any other social group.
This system of reservation
was extended later to other
weaker sections at the district and
local level. In many states, seats
in rural (panchayat) and urban
(municipalities and corporations)

local bodies are now reserved for
Other Backward Classes (OBC) as
well. However, the proportion of
seats reserved varies from state to
state. Similarly, one-third of the
seats are reserved in rural and
urban local bodies for women
candidates.

Voters list

Once the constituencies are decided,
the next step is to decide who can
and who cannot vote. This decision
cannot be left to anyone till the last
day. In a democratic election, the list
of those who are eligible to vote
is prepared much before the
election and given to everyone. This
list is officially called the Electoral
Roll and is commonly known as the
Voters List.

This is an important step for it is
linked to the first condition of a
democratic election: everyone
should get an equal opportunity to
choose representatives. Earlier, we
read about the principle of
universal adult franchise. In
practice it means that everyone
should have one vote and each vote
should have equal value. No one
should be denied the right to vote
without a good reason. Different
citizens differ from one another in
many ways: some are rich, some are
poor; some are highly educated,
some are not so educated or not
educated at all; some are kind,
others are not so kind. But all of
them are human beings with their
own needs and views. That is why
all of them deserve to have an equal
say in decisions that affect them.

In our country, all the citizens aged
18 years and above can vote in an
election. Every citizen has the right
to vote, regardless of his or her caste,
religion or gender. Some criminals
and persons with unsound mind can

be denied the right to vote, but only
in rare situations. It is the
responsibility of the government to
get the names of all the eligible
voters put on the voters list. As new
persons attain voting age names are
added to the voters list. Names of
those who move out of a place or
those who are dead are deleted. A
complete revision of the list takes
place every five years. This is done
to ensure that it remains up to date.
In the last few years a new system
of Election Photo Identity Card
[EPIC] has been introduced. The
government has tried to give this
card to every person on the voters
list. The voters are required to carry
this card when they go out to vote,
so that no one can vote for someone
else. But the card is not yet
compulsory for voting. For voting,
the voters can show many other
proofs of identity like the ration card
or the driving licence.

Nomination of candidates
We noted above that in a democratic
election people should have a real
choice. This happens only when
there are almost no restrictions on
anyone to contest an election. This
is what our system provides. Anyone who can be a voter can also become a candidate in elections. The
only difference is that in order to be
a candidate the minimum age is 25
years, while it is only 18 years for
being a voter. There are some other
restrictions on criminals etc. but
these apply in very extreme cases.
Political parties nominate their candidates who get the party symbol
and support. Party s nomination is
often called party ticket .

Every person who wishes to
contest an election has to fill a
 nomination form and give some
money as security deposit .

Recently, a new system of

declaration has been introduced on

direction from the Supreme Court.

Every candidate has to make a legal

declaration, giving full details of :

= Serious criminal cases pending
against the candidate;

= Details of the assets and liabilities
of the candidate and his or her
family; and

= Educational qualifications of the
candidate.

This information has to be made
public. This provides an opportunity
to the voters to make their decision
on the basis of the information
provided by the candidates.

Educational qualifications for
candidates

Why is there no educational qualification for
holding such an important position when some
kind of educational qualification is needed for any
other job in the country?

= Educational qualifications are not relevant to
all kinds of jobs. The relevant qualification for
selection to the Indian cricket team, for
example, is not the attainment of educational
degrees but the ability to play cricket well.
Similarly the relevant qualification for being an
MLA or an MP is the ability to understand
people s concerns, problems and to represent
their interests. Whether they can do so or not
is examined by lakhs of examiners their
voters after every five years.

Even if education was relevant, it should be
left to the people to decide how much
importance they give to educational
qualifications.

In our country putting an educational
qualification would go against the spirit of
democracy for yet another reason. It would
mean depriving a majority of the country s
citizens the right to contest elections. If, for
example, a graduate degree like B.A., B.Com
or B.Sc was made compulsory for candidates,
more than 90 per cent of the citizens will
become ineligible to contest elections.

Election Campaign

The main purpose of election is to
give people a chance to choose the
representatives, the government and
the policies they prefer. Therefore it
is necessary to have a free and open
discussion about who is a better
representative, which party will
make a better government or what
is a good policy. This is what happens
during election campaigns.

In our country such campaigns
take place for a two-week period
between the announcement of the
final list of candidates and the date
of polling. During this period the
candidates contact their voters,
political leaders address election
meetings and political parties
mobilise their supporters. This is
also the period when newspapers
and television news are full of
election related stories and debates.

But election campaign is not limited
to these two weeks only. Political
parties start preparing for elections
months before they actually take
place.

ACTIVITY

How was the election campaign in your

In election campaigns, political
parties try to focus public attention on
some big issues. They want to attract
the public to that issue and get them
to vote for their party on that basis. Let
us look at some of the successful
slogans given by different political
parties in various elections.
= The Congress party led by Indira

Gandhi gave the slogan of Garibi

Hatao (Remove poverty) in the

Lok Sabha elections of 1971. The

party promised to reorient all the

policies of the government to
remove poverty from the country.
= Save Democracy was the slogan
given by Janata Party under the
leadership of Jayaprakash Narayan,
in the Lok Sabha election held in

1977. The party promised to undo

the excesses committed during

Emergency and restore civil

liberties.

a The Left Front used the slogan of
Land to the Tiller in the West
Bengal Assembly elections held in
1977.

= Protect the Self-Respect of the
Telugus was the slogan used by N.
T. Rama Rao, the leader of the
Telugu Desam Party in Andhra
Pradesh Assembly elections in
1983.

In a democracy it is best to leave
political parties and candidates free
to conduct their election campaigns
the way they want to. But it is

Polling and counting of votes
The final stage of an election is the
day when the voters cast or poll 
their vote. That day is usually called
the election day. Every person whose
name is on the voters list can go to
a nearby polling booth , situated
usually in a local school or a
government office. Once the voter
goes inside the booth, the election
officials identify her, put a mark on
her finger and allow her to cast her
vote. An agent of each candidate is
allowed to sit inside the polling
booth and ensure that the voting
takes place in a fair way.

Ar lections too expensive
rahe

r country?

Ale amount of money is spent in conducting
elections in India. For instance, the government
spent about %3,500 crores in conducting Lok Sabha
elections in 2014. That works out to about 40 per
person on the voters list. The amount spent by
parties and candidates was more than what the
government spent. Roughly speaking, the
expenditure made by government, parties and
candidates was around %30,000 crores or 500
per voter.

Some people say that elections are a burden
on our people, that our poor country cannot afford
to hold elections once every five years. Let us
compare this expenditure with some other figures:
= In 2005, our government decided to buy six

nuclear submarines from France. Each subma
rine cost about 3,000 crores.
= Delhi hosted the Commonwealth Games in

2010. The estimate for its cost is around

%20,000 crores.

Are the elections too expensive? You decide.

Election result in Gulbarga

Let us go back to our example of Gulbarga. In 2014, a total of 8 candidates contested elections in that
constituency. The total eligible voters were 17.21 lakhs. Of these 9.98 lakh voters had cast their votes.
The candidate of the Congress party, Mallikarjun Kharge secured about 5.07 lakh votes. This was 50.82
percent of the total votes polled. But since he had secured more votes than anyone else, he was

declared elected a Member of Parliament from Gulbarga Lok Sabha constituency.

Earlier the voters used to indicate
who they wanted to vote for by putting
a stamp on the ballot paper. A ballot
paper is a sheet of paper on which
the names of the contesting
candidates along with party name
and symbols are listed. Nowadays
electronic voting machines (EVM) are
used to record votes. The machine
shows the names of the candidates
and the party symbols. Independent
candidates too have their own
symbols, allotted by election commission.
All that the voter has to do is to press
the button against the name of the
candidate she wants to give her vote.

Once the polling is over, all the
EVMs are sealed and taken to a

secure place. A few days later, on a
fixed date, all the EVMs from a
constituency are opened and the
votes secured by each candidate are
counted. The agents of all candidates
are present there to ensure that the
counting is done properly. The
candidate who secures the highest
number of votes from a constituency
is declared elected. In a general
election, usually the counting of votes
in all the constituencies takes place
at the same time, on the same day.
Television channels, radio and
newspapers report this event. Within
a few hours of counting, all the results
are declared and it becomes clear as
to who will form the next government.

Identify the fair and the unfair electoral practices among the following:

= Aminister flags off a new train in his constituency a week before polling day.

= Acandidate promises that she will get a new train for her constituency if she is elected.

= Supporters of a candidate take the voters to a temple and make them take an oath that they

will vote for him.

= The supporters of a candidate distribute blankets in slums in return for a promise for vote.

agents present in
the polling booth
and the counting

3.3 WHAT MAKES ELECTIONS IN INDIA

DEMOCRATIC?

We get to read a lot about unfair

practices in elections. Newspapers

and television reports often refer to

such allegations. Most of these

reports are about the following:

aInclusion of false names and
exclusion of genuine names in the
voters list;

=a Misuse of government facilities
and officials by the ruling party;

= Excessive use of money by rich
candidates and big parties; and

= Intimidation of voters and rigging
on the polling day.

Many of these reports are correct.
We feel unhappy when we read or
see such reports. But fortunately
they are not on such a scale so as to
defeat the very purpose of elections.
This becomes clear if we ask a basic
question: Can a party win an
election and come to power not
because it has popular support but
through electoral malpractices? This
is a vital question. Let us carefully
examine various aspects of this
question.

Independent Election
Commission

One simple way of checking whether
elections are fair or not is to look at
who conducts the elections. Are they
independent of the government? Or
can the government or the ruling party
influence or pressurise them? Do they
have enough powers to be able to
conduct free and fair elections? Do
they actually use these powers?

The answer to all these questions
is quite positive for our country. In
our country elections are conducted
by an independent and very powerful
Election Commission (EC). It enjoys
the same kind of independence that
the judiciary enjoys. The Chief

ELECTORAL POLITICS

Reprint 2025-26

Election Commissioner (CEC) is

appointed by the President of India.

But once appointed, the Chief

Election Commissioner is not

answerable to the President or the

government. Even if the ruling party
or the government does not like what
the Commission does, it is virtually
impossible for it to remove the CEC.

Very few election commissions in
the world have such wide-ranging
powers as the Election Commission
of India.
= EC takes decisions on every aspect

of conduct and control of elections

from the announcement of
elections to the declaration of
results.

alt implements the Code of
Conduct and punishes any
candidate or party that violates it.

= During the election period, the EC
can order the government to follow
some guidelines, to prevent use
and misuse of governmental power
to enhance its chances to win
elections, or to transfer some
government officials.

a When on election duty, government officers work under the control of the EC and not the government.

In the last 25 years or so, the
Election Commission has begun to
exercise all its powers and even
expand them. It is very common now
for the Election Commission to
reprimand the government and
administration for their lapses. When
election officials come to the opinion
that polling was not fair in some booths
or even an entire constituency, they
order a repoll. The ruling parties often
do not like what the EC does. But they
have to obey. This would not have
happened if the EC was not
independent and powerful.

instance to ensure free and fair elections.

outcome

One final test of the free and fairness
of election has in the outcome itself.
If elections are not free or fair, the
outcome always favours the powerful.
In such a situation, the ruling parties
do not lose elections. Usually, the

losing party does not accept the

outcome of a rigged election.
The outcome of India s elections

speaks for itself:

= The ruling parties routinely lose
elections in India both at the
national and state level. In fact in
every two out of the three elections
held in the last 25 years, the
ruling party lost.

= In the US, an incumbent or sitting 
elected representative rarely loses
an election. In India about half of
the sitting MPs or MLAs lose
elections.

= Candidates who are known to have
spent a lot of money on buying
votes and those with known
criminal connections often lose
elections.

= Candidates and parties with a lot
of money may not be sure of their
victory but they do enjoy a big and
unfair advantage over smaller
parties and independents.

aIn some parts of the country,

the electoral race and to secure a
 ticket from major parties.

a Smaller parties and independent
candidates suffer a huge
disadvantage compared to bigger
parties.

These challenges exist not just in
India but also in many established
democracies. These deeper issues
are a matter of concern for those who
believe in democracy. That is why
citizens, social activists and
organisations have been demanding
reforms in our electoral system. Can
you think of some reforms? What
can an ordinary citizen do to face
these challenges?

Here are some facts on Indian elections. Comment on each of these to say whether they reflect the

strength or the weakness of our electoral system:

= The 16th Lok Sabha has 12 per cent women members.
= The Election Commission often refuses to accept the government s advice about when the elections

should be held.

= The 16th Lok Sabha has more than 440 members whose assets are more than Rs.1 crore.
= After losing an election the Chief Minister said: I respect the people s verdict .
