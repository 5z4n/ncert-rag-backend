Chapter3

Ancient Indian and Greek philosophers have
always wondered about the unknown and
unseen form of matter. The idea of divisibility
of matter was considered long back in India,
around 500 BC. An Indian philosopher
Maharishi Kanad, postulated that if we go on
dividing matter (padarth), we shall get smaller
and smaller particles. Ultimately, a stage will
come when we shall come across the smallest
particles beyond which further division will
not be possible. He named these particles
Parmanu. Another Indian philosopher,
Pakudha Katyayama, elaborated this doctrine
and said that these particles normally exist
in a combined form which gives us various
forms of matter.

Around the same era, ancient Greek
philosophers Democritus and Leucippus
suggested that if we go on dividing matter, a
stage will come when particles obtained
cannot be divided further. Democritus called
these indivisible particles atoms (meaning
indivisible). All this was based on
philosophical considerations and not much
experimental work to validate these ideas
could be done till the eighteenth century.

By the end of the eighteenth century,
scientists recognised the difference between
elements and compounds and naturally
became interested in finding out how and why
elements combine and what happens when
they combine.

Antoine L. Lavoisier laid the foundation
of chemical sciences by establishing two
important laws of chemical combination.

3.1 Laws of Chemical Combination

The following two laws of chemical
combination were established after

much experimentations by Lavoisier and
Joseph L. Proust.

3.1.1 LAW OF CONSERVATION OF MASS

solutions X and Y get mixed.

e What happens in the reaction flask?

e Do you think that a chemical reaction
has taken place?

e Why should we put a cork on the mouth
of the flask?

e Does the mass of the flask and its
contents change?

Law of conservation of mass states that
mass can neither be created nor destroyed in
a chemical reaction.

3.1.2 Law OF CONSTANT PROPORTIONS

Lavoisier, along with other scientists, noted
that many compounds were composed of two
or more elements and each such compound
had the same elements in the same
proportions, irrespective of where the
compound came from or who prepared it.

In acompound such as water, the ratio of
the mass of hydrogen to the mass of oxygen is
always 1:8, whatever the source of water. Thus,
if 9 g of water is decomposed, 1 g of hydrogen
and 8 g of oxygen are always obtained.
Similarly in ammonia, nitrogen and hydrogen
are always present in the ratio 14:3 by mass,
whatever the method or the source from which
itis obtained.

This led to the law of constant proportions
which is also known as the law of definite
proportions. This law was stated by Proust as
 In a chemical substance the elements are
always present in definite proportions by
mass .

The next problem faced by scientists was
to give appropriate explanations of these laws.
British chemist John Dalton provided the
basic theory about the nature of matter.
Dalton picked up the idea of divisibility of
matter, which was till then just a philosophy.
He took the name atoms as given by the
Greeks and said that the smallest particles of
matter are atoms. His theory was based on the
laws of chemical combination. Dalton s atomic
theory provided an explanation for the law of

ATOMS AND MOLECULES

conservation of mass and the law of
definite proportions.

According to Dalton s atomic theory, all
matter, whether an element, a compound or
a mixture is composed of small particles called
atoms. The postulates of this theory may be
stated as follows:

(i) All matter is made of very tiny particles
called atoms, which participate in
chemical reactions.

(ii) Atoms are indivisible particles, which
cannot be created or destroyed in a
chemical reaction.

(iii) Atoms ofa given element are identical
in mass and chemical properties.

(iv) Atoms of different elements have
different masses and chemical
properties.

(v) Atoms combine in the ratio of small
whole numbers to form compounds.

(vi) The relative number and kinds of
atoms are constant in a given
compound.

You will study in the next chapter that all
atoms are made up of still smaller particles.

3.2 What is an Atom?

Have you ever observed a mason building
walls, from these walls a room and then a
collection of rooms to form a building? What
is the building block of the huge building?
What about the building block of an ant-hill?
It is a small grain of sand. Similarly, the
building blocks of all matter are atoms.

How big are atoms?

Atoms are very small, they are smaller than
anything that we can imagine or compare
with. More than millions of atoms when
stacked would make a layer barely as thick
as this sheet of paper.

We might think that if atoms are so
insignificant in size, why should we care about
them? This is because our entire world is made
up of atoms. We may not be able to see them,
but they are there, and constantly affecting
whatever we do. Through modern techniques,
we can now produce magnified images of
surfaces of elements showing atoms.

3.2.1 WHAT ARE THE MODERN DAY
SYMBOLS OF ATOMS OF DIFFERENT
ELEMENTS?

Dalton was the first scientist to use the
symbols for elements in a very specific sense.
When he used a symbol for an element he
also meant a definite quantity of that element,
that is, one atom of that element. Berzilius
suggested that the symbols of elements be
made from one or two letters of the name of
the element.

 SCIENCE

Reprint 2025-26

In the beginning, the names of elements
were derived from the name of the place
where they were found for the first time. For
example, the name copper was taken from
Cyprus. Some names were taken from
specific colours. For example, gold was taken
from the English word meaning yellow.
Now-a-days, IUPAC (International Union of
Pure and Applied Chemistry) is an
international scientific organisation which
approves names of elements, symbols and
units. Many of the symbols are the first one
or two letters of the element s name in
English. The first letter of a symbol is always
written as a capital letter (uppercase) and the
second letter as a small letter (lowercase).

For example

(i) hydrogen, H
(ii) aluminium, Al and not AL
(iii) cobalt, Co and not CO.

Symbols of some elements are formed from
the first letter of the name and a letter,
appearing later in the name. Examples are: (i)
chlorine, Cl, (ii) zinc, Zn etc.

Other symbols have been taken from the
names of elements in Latin, German or Greek.
For example, the symbol of iron is Fe from its
Latin name ferrum, sodium is Na from natrium,
potassium is K from kalium. Therefore, each
element has a name and a unique
chemical symbol.

3.2.2 ATOMIC MASS

The most remarkable concept that Dalton s
atomic theory proposed was that of the atomic
mass. According to him, each element had a
characteristic atomic mass. The theory could
explain the law of constant proportions so well
that scientists were prompted to measure the
atomic mass of an atom. Since determining the
mass of an individual atom was a relatively
difficult task, relative atomic masses were
determined using the laws of chemical
combinations and the compounds formed.
Let us take the example of a compound,
carbon monoxide (CO) formed by carbon and
oxygen. It was observed experimentally that 3
g of carbon combines with 4 g of oxygen to
form CO. In other words, carbon combines
with 4/3 times its mass of oxygen. Suppose
we define the atomic mass unit (earlier
abbreviated as amu , but according to the
latest IUPAC recommendations, it is now
written as u unified mass) as equal to the
mass of one carbon atom, then we would

oxygen an atomic mass of 1.33 u. However, it
is more convenient to have these numbers as
Reprint 2025-26

whole numbers or as near to a whole numbers

as possible. While searching for various

atomic mass units, scientists initially took 1/

16 of the mass of an atom of naturally

occurring oxygen as the unit. This was

considered relevant due to two reasons:

e oxygen reacted with a large number of
elements and formed compounds.

e this atomic mass unit gave masses of
most of the elements as whole numbers.

However, in 1961 for a universally
accepted atomic mass unit, carbon-12 isotope
was chosen as the standard reference for
measuring atomic masses. One atomic mass
unit is a mass unit equal to exactly one-twelfth
(1/12) the mass of one atom of carbon-12.
The relative atomic masses of all elements
have been found with respect to an atom of
carbon-12.

Imagine a fruit seller selling fruits without
any standard weight with him. He takes a
watermelon and says, this has a mass equal
to 12 units (12 watermelon units or 12 fruit
mass units). He makes twelve equal pieces of
the watermelon and finds the mass of each fruit
he is selling, relative to the mass of one piece
of the watermelon. Now he sells his fruits by
relative fruit mass unit (fmu), as in Fig. 3.4.

Similarly, the relative atomic mass of the
atom of an element is defined as the average
mass of the atom, as compared to 1/12" the
mass of one carbon-12 atom.

3.2.3 How DO ATOMS EXIST?

Atoms of most elements are not able to exist
independently. Atoms form molecules and
ions. These molecules or ions aggregate in
large numbers to form the matter that we can
see, feel or touch.

2. Why is it not possible to see an
atom with naked eyes?

3.3 What is a Molecule?

A molecule is in general a group of two or
more atoms that are chemically bonded
together, that is, tightly held together by
attractive forces. A molecule can be defined
as the smallest particle of an element or a
compound that is capable of an independent
existence and shows all the properties of that
substance. Atoms of the same element or of
different elements can join together to form
molecules.

3.3.1 MOLECULES OF ELEMENTS

The molecules of an element are constituted
by the same type of atoms. Molecules of many
elements, such as argon (Ar), helium (He) etc.
are made up of only one atom of that element.
But this is not the case with most of the nonmetals. For example, a molecule of oxygen
consists of two atoms of oxygen and hence it
is known as a diatomic molecule, O,. If 3
atoms of oxygen unite into a molecule, instead
of the usual 2, we get ozone, O,. The number
of atoms constituting a molecule is known as
its atomicity.

Metals and some other elements, such as
carbon, do not have a simple structure but
consist of a very large and indefinite number
of atoms bonded together.

Let us look at the atomicity of some
non-metals.

water is H:O = 2:1.

3.3.3, WHAT IS AN ION?

Compounds composed of metals and nonmetals contain charged species. The charged
species are known as ions. Ions may consist
of a single charged atom or a group of atoms
that have a net charge on them. An ion can be
negatively or positively charged. A negatively
charged ion is called an anion and the
positively charged ion, a cation . Take, for
example, sodium chloride (NaCl). Its
constituent particles are positively charged
sodium ions (Na*) and negatively charged
Reprint 2025-26

chloride ions (CI). A group of atoms carrying
a charge is known as a polyatomic ion (Table
3.6). We shall learn more about the formation
of ions in Chapter 4.

3.4 Writing Chemical Formulae

The chemical formula of a compound is a
symbolic representation of its composition. The
chemical formulae of different compounds can
be written easily. For this exercise, we need to

learn the symbols and combining capacity of
the elements.

The combining power (or capacity) of an
element is known as its valency. Valency can
be used to find out how the atoms of an
element will combine with the atom(s) of
another element to form a chemical compound.
The valency of the atom of an element can be
thought of as hands or arms of that atom.

Human beings have two arms and an
octopus has eight. If one octopus has to catch
hold of a few people in such a manner that all
the eight arms of the octopus and both arms
of all the humans are locked, how many
humans do you think the octopus can hold?
Represent the octopus with O and humans
with H. Can you write a formula for this
combination? Do you get OH, as the formula?
The subscript 4 indicates the number of
humans held by the octopus.

The valencies of some common ions are
given in Table 3.6. We will learn more about
valency in the next chapter.

 SCIENCE

Reprint 2025-26

The rules that you have to follow while writing

a chemical formula are as follows:

e the valencies or charges on the ion
must balance.

e whenacompound consists of a metal and
a non-metal, the name or symbol of the
metal is written first. For example: calcium
oxide (CaO), sodium chloride (NaCl), iron
sulphide (FeS), copper oxide (CuO), etc.,
where oxygen, chlorine, sulphur are nonmetals and are written on the right,
whereas calcium, sodium, iron and
copper are metals, and are written on
the left.

e incompounds formed with polyatomic ions,
the number of ions present in the
compound is indicated by enclosing the
formula of ion in a bracket and writing the
number of ions outside the bracket. For
example, Mg (OH),. In case the number of
polyatomic ion is one, the bracket is not
required. For example, NaOH.

3.4.1 FORMULAE OF SIMPLE COMPOUNDS

The simplest compounds, which are made up
of two different elements are called binary
compounds. Valencies of some ions are given
in Table 3.6. You can use these to write
formulae for compounds.

While writing the chemical formulae for
compounds, we write the constituent elements
and their valencies as shown below. Then we
must crossover the valencies of the
combining atoms.

1. Formula of hydrogen chloride
Symbol H Cl

Valency 1 1

Formula of the compound would be HCI.

4. Formula of magnesium chloride

Symbol Mg Cl

Charge 2+ 1Formula : MgCl,

Thus, in magnesium chloride, there are
two chloride ions (CI) for each magnesium
ion (Mg?*). The positive and negative charges
must balance each other and the overall
structure must be neutral. Note that in the
formula, the charges on the ions are
not indicated.

same ions in the formula. Here, the bracket

there are two hydroxyl (OH) groups joined to
one calcium atom. In other words, there are

two atoms each of oxygen and hydrogen in
calcium hydroxide.

3.5 Molecular Mass

In section 3.2.2 we discussed the concept of
atomic mass. This concept can be extended to
calculate molecular masses. The molecular
mass of a substance is the sum of the atomic
masses of all the atoms in a molecule of the
substance. It is therefore the relative mass of
a molecule expressed in atomic mass units (u).

Example 3.1 (a) Calculate the relative
molecular mass of water (H,O).
(b) Calculate the molecular mass of

HNO,.
Solution:
(a) Atomic mass of hydrogen = lu,
oxygen = 16u

So the molecular mass of water, which
contains two atoms of hydrogen and one
atom of oxygen is = 2x 1+1x16
= 18u

(b) The molecular mass of HNO, = the
atomic mass of H + the atomic mass of
N+ 3 x the atomic mass of O

of the atomic masses of all atoms in a formula
