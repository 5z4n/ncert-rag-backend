We have learnt about the motion of objects and
force as the cause of motion. We have learnt
that a force is needed to change the speed or
the direction of motion of an object. We always
observe that an object dropped from a height
falls towards the earth. We know that all the
planets go around the Sun. The moon goes
around the earth. In all these cases, there must
be some force acting on the objects, the planets
and on the moon. Isaac Newton could grasp
that the same force is responsible for all these.
This force is called the gravitational force.

In this chapter we shall learn about
gravitation and the universal law of
gravitation. We shall discuss the motion of
objects under the influence of gravitational
force on the earth. We shall study how the
weight of a body varies from place to place.
We shall also discuss the conditions for
objects to float in liquids.

9.1 Gravitation

We know that the moon goes around the earth.
An object when thrown upwards, reaches a
certain height and then falls downwards. It is
said that when Newton was sitting under a tree,
an apple fell on him. The fall of the apple made
Newton start thinking. He thought that: if the
earth can attract an apple, can it not attract
the moon? Is the force the same in both cases?
He conjectured that the same type of force is
responsible in both the cases. He argued that
at each point of its orbit, the moon falls
towards the earth, instead of going off in a
straight line. So, it must be attracted by the
earth. But we do not really see the moon falling
towards the earth.

GRAVITATION

Let us try to understand the motion of the
moon by recalling activity 7.11.

Activity

e Take a piece of thread.

 Tie a small stone at one end. Hold the
other end of the thread and whirl it
round, as shown in Fig. 9.1.

 Note the motion of the stone.

 Release the thread.

e Again, note the direction of motion of
the stone.

Fig. 9.1: Astone describing a circular path with a

velocity of constant magnitude.

Before the thread is released, the stone
moves in a circular path with a certain speed
and changes direction at every point.
The change in direction involves change in
velocity or acceleration. The force that causes
this acceleration and keeps the body moving
along the circular path is acting towards
the centre. This force is called the
centripetal (meaning centre-seeking ) force.

Reprint 2025-26

In the absence of this force, the stone flies off
along a straight line. This straight line will be
a tangent to the circular path.

Astraight line that meets the circle at
one and only one point is called a
tangent to the circle. Straight line
ABC is a tangent to the circle at
point B.

The motion of the moon around the earth
is due to the centripetal force. The centripetal
force is provided by the force of attraction of
the earth. If there were no such force, the
moon would pursue a uniform straight line
motion.

It is seen that a falling apple is attracted
towards the earth. Does the apple attract the
earth? If so, we do not see the earth moving
towards an apple. Why?

According to the third law of motion, the
apple does attract the earth. But according
to the second law of motion, for a given force,
acceleration is inversely proportional to the
mass of an object [Eq. (8.4)]. The mass of an
apple is negligibly small compared to that of
the earth. So, we do not see the earth moving
towards the apple. Extend the same argument
for why the earth does not move towards the
moon.

In our solar system, all the planets go
around the Sun. By arguing the same way,
we can say that there exists a force between
the Sun and the planets. From the above facts
Newton concluded that not only does the
earth attract an apple and the moon, but all
objects in the universe attract each other. This
force of attraction between objects is called
the gravitational force.

GRAVITATION

9.1.1 UNIVERSAL LAW OF GRAVITATION

Every object in the universe attracts every
other object with a force which is proportional
to the product of their masses and inversely
proportional to the square of the distance
between them. The force is along the line
joining the centres of two objects.

F=G

Fig. 9.2: The gravitational force between two
uniform objects is directed along the line
joining their centres.

Let two objects A and B of masses Mand
mlie at a distance dfrom each other as shown
in Fig. 9.2. Let the force of attraction between
two objects be F: According to the universal
law of gravitation, the force between two
objects is directly proportional to the product
of their masses. That is,

F Mxm (9.1)
And the force between two objects is inversely
proportional to the square of the distance
between them, that is,

Combining Eqs. (10.1) and (10.2), we get

is called the universal gravitation constant.

By multiplying crosswise, Eq. (9.4) gives

The SI unit of G can be obtained by
substituting the units of force, distance and
mass in Eq. (9.5) as N m? kg .

The value of G was found out by
Henry Cavendish (1731 1810) by using a
sensitive balance. The accepted value of G is
6.673 x 107"! N m ? kg .

We know that there exists a force of
attraction between any two objects. Compute
the value of this force between you and your
friend sitting closeby. Conclude how you do
not experience this force!

The law is universal in the sense that
it is applicable to all bodies, whether
the bodies are big or small, whether
they are celestial or terrestrial.

proportional to the square of d
means, for example, that if d gets

Example 9.1 The mass of the earth is

earth and the moon is 3.84x10 km,
calculate the force exerted by the earth on
the moon. (Take G = 6.7 x 10 !! N m? kg?)

Solution:

9.1.2 IMPORTANCE OF THE UNIVERSAL
LAW OF GRAVITATION

The universal law of gravitation successfully
explained several phenomena which were
believed to be unconnected:
(i) the force that binds us to the earth;
(ii) the motion of the moon around the
earth;
(iii) the motion of planets around the Sun;
and
(iv) the tides due to the moon and the Sun.

9.2 Free Fall

Let us try to understand the meaning of free
fall by performing this activity.

Activity 9.2

e Take a stone.

e Throw it upwards.

e It reaches a certain height and then it
starts falling down.

We have learnt that the earth attracts
objects towards it. This is due to the
gravitational force. Whenever objects fall
towards the earth under this force alone, we
say that the objects are in free fall. Is there any

SCIENCE

Reprint 2025-26

change in the velocity of falling objects? While
falling, there is no change in the direction of
motion of the objects. But due to the earth s
attraction, there will be a change in the
magnitude of the velocity. Any change in
velocity involves acceleration. Whenever an
object falls towards the earth, an acceleration
is involved. This acceleration is due to the
earth s gravitational force. Therefore, this
acceleration is called the acceleration due to
the gravitational force of the earth (or
acceleration due to gravity). It is denoted by
g. The unit of gis the same as that of
acceleration, that is, m s .

We know from the second law of motion
that force is the product of mass and
acceleration. Let the mass of the stone in
activity 9.2 be m. We already know that there
is acceleration involved in falling objects due
to the gravitational force and is denoted by g.
Therefore the magnitude of the gravitational
force F will be equal to the product of mass
and acceleration due to the gravitational
force, that is,

F=mg (9.6)
From Eqs. (9.4) and (9.6) we have

objects on or near the surface of the earth,

The earth is not a perfect sphere. As the
radius of the earth increases from the poles to
the equator, the value of gbecomes greater at
the poles than at the equator. For most

calculations, we can take gto be more or less
constant on or near the earth. But for objects
far from the earth, the acceleration due to
gravitational force of earth is given by
Eq. (9.7).

9.2.2 MOTION OF OBJECTS UNDER THE
INFLUENCE OF GRAVITATIONAL
FORCE OF THE EARTH

Let us do an activity to understand whether
all objects hollow or solid, big or small, will
fall from a height at the same rate.

9.3

e Take a sheet of paper and a stone.
Drop them simultaneously from the
first floor of a building. Observe
whether both of them reach the
ground simultaneously.

e We see that paper reaches the ground
little later than the stone. This happens
because of air resistance. The air offers
resistance due to friction to the motion
of the falling objects. The resistance
offered by air to the paper is more than
the resistance offered to the stone. If
we do the experiment in a glass jar
from which air has been sucked out,
the paper and the stone would fall at
the same rate.

Activity
Reprint 2025-26

We know that an object experiences
acceleration during free fall. From Eq. (9.9),
this acceleration experienced by an object is
independent of its mass. This means that all
objects hollow or solid, big or small, should
fall at the same rate. According to a story,
Galileo dropped different objects from the top
of the Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy to prove
the same.

As g is constant near the earth, all the
equations for the uniformly accelerated
motion of objects become valid with
acceleration a replaced by g.
The equations are:

v=utat (9.10)
s=ut+ 5 at (9.11)

uv? =u? + 2as (9.12)

where wand vare the initial and final velocities
and sis the distance coveredin time, t.

In applying these equations, we will take
acceleration, a to be positive when it is in the
direction of the velocity, that is, in the
direction of motion. The acceleration, a will
be taken as negative when it opposes the
motion.

Example 9.2 A car falls off a ledge and
drops to the ground in 0.5 s. Let
g = 10 m s* (for simplifying the
calculations).
(i) What is its speed on striking the
ground?
(ii) What is its average speed during the
0.5 s?
(iii) How high is the ledge from the
ground?

Solution:

Time, t= 4% second

Initial velocity, u=Oms"

Acceleration due to gravity, g=10ms?
Acceleration of the car, a=+ 10ms2

(iii) distance travelled, s= %a?t?

Thus,
(i) its speed on striking the ground

=5ms'!

(ii) its average speed during the 0.5 s

(iii) height of the ledge from the ground
= 1.25 m.

Example 9.3 An object is thrown vertically
upwards and rises to a height of 10 m.
Calculate (i) the velocity with which the
object was thrown upwards and (ii) the
time taken by the object to reach the
highest point.

Solution:

Distance travelled, s= 10m
Final velocity, v>=Oms"
Acceleration due to gravity, g = 9.8 ms?
Acceleration of the object, a= -9.8 ms?
(upward motion)
(i) v?=w+2as

9.3. Mass

We have learnt in the previous chapter that the
mass of an object is the measure of its inertia .
We have also learnt that greater the mass, the
greater is the inertia. It remains the same
whether the object is on the earth, the moon
or even in outer space. Thus, the mass of an
object is constant and does not change from
place to place.

9.4 Weight

We know that the earth attracts every object
with a certain force and this force depends on
the mass (zm) of the object and the acceleration
due to the gravity (g). The weight of an object
is the force with which it is attracted towards
the earth.

We know that

F=mxa, (9.13)
that is,

F=mxg. (9.14)

The force of attraction of the earth on an
object is known as the weight of the object. It
is denoted by W. Substituting the same in Eq.
(9.14), we have

W=mxg (9.15)

As the weight of an object is the force with
which it is attracted towards the earth, the SI
unit of weight is the same as that of force, that
is, newton (N). The weight is a force acting
vertically downwards; it has both magnitude
and direction.

We have learnt that the value of g is
constant at a given place. Therefore at a given
place, the weight of an object is directly
proportional to the mass, say m, of the object,
thatis, W mm. Itis due to this reason that at
a given place, we can use the weight of an
object as a measure of its mass. The mass of
an object remains the same everywhere, that
is, on the earth and on any planet whereas its
weight depends on its location because g
depends on location.

9.4.1 WEIGHT OF AN OBJECT ON

THE MOON

We have learnt that the weight of an object on
the earth is the force with which the earth

attracts the object. In the same way, the weight
of an object on the moon is the force with
which the moon attracts that object. The mass
of the moon is less than that of the earth. Due
to this the moon exerts lesser force of attraction
on objects.

Let the mass of an object be m. Let its
weight on the moon be W,,. Let the mass of
the moon be M,, and its radius be R,.

9.5 Thrust and Pressure

Have you ever wondered why a camel can run
in a desert easily? Why an army tank weighing
more than a thousand tonne rests upon a
continuous chain? Why a truck or a motorbus
has much wider tyres? Why cutting tools have
sharp edges? In order to address these
questions and understand the phenomena
involved, it helps to introduce the concepts
of the net force in a particular direction (thrust)
and the force per unit area (pressure) acting
on the object concerned.

Let us try to understand the meanings of

thrust and pressure by considering the
following situations:
Situation 1: You wish to fix a poster on a
bulletin board, as shown in Fig 9.3. To do this
task you will have to press drawing pins with
your thumb. You apply a force on the surface
area of the head of the pin. This force is directed
perpendicular to the surface area of the board.
This force acts on a smaller area at the tip of
the pin.

Fig. 9.3: To fix a poster, drawing pins are pressed
with the thumb perpendicular to the board.

Situation 2: You stand on loose sand. Your
feet go deep into the sand. Now, lie down on
the sand. You will find that your body will not
go that deep in the sand. In both cases the
force exerted on the sand is the weight of your
body.

SCIENCE

Reprint 2025-26

You have learnt that weight is the force
acting vertically downwards. Here the force is
acting perpendicular to the surface of the sand.
The force acting on an object perpendicular to
the surface is called thrust.

When you stand on loose sand, the force,
that is, the weight of your body is acting on
an area equal to area of your feet. When you
lie down, the same force acts on an area equal
to the contact area of your whole body, which
is larger than the area of your feet. Thus, the
effects of forces of the same magnitude on
different areas are different. In the above
cases, thrust is the same. But effects are
different. Therefore the effect of thrust
depends on the area on which it acts.

The effect of thrust on sand is larger while
standing than while lying. The thrust on unit
area is called pressure. Thus,

thrust
area

Substituting the SI unit of thrust and area in
Eq. (9.20), we get the SI unit of pressure as N/
m? or Nm .

In honour of scientist Blaise Pascal, the
SI unit of pressure is called pascal, denoted
as Pa.

Let us consider a numerical example to
understand the effects of thrust acting on
different areas.

Pressure = (9.20)

Example 9.6 A block of wood is kept ona
tabletop. The mass of wooden block is 5
kg and its dimensions are 40 cm x 20
cm x 10 cm. Find the pressure exerted

Fig. 9.4

GRAVITATION

by the wooden block on the table top if
it is made to lie on the table top with its
sides of dimensions (a) 20 cm x 10 cm
and (b) 40 cm x 20 cm.

Solution:

The mass of the wooden block = 5 kg
The dimensions
= 40 cm x 20 cm x 10 cm
Here, the weight of the wooden block
applies a thrust on the table top.
That is,
Thrust=F = mxg

= 5kgx9.8ms?

= 49N
Area of a side = length x breadth

= 20cm x 10cm

= 200 cm? = 0.02 m?
From Eq. (9.20),

4ON
Pressure = 0.02 m2

= 2450 N m .

When the block lies on its side of
dimensions 40 cm x 20 cm, it exerts
the same thrust.
Area= length x breadth

= 40cm~x 20cm

= 800 cm? = 0.08 m?
From Eq. (9.20),

49N
= 0.08 m?
= 612.5 N m?
The pressure exerted by the side 20 cm

x 10 cm is 2450 N m ? and by the side
40 cm x 20 cm is 612.5 N m .

Pressure

Thus, the same force acting on a smaller
area exerts a larger pressure, and a smaller
pressure on a larger area. This is the reason
why a nail has a pointed tip, knives have sharp
edges and buildings have wide foundations.

9.5.1 PRESSURE IN FLUIDS

All liquids and gases are fluids. A solid exerts
pressure on a surface due to its weight.
Similarly, fluids have weight, and they also
Reprint 2025-26

exert pressure on the base and walls of the
container in which they are enclosed. Pressure
exerted in any confined mass of fluid is
transmitted undiminished in all directions.

9.5.2 BUOYANCY

Have you ever had a swim in a pool and felt
lighter? Have you ever drawn water from a
well and felt that the bucket of water is heavier
when it is out of the water? Have you ever
wondered why a ship made of iron and steel
does not sink in sea water, but while the same
amount of iron and steel in the form of a sheet
would sink? These questions can be answered
by taking buoyancy in consideration. Let us
understand the meaning of buoyancy by
doing an activity.

Activity

e Take an empty plastic bottle. Close
the mouth of the bottle with an
airtight stopper. Put it in a bucket
filled with water. You see that the
bottle floats.

 Push the bottle into the water. You feel
an upward push. Try to push it further
down. You will find it difficult to push
deeper and deeper. This indicates that
water exerts a force on the bottle in the
upward direction. The upward force
exerted by the water goes on increasing
as the bottle is pushed deeper till it is
completely immersed.

 Now, release the bottle. It bounces
back to the surface.

e Does the force due to the gravitational
attraction of the earth act on this
bottle? If so, why doesn t the bottle stay
immersed in water after it is released?
How can you immerse the bottle in
water?

The force due to the gravitational
attraction of the earth acts on the bottle in
the downward direction. So the bottle is
pulled downwards. But the water exerts an
upward force on the bottle. Thus, the bottle is
pushed upwards. We have learnt that weight
of an object is the force due to gravitational
attraction of the earth. When the bottle is
immersed, the upward force exerted by the
water on the bottle is greater than its weight.
Therefore it rises up when released.

To keep the bottle completely immersed,
the upward force on the bottle due to water
must be balanced. This can be achieved by
an externally applied force acting downwards.
This force must at least be equal to the
difference between the upward force and the
weight of the bottle.

The upward force exerted by the water on
the bottle is known as upthrust or buoyant
force. In fact, all objects experience a force of
buoyancy when they are immersed in a fluid.
The magnitude of this buoyant force depends
on the density of the fluid.

9.5.3 WHY OBJECTS FLOAT OR SINK
WHEN PLACED ON THE SURFACE OF
WATER?

Let us do the following activities to arrive at
an answer for the above question.

Activity

 Take a beaker filled with water.

e Take an iron nail and place it on the
surface of the water.

 Observe what happens.

The nail sinks. The force due to the
gravitational attraction of the earth on the
iron nail pulls it downwards. There is an
upthrust of water on the nail, which pushes
it upwards. But the downward force acting
on the nail is greater than the upthrust of
water on the nail. So it sinks (Fig. 9.5).

Fig. 9.5: An iron nail sinks and a cork floats when
placed on the surface of water.

SCIENCE

Reprint 2025-26

Activity

e Take a beaker filled with water.

e Take a piece of cork and an iron nail of
equal mass.

e Place them on the surface of water.

 Observe what happens.

The cork floats while the nail sinks. This
happens because of the difference in their
densities. The density of a substance is
defined as the mass per unit volume. The
density of cork is less than the density of
water. This means that the upthrust of water
on the cork is greater than the weight of the
cork. So it floats (Fig. 9.5).

The density of an iron nail is more than
the density of water. This means that the
upthrust of water on the iron nail is less than
the weight of the nail. So it sinks.

Therefore objects of density less than that
of a liquid float on the liquid. The objects of
density greater than that of a liquid sink in
the liquid.

end of a rubber string or a spring
balance.

 Suspend the stone by holding the
balance or the string as shown in
Fig. 9.6 (a).

Fig. 9.6: (a) Observe the elongation of the rubber
string due to the weight of a piece of stone
suspended from it in air. (b) The elongation
decreases as the stone is immersed
in water.

 Observe what happens to elongation
of the string or the reading on the
balance.

You will find that the elongation of the string
or the reading of the balance decreases as the
stone is gradually lowered in the water. However,
no further change is observed once the stone
gets fully immersed in the water. What do you
infer from the decrease in the extension of the
string or the reading of the spring balance?

We know that the elongation produced in
the string or the spring balance is due to the
weight of the stone. Since the extension
decreases once the stone is lowered in water,
it means that some force acts on the stone in
upward direction. As a result, the net force on
the string decreases and hence the elongation
also decreases. As discussed earlier, this
upward force exerted by water is known as
the force of buoyancy.

What is the magnitude of the buoyant
force experienced by a body? Is it the same
in all fluids for a given body? Do all bodies
in a given fluid experience the same buoyant
force? The answer to these questions is

The law of gravitation states that the force of attraction
between any two objects is proportional to the product of
their masses and inversely proportional to the square of
the distance between them. The law applies to objects
anywhere in the universe. Such a law is said to be universal.
Gravitation is a weak force unless large masses are involved.

The force of gravity decreases with altitude. It also varies
on the surface of the earth, decreasing from poles to the
equator.

The weight of a body is the force with which the earth
attracts it.

The weight is equal to the product of mass and acceleration
due to gravity.

The weight may vary from place to place but the mass stays
constant.

All objects experience a force of buoyancy when they are
immersed in a fluid.

Objects having density less than that of the liquid in which
they are immersed, float on the surface of the liquid. If the
density of the object is more than the density of the liquid in
which it is immersed then it sinks in the liquid.

GRAVITATION

How does the force of gravitation between two objects change
when the distance between them is reduced to half ?

Gravitational force acts on all objects in proportion to their
masses. Why then, a heavy object does not fall faster than
a light object?

What is the magnitude of the gravitational force between the
earth and a 1 kg object on its surface? (Mass of the earth is
6 x 10%4 kg and radius of the earth is 6.4 x 10 m.)

The earth and the moon are attracted to each other by
gravitational force. Does the earth attract the moon with a
force that is greater or smaller or the same as the force
with which the moon attracts the earth? Why?

If the moon attracts the earth, why does the earth not move
towards the moon?

What happens to the force between two objects, if

(i) the mass of one object is doubled?

(ii) the distance between the objects is doubled and tripled?
(iii) the masses of both objects are doubled?

What is the importance of universal law of gravitation?
What is the acceleration of free fall?

What do we call the gravitational force between the earth and
an object?
