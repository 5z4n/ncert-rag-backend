10.1 Area of a Triangle by Heron s Formula
We know that the area of triangle when its height is given, is 5 x base x height. Now

suppose that we know the lengths of the sides of a scalene triangle and not the height.
Can you still find its area? For instance, you have a triangular park whose sides are 40
m, 32 m, and 24 m. How will you calculate its area? Definitely 1f you want to apply the
formula, you will have to calculate its height. But we do not have a clue to calculate
the height. Try doing so. If you are not able to get it, then go to the next section.

Heron was born in about 10AD possibly in Alexandria in
Egypt. He worked in applied mathematics. His works on
mathematical and physical subjects are so numerous and
varied that he is considered to be an encyclopedic writer
in these fields. His geometrical works deal largely with
problems on mensuration written in three books. Book I
deals with the area of squares, rectangles, triangles,
trapezoids (trapezia), various other specialised
quadrilaterals, the regular polygons, circles, surfaces of
cylinders, cones, spheres etc. In this book, Heron has
derived the famous formula for the area of a triangle in Heron (10 C.E. 75 C.E.)

terms of its three sides. Fig. 10.1

The formula given by Heron about the area of a triangle, is also known as Hero s
formula. It is stated as:

Area of a triangle = ./s(s a) (s b)(s c) (1)

where a, b and c are the sides of the triangle, and s = semi-perimeter, i.e., half the
at+b+c
This formula is helpful where it is not possible to find the height of the triangle
easily. Let us apply it to calculate the area of the triangular park ABC, mentioned
above (see Fig. 10.2).

Let us take a = 40 m, b = 24 m, c = 32 m,

perimeter of the triangle =

A
40 + 244+ 32
so that we have s = 5 m = 48 m. 32m 24m
s a=(48 40) m=8 m,
s b=(48 24)m=24m, B 40an c
s c=(48 32)m= 16m. Fig, 10.2

Therefore, area of the park ABC

s(s a) (s b) (s -c)

= [48 x8 x 24x 16m?= 384m?

We see that 32? + 24? = 1024 + 576 = 1600 = 40 . Therefore, the sides of the park
make a right triangle. The largest side, i.e., BC which is 40 m will be the hypotenuse
and the angle between the sides AB and AC will be 90 .
We can check that the area of the park is 5 x 32 x 24 m = 384 m .

We find that the area we have got is the same as we found by using Heron s
formula.

Now using Heron s formula, you verify this fact by finding the areas of other
triangles discussed earlier viz.,
(i) equilateral triangle with side 10 cm.
(ii) isosceles triangle with unequal side as 8 cm and each equal side as 5 cm.
You will see that
10+10+10

For (i), we have s = 5 cm = 15 cm.

Area of triangle = ,/15(15 10) (15 10) (15 10) cm?

= /15x5x5x5 cm? = 25y3 cm?

. 8+54+5
For (ii), we have s = cm =9cm

Area of triangle = /9(9 8) (9 5) (9-5) em?= 9x 1x 4x 4cm?=12 cm .

Let us now solve some more examples:

Example 1 : Find the area of a triangle, two sides of which are 8 cm and 11 cm and
the perimeter is 32 cm (see Fig. 10.3).

Solution : Here we have perimeter of the triangle = 32 cm, a = 8 cm and 6 = 11 cm.
Third side c = 32 cm (8 + 11) cm= 13 cm C

So, 2s = 32,1.e.,5 = 16cm,

lhcm 8 cm
s a=(16 8)cm=8 cm,
s b= (16-11)cm=S5 cm, A B
s c= (16-13) cm=3 cm. Fig. 10.3

Therefore, area of the triangle = Js(s a)(s b)(s- c)

= [16x 8x 5x3cm?= 8/30 cm?

Example 2 : A triangular park ABC has sides 120m, 80m and 50m (see Fig. 10.4). A
gardener Dhania has to put a fence all around it and also plant grass inside. How
much area does she need to plant? Find the cost of fencing it with barbed wire at the
rate of 20 per metre leaving a space 3m wide for a gate on one side.

Solution : For finding area of the park, we have

= 4 | _ A
2s = 50m+80m-+ 120 m= 250 m. 50m 80m
Le., s= 125m
Now, s a= (125- 120)m=5m, B C
s b= (125- 80)m=45 m, < _ 120 mn
s c= (125 50)m=75 m. Fig. 10.4

Therefore, area of the park = Js(s a)(s b)(s- c)

= f125x5x 45x75 m

= 375J/15 m 
Also, perimeter of the park = AB + BC +CA= 250m
Therefore, length of the wire needed for fencing = 250 m 3 m (to be left for gate)

= 247m
And so the cost of fencing = 20 = 247 = $4940

Example 3 : The sides of a triangular plot are in the ratio of 3 : 5 : 7 and its perimeter
is 300 m. Find its area.

Solution : Suppose that the sides, in metres, are 3x, 5x and 7x (see Fig. 10.5).
Then, we know that 3x + 5x + 7x = 300 (perimeter of the triangle)

Therefore, 15x = 300, which gives x = 20.

So the sides of the triangle are 3 x 20 m, 5 x 20 m and 7 x 20m

1.e., 60m, 100 mand 140 m.
