8.1 Properties of a Parallelogram

You have already studied quadrilaterals and their types in Class VII. A quadrilateral
has four sides, four angles and four vertices. A parallelogram is a quadrilateral in

which both pairs of opposite sides are parallel.

_ D C
Let us perform an activity.

Cut out a parallelogram from a sheet of paper
and cut it along a diagonal (see Fig. 8.1). You obtain
two triangles. What can you say about these
triangles?
Place one triangle over the other. Turn one around,
if necessary. What do you observe? A B

Observe that the two triangles are congruent to Fig. 8.1
each other.
Repeat this activity with some more parallelograms. Each time you will observe
that each diagonal divides the parallelogram into two congruent triangles.
Let us now prove this result.
Theorem 8.1 : A diagonal of a parallelogram divides it into two congruent
triangles.

Proof : Let ABCD be a parallelogram and AC be a diagonal (see Fig. 8.2). Observe
that the diagonal AC divides parallelogram ABCD into two triangles, namely, A ABC
and A CDA. We need to prove that these triangles are congruent.

QUADRILATERALS 105

In A ABC and A CDA, note that BC || AD and AC is a transversal.

So, Z BCA= Z DAC (Pair of alternate angles) D c
Also, AB || DC and AC is a transversal.

So, Z BAC=Z DCA (Pair of alternate angles)

and AC=CA (Common) B

So, A ABC = ACDA (ASA rule) Fig. 8.2

or, diagonal AC divides parallelogram ABCD into two congruent
triangles ABC and CDA.
Now, measure the opposite sides of parallelogram ABCD. What do you observe?

You will find that AB = DC and AD = BC.

This is another property of a parallelogram stated below:

Theorem 8.2 : In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal.

You have already proved that a diagonal divides the parallelogram into two congruent
triangles; so what can you say about the corresponding parts say, the corresponding
sides? They are equal.

So, AB=DC and AD=BC
Now what is the converse of this result? You already know that whatever is given

in a theorem, the same is to be proved in the converse and whatever is proved in the
theorem it is given in the converse. Thus, Theorem 8.2 can be stated as given below :

Ifa quadrilateral is a parallelogram, then each pair of its opposite sides is equal. So
its converse is :
Theorem 8.3 : If each pair of opposite sides of a quadrilateral is equal, then it
is a parallelogram.

Can you reason out why? D C

Let sides AB and CD of the quadrilateral ABCD
be equal and also AD = BC (see Fig. 8.3). Draw

diagonal AC.
Clearly, A ABC = A CDA (Why?)
So, ZBAC= Z DCA A B
and ZBCA= Z DAC (Why?) Fig. 8.3

Can you now say that ABCD is a parallelogram? Why?

106 MATHEMATICS

You have just seen that in a parallelogram each pair of opposite sides is equal and
conversely if each pair of opposite sides of a quadrilateral is equal, then it is a
parallelogram. Can we conclude the same result for the pairs of opposite angles?

Draw a parallelogram and measure its angles. What do you observe?
Each pair of opposite angles is equal.

Repeat this with some more parallelograms. We arrive at yet another result as
given below.

Theorem 8.4 : In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal.

Now, is the converse of this result also true? Yes. Using the angle sum property of
a quadrilateral and the results of parallel lines intersected by a transversal, we can see
that the converse is also true. So, we have the following theorem :

Theorem 8.5 : [fin a quadrilateral, each pair of opposite angles is equal, then
it is a parallelogram.

There is yet another property of a parallelogram. Let us study the same. Draw a
parallelogram ABCD and draw both its diagonals intersecting at the point O
(see Fig. 8.4).

Measure the lengths of OA, OB, OC and OD.

What do you observe? You will observe that
OA=OC and OB=OD.

or, Odis the mid-point of both the diagonals.

Repeat this activity with some more parallelograms. A B

Each time you will find that O is the mid-point of Fig. 8.4
both the diagonals.

So, we have the following theorem :
Theorem 8.6 : The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.

Now, what would happen, if in a quadrilateral the diagonals bisect each other?
Will it be aparallelogram? Indeed this is true.

This result is the converse of the result of Theorem 8.6. It is given below:

Theorem 8.7 : Jf the diagonals of a quadrilateral bisect each other, then it is a
parallelogram.

You can reason out this result as follows:

Reprint 2025-26

QUADRILATERALS 107

Note that in Fig. 8.5, it is given that OA = OC D C

and OB = OD.

So, A AOB2=ACOD_ (Why?) o
Therefore, Z ABO = ZCDO_ (Why?)

From this, we get AB || CD Lo

Similarly, BC || AD A B
Therefore ABCD is a parallelogram. Fig. 8.5

Let us now take some examples.

Example 1 : Show that each angle of a rectangle is a right angle.

Solution : Let us recall what a rectangle is.

A rectangle is a parallelogram in which one angle is a right angle.

Let ABCD be a rectangle in which 7 A = 90 . D C
We have to show that Z B= 7 C= Z D=90 

We have, AD || BC and AB is a transversal
(see Fig. 8.6).

So, 2ZA+ZB= 180 (interior angles on the same

side of the transversal) Fig. 8.6
But, Z A= 90 
So, Z B= 180 Z A= 180 90 = 90 
Now, ZC=ZAandZD=2B
(Opposite angles of the parallellogram)
So, ZC=90 and Z D=90 .

Therefore, each of the angles of a rectangle is a right angle.

Example 2 : Show that the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular to each other.
Solution : Consider the rhombus ABCD (see Fig. 8.7). D C
You know that AB = BC = CD = DA (Why?)
Now, in A AOD and A COD,

OA = OC (Diagonals of a parallelogram
bisect each other)

OD = OD (Common) A B
AD = CD Fig. 8.7

Reprint 2025-26

108 MATHEMATICS

Therefore, A AOD =~ A COD
(SSS congruence rule)

This gives, Z AOD = Z COD (CPCT)
But, Z AOD + Z COD = 180 (Linear pair)
So, 2Z AOD = 180 
or, Z AOD = 90 
So, the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular to each other.
Example 3 : ABC is an isosceles triangle in which AB = AC. AD bisects exterior
angle PAC and CD || AB (see Fig. 8.8). Show that
(7) Z DAC = 2 BCA and_ (ii) ABCD is a parallelogram.
Solution : (i) A ABC is isosceles in which AB = AC (Given)
So, ZABC= Z ACB (Angles opposite to equal sides)

Also, Z PAC = Z ABC+ Z ACB
(Exterior angle of a triangle)

or, Z PAC = 24 ACB (1) 
Now, AD bisects Z PAC.
So, Z PAC = 24 DAC (2)
Therefore,
2Z DAC = 22 ACB [From (1) and (2)] 5 Cc
o, ZDAC= ZACB Fig. 8.8

(11) Now, these equal angles form a pair of alternate angles when line segments BC
and AD are intersected by a transversal AC.

So, BC || AD

Also, BA || CD (Given)

Now, both pairs of opposite sides of quadrilateral ABCD are parallel.
So, ABCD is a parallelogram.

Example 4 : Two parallel lines / and m are intersected by a transversal p
(see Fig. 8.9). Show that the quadrilateral formed by the bisectors of interior angles is
a rectangle.

QUADRILATERALS 109

Solution : It is given that PS || QR and transversal p intersects them at points A and
C respectively.

The bisectors of Z PAC and 7 ACQ intersect at B and bisectors of Z ACR and
Z SAC intersect at D.

We are to show that quadrilateral ABCD is a
rectangle.

Now, Z PAC = Z ACR

(Alternate angles as / || m and p is a transversal)

1 1
So, 74 PAC = > Z ACR

i.e., Z BAC = Z ACD

These form a pair of alternate angles for lines AB

and DC with AC as transversal and they are equal also. Fig. 8-9
So, AB || DC
Similarly, BC || AD (Considering Z ACB and Z CAD)
Therefore, quadrilateral ABCD is a parallelogram.
Also, Z PAC + Z CAS = 180 (Linear pair)
So ty PACH ZCAS = ~ = 180 =90 
 2 2 2
Or, Z BAC + Z CAD = 90 
or, Z BAD = 90 

So, ABCD is a parallelogram in which one angle is 90 .
Therefore, ABCD is a rectangle.

Example 5 : Show that the bisectors of angles of a meen form a rectangle.

Solution : Let P, Q, R and S be the points of
intersection of the bisectors of Z Aand ZB, ZB
and ZC, ZC and Z D, and 7 Dand Z A respectively
of parallelogram ABCD (see Fig. 8.10).

In A ASD, what do you observe? AM

Since DS bisects Z D and AS bisects Z A, therefore,

 5 x 180 (ZAand Z D are interior angles
on the same side of the transversal)
= 90 
Also, Z DAS + Z ADS + Z DSA= 180 (Angle sum property of a triangle)
or, 90 + Z DSA = 180 
Or, Z DSA = 90 
So, Z PSR = 90 (Being vertically opposite to Z DSA)

Similarly, it can be shown that Z APB = 90 or Z SPQ = 90 (as it was shown for
Z DSA). Similarly, Z PQR = 90 and Z SRQ = 90 .
So, PQRS is a quadrilateral in which all angles are right angles.

Can we conclude that it is a rectangle? Let us examine. We have shown that
Z PSR = Z PQR = 90 and Z SPQ = Z SRQ = 90 . So both pairs of opposite angles
are equal.

Therefore, PQRS is a parallelogram in which one angle (in fact all angles) is 90 and
so, PQRS is a rectangle.

8.2 The Mid-point Theorem

You have studied many properties of a triangle as well as a quadrilateral. Now let us
study yet another result which is related to the mid-point of sides ofa triangle. Perform
the following activity.

Draw a triangle and mark the mid-points E and F of two sides of the triangle. Join
the points E and F (see Fig. 8.15).

Measure EF and BC. Measure Z AEF and Z ABC. A
What do you observe? You will find that :
EF = > BC and 4 AEF = 2 ABC E F
so, EF|| BC
Repeat this activity with some more triangles. B C

So, you arrive at the following theorem: Fig. 8.15

Reprint 2025-26

112 MATHEMATICS

Theorem 8.8 : The line segment joining the mid-points of two sides of a triangle
is parallel to the third side.

You can prove this theorem using the following
clue:

Observe Fig 8.16 in which E and F are mid-points
of AB and AC respectively and CD || BA.

A AEF = ACDF_ (ASA Rule)
So, EF=DF and BE=AE=DC_ (Why?)
Therefore, BCDE is a parallelogram. (Why?)
This gives EF || BC.

1 1
In this case, also note that EF = 5 ED= > BC.

Can you state the converse of Theorem 8.8? Is the converse true?
You will see that converse of the above theorem is also true which is stated as
below:

Theorem 8.9 : The line drawn through the mid-point of one side of a triangle,
parallel to another side bisects the third side.

In Fig 8.17, observe that E is the mid-point of
AB, line / is passsing through E and is parallel to BC
and CM || BA.

Prove that AF = CF by using the congruence of
A AEF and A CDF.

Example 6 : In A ABC, D, E and F are respectively
the mid-points of sides AB, BC and CA
(see Fig. 8.18). Show that A ABC is divided into four
congruent triangles by joining D, E and F.

Solution : As D and E are mid-points of sides AB
and BC of the triangle ABC, by Theorem 8.8, B C

DE || AC
Similarly, DF || BC and EF || AB

Therefore ADEF, BDFE and DFCE are all parallelograms.
Now DE is a diagonal of the parallelogram BDFE,
therefore, A BDE = A FED

Similarly A DAF = A FED

and A EFC = A FED

So, all the four triangles are congruent.

Example 7: J, m and 7 are three parallel lines
intersected by transversals p and q such that /, m
and n cut off equal intercepts AB and BC on p
(see Fig. 8.19). Show that /, m and n cut off equal
intercepts DE and EF on q also.

Solution : We are given that AB = BC and have
to prove that DE = EF.

Let us join A to F intersecting m at G..

The trapezium ACED is divided into two triangles; Fig. 8.19
namely A ACF and A AFD.

In A ACF, it is given that B is the mid-point of AC (AB = BC)
and BG|| CF (since m || 7).
So, Gis the mid-point of AF (by using Theorem 8.9)

Now, in A AFD, we can apply the same argument as G is the mid-point of AF,
GE || AD and so by Theorem 8.9, E is the mid-point of DF,

L.e., DE = EF.

In other words, /, m and n cut off equal intercepts on g also.
