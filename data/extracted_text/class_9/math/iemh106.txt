6.1 Introduction

In Chapter 5, you have studied that a minimum of two points are required to draw a
line. You have also studied some axioms and, with the help of these axioms, you
proved some other statements. In this chapter, you will study the properties of the
angles formed when two lines intersect each other, and also the properties of the
angles formed when a line intersects two or more parallel lines at distinct points.
Further you will use these properties to prove some statements using deductive reasoning
(see Appendix 1). You have already verified these statements through some activities
in the earlier classes.

In your daily life, you see different types of angles formed between the edges of
plane surfaces. For making a similar kind of model using the plane surfaces, you need
to have a thorough knowledge of angles. For instance, suppose you want to make a
model of a hut to keep in the school exhibition using bamboo sticks. Imagine how you
would make it? You would keep some of the sticks parallel to each other, and some
sticks would be kept slanted. Whenever an architect has to draw a plan for a multistoried
building, she has to draw intersecting lines and parallel lines at different angles. Without
the knowledge of the properties of these lines and angles, do you think she can draw
the layout of the building?

In science, you study the properties of light by drawing the ray diagrams.
For example, to study the refraction property of light when it enters from one medium
to the other medium, you use the properties of intersecting lines and parallel lines.
When two or more forces act on a body, you draw the diagram in which forces are
represented by directed line segments to study the net effect of the forces on the
body. At that time, you need to know the relation between the angles when the rays
(or line segments) are parallel to or intersect each other. To find the height of a tower
or to find the distance of a ship from the light house, one needs to know the angle

formed between the horizontal and the line of sight. Plenty of other examples can be
given where lines and angles are used. In the subsequent chapters of geometry, you
will be using these properties of lines and angles to deduce more and more useful
properties.

Let us first revise the terms and definitions related to lines and angles learnt in
earlier classes.

6.2 Basic Terms and Definitions

Recall that a part (or portion) of a line with two end points is called a line-segment
and a part ofa line with one end point is called a ray. Note that the line segment AB is
denoted by AB, and its length is denoted by AB. The ray AB is denoted by AB, and

a line is denoted by AB. However, we will not use these symbols, and will denote

the line segment AB, ray AB, length AB and line AB by the same symbol, AB. The
meaning will be clear from the context. Sometimes small letters /, m, n, etc. will be
used to denote lines.

If three or more points lie on the same line, they are called collinear points;
otherwise they are called non-collinear points.

Recall that an angle is formed when two rays originate from the same end point.
The rays making an angle are called the arms of the angle and the end point is called
the vertex of the angle. You have studied different types of angles, such as acute
angle, right angle, obtuse angle, straight angle and reflex angle in earlier classes

(see Fig. 6.1).

(i) acute angle : 0 <x <90 (i1) right angle : y= 90 (ii1) obtuse angle : 90 <z < 180 

(iv) straight angle : s = 180 (v) reflex angle : 180 <t< 360 
Fig. 6.1 : Types of Angles

Reprint 2025-26

LINES AND ANGLES 71

An acute angle measures between 0 and 90 , whereas a right angle is exactly
equal to 90 . An angle greater than 90 but less than 180 is called an obtuse angle.
Also, recall that a straight angle is equal to 180 . An angle which is greater than 180 
but less than 360 is called a reflex angle. Further, two angles whose sum is 90 are
called complementary angles, and two angles whose sum is 180 are called
supplementary angles.

You have also studied about adjacent angles
in the earlier classes (see Fig. 6.2). Two angles
are adjacent, if they have a common vertex, a
common arm and their non-common arms are D
on different sides of the common arm. In
Fig. 6.2, Z ABD and Z DBC are adjacent
angles. Ray BD is their common arm and point
B is their common vertex. Ray BA and ray BC
are non common arms. Moreover, when two B
angles are adjacent, then their sum is always
equal to the angle formed by the two noncommon arms. So, we can write

Z ABC = Z ABD + Z DBC.

Note that Z ABC and Z ABD are not D
adjacent angles. Why? Because their noncommon arms BD and BC lie on the same side
of the common arm BA.

C

If the non-common arms BA and BC in
Fig. 6.2, form a line then it will look like Fig. 6.3.

In this case, Z ABD and Z DBC are called ; ; ;
linear pair of angles. Fig. 6.3 : Linear pair of angles

You may also recall the vertically opposite
angles formed when two lines, say AB and CD,
intersect each other, say at the point O
(see Fig. 6.4). There are two pairs of vertically
opposite angles.

One pair is ZAOD and ZBOC. Can you
find the other pair?

6.3 Intersecting Lines and Non-intersecting Lines

Draw two different lines PQ and RS on a paper. You will see that you can draw them
in two different ways as shown in Fig. 6.5 (i) and Fig. 6.5 (11).

Recall the notion ofa line, that it extends indefinitely in both directions. Lines PQ
and RS in Fig. 6.5 (1) are intersecting lines and in Fig. 6.5 (11) are parallel lines. Note
that the lengths of the common perpendiculars at different points on these parallel
lines is the same. This equal length is called the distance between two parallel lines.

6.4 Pairs of Angles

In Section 6.2, you have learnt the definitions of

some of the pairs of angles such as C
complementary angles, supplementary angles,

adjacent angles, linear pair of angles, etc. Can

you think of some relations between these

angles? Now, let us find out the relation between

the angles formed when a ray stands on a line.

Draw a figure in which a ray stands ona line as ~", O B
shown in Fig. 6.6. Name the line as AB and the

ray as OC. What are the angles formed at the _ Fig. 6.6: Linear pair of angles
point O? They are Z AOC, Z BOC and Z AOB.

Can we write Z AOC + Z BOC = 4 AOB? (1)
Yes! (Why? Refer to adjacent angles in Section 6.2)
What is the measure of Z AOB? It is 180 . (Why?) (2)

From (1) and (2), can you say that Z AOC + Z BOC = 180 ? Yes! (Why?)

From the above discussion, we can state the following Axiom:

Reprint 2025-26

LINES AND ANGLES 73

Axiom 6.1 : If a ray stands on a line, then the sum of two adjacent angles so
formed is 180 .

Recall that when the sum of two adjacent angles is 180 , then they are called a
linear pair of angles.

In Axiom 6.1, it is given that a ray stands on a line . From this given , we have
concluded that the sum of two adjacent angles so formed is 180 . Can we write
Axiom 6.1 the other way? That is, take the conclusion of Axiom 6.1 as given and
the given as the conclusion . So it becomes:

(A) If the sum of two adjacent angles is 180 , then a ray stands on a line (that is,
the non-common arms form a line).

Now you see that the Axiom 6.1 and statement (A) are in a sense the reverse of
each others. We call each as converse of the other. We do not know whether the
statement (A) is true or not. Let us check. Draw adjacent angles of different measures
as shown in Fig. 6.7. Keep the ruler along one of the non-common arms in each case.
Does the other non-common arm also lie along the ruler?

(iii)

Fig. 6.7 : Adjacent angles with different measures

Reprint 2025-26

74 MATHEMATICS

You will find that only in Fig. 6.7 (111), both the non-common arms lie along the
ruler, that is, points A, O and B lie on the same line and ray OC stands on it. Also see
that Z AOC + Z COB = 125 + 55 = 180 . From this, you may conclude that statement
(A) is true. So, you can state in the form of an axiom as follows:

Axiom 6.2 : If the sum of two adjacent angles is 180 , then the non-common arms
of the angles form a line.

For obvious reasons, the two axioms above together is called the Linear Pair
Axiom.

Let us now examine the case when two lines intersect each other.

Recall, from earlier classes, that when two lines intersect, the vertically opposite
angles are equal. Let us prove this result now. See Appendix | for the ingredients of a
proof, and keep those in mind while studying the proof given below.

Theorem 6.1 : If two lines intersect each other, then the vertically opposite
angles are equal.

Proof : In the statement above, it is given
that two lines intersect each other . So, let
AB and CD be two lines intersecting at O as
shown in Fig. 6.8. They lead to two pairs of
vertically opposite angles, namely,

(i) Z AOC and Z BOD (ii) Z AOD and
Z BOC. Fig. 6.8 : Vertically opposite angles

We need to prove that Z AOC = Z BOD
and Z AOD = Z BOC.

Now, ray OA stands on line CD.
Therefore, Z AOC + Z AOD = 180 (Linear pair axiom) (1)
Can we write Z AOD + Z BOD = 180 ? Yes! (Why?) (2)
From (1) and (2), we can write

Z AOC + Z AOD = Z AOD + Z BOD
This implies that 7 AOC = Z BOD (Refer Section 5.2, Axiom 3)
Similarly, it can be proved that ZAOD = ZBOC

Now, let us do some examples based on Linear Pair Axiom and Theorem 6.1.

Example 1 : In Fig. 6.9, lines PQ and RS
intersect each other at point O. If P
Z POR: Z ROQ=5: 7, find all the angles.

Solution: Z POR +Z ROQ = 180 
(Linear pair of angles)

But Z POR: ZROQ=5:7 R
(Given)
Therefore, Z POR = D x 180 = 75

Similarly, Z ROQ= D x 180 = 105 
Now, Z POS = ZROQ = 105 
and Z SOQ = ZPOR = 75

(Vertically opposite angles)

Example 2 : In Fig. 6.10, ray OS stands on a line POQ. Ray OR and ray OT are
angle bisectors of Z POS and Z SOQ, respectively. If Z POS =x, find Z ROT.

Solution : Ray OS stands on the line POQ.

Therefore, Z POS + Z SOQ = 180 
But, Z POS =x
Therefore, x + Z SOQ = 180 
So, Z SOQ = 180 x
Now, ray OR bisects Z POS, therefore,

Example 3 : In Fig. 6.11, OP, OQ, OR and OS are
four rays. Prove that 7 POQ + Z QOR + Z SOR +
Z POS = 360 .

Solution : In Fig. 6.11, you need to produce any of
the rays OP, OQ, OR or OS backwards to a point.
Let us produce ray OQ backwards to a point T so
that TOQ is a line (see Fig. 6.12).

Now, ray OP stands on line TOQ.
Therefore, Z TOP + Z POQ = 180 (1)
(Linear pair axiom)
Similarly, ray OS stands on line TOQ.
Therefore, Z TOS + Z SOQ = 180 (2)
But Z SOQ = Z SOR + Z QOR
So, (2) becomes
Z TOS + Z SOR + Z QOR = 180 

Now, adding (1) and (3), you get

Z TOP + Z POQ+ Z TOS + Z SOR + Z QOR = 360 (4)
But Z TOP + Z TOS = Z POS
Therefore, (4) becomes

Z POQ+ Z QOR + Z SOR + Z POS = 360

6.5 Lines Parallel to the Same Line
If two lines are parallel to the same line, will they be parallel to each other? Let us
check it. See Fig. 6.18 in which line m || line / and line 7 || line /.

Let us draw a line transversal for the lines, /, m and n. It is given that
line m || line / and line 7 || line /. t

Therefore, Z1= 22 and Z1=23

(Corresponding angles axiom) 1

So, Z2=Z3 (Why?) 7
But 2 2 and 7 3 are corresponding angles and they 
are equal.
Therefore, you can say that n .
Line m || Line n
(Converse of corresponding angles axiom)
Fig. 6.18

This result can be stated in the form of the following theorem:

Theorem 6.6 : Lines which are parallel to the same line are parallel to each
other.

Note : The property above can be extended to more than two lines also.

Now, let us solve some examples related to parallel lines.

Example 4 : In Fig. 6.19, if PQ || RS, ZMXQ = 135 and Z MYR = 40 , find Z XMY.

P x Q
40 

Fig. 6.19 Fig. 6.20

Solution : Here, we need to draw a line AB parallel to line PQ, through point M as
shown in Fig. 6.20. Now, AB || PQ and PQ || RS.

Reprint 2025-26

LINES AND ANGLES 719

Therefore, AB || RS (Why?)

Now, ZQXM + Z XMB = 180 

(AB || PQ, Interior angles on the same side of the transversal XM)
But Z QXM = 135 
So, 135 + Z XMB = 180 
Therefore, Z XMB = 45 (1)
Now, Z BMY = Z MYR (AB || RS, Alternate angles)
Therefore, Z BMY = 40 (2)

Adding (1) and (2), you get
Z XMB + Z BMY = 45 + 40 
That is, Z XMY = 85 

Example 5 : If a transversal intersects two lines such that the bisectors of a pair of
corresponding angles are parallel, then prove that the two lines are parallel.

Solution : In Fig. 6.21, a transversal AD intersects two lines PQ and RS at points B
and C respectively. Ray BE is the bisector of Z ABQ and ray CG is the bisector of
Z BCS; and BE || CG.

We are to prove that PQ || RS.
It is given that ray BE is the bisector of Z ABQ.
Therefore, Z ABE= 5 Z ABQ (1)

Similarly, ray CG is the bisector of Z BCS.
Therefore, 2BCG= 5 Z BCS (2)

But BE || CG and AD is the transversal.
Therefore, Z ABE= Z BCG

(Corresponding angles axiom) (3)
Substituting (1) and (2) in (3), you get

1 1
7 <ABQ= 7 < BCS

That is, Z ABQ= ZBCS

Reprint 2025-26

80 MATHEMATICS

But, they are the corresponding angles formed by transversal AD with PQ and RS;
and are equal.

Therefore, PQ || RS

(Converse of corresponding angles axiom)

Example 6: In Fig. 6.22, AB || CD and CD || EF. Also EA 1 AB. If 7 BEF = 55 , find
the values of x, y and z.

Solution: y+55 = 180 

(Interior angles on the same side of the
transversal ED)

Therefore, y = 180 55 = 125 
Again x=y

(AB || CD, Corresponding angles axiom)
Therefore x = 125 

Fig. 6.22
Now, since AB || CD and CD || EF, therefore, AB || EF.
So, Z EAB+ Z FEA = 180 (Interior angles on the same

side of the transversal EA)
Therefore, 90 + z+ 55 = 180 
Which gives z= 35
