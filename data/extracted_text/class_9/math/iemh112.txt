12.1 Graphical Representation of Data

The representation of data by tables has already been discussed. Now let us turn our
attention to another representation of data, i.e., the graphical representation. It is well
said that one picture is better than a thousand words. Usually comparisons among the
individual items are best shown by means of graphs. The representation then becomes
easier to understand than the actual data. We shall study the following graphical
representations in this section.

(A) Bar graphs

(B) Histograms of uniform width, and of varying widths

(C) Frequency polygons
(A) Bar Graphs

In earlier classes, you have already studied and constructed bar graphs. Here we
shall discuss them through a more formal approach. Recall that a bar graph is a
pictorial representation of data in which usually bars of uniform width are drawn with
equal spacing between them on one axis (say, the x-axis), depicting the variable. The
values of the variable are shown on the other axis (say, the y-axis) and the heights of
the bars depend on the values of the variable.

Example 1 : In a particular section of Class IX, 40 students were asked about the
months of their birth and the following graph was prepared for the data so obtained:

Observe the bar graph given above and answer the following questions:
(i) |. How many students were born in the month of November?
(ii) In which month were the maximum number of students born?

Solution : Note that the variable here is the month of birth , and the value of the
variable is the Number of students born .

(1) 4 students were born in the month of November.
(ii) The Maximum number of students were born in the month of August.
Let us now recall how a bar graph is constructed by considering the following example.

Example 2 : A family with a monthly income of = 20,000 had planned the following
expenditures per month under various heads:

Table 12.1

Draw a bar graph for the data above.

Reprint 2025-26

STATISTICS 153

Solution : We draw the bar graph of this data in the following steps. Note that the unit
in the second column is thousand rupees. So, *4 against grocery means ~4000.

1. We represent the Heads (variable) on the horizontal axis choosing any scale,
since the width of the bar is not important. But for clarity, we take equal widths
for all bars and maintain equal gaps in between. Let one Head be represented by
one unit.

2. We represent the expenditure (value) on the vertical axis. Since the maximum
expenditure is 5000, we can choose the scale as | unit = 71000.

3. To represent our first Head, i.e., grocery, we draw a rectangular bar with width
1 unit and height 4 units.

4. Similarly, other Heads are represented leaving a gap of | unit in between two
consecutive bars.

The bar graph is drawn in Fig. 12.2.

Here, you can easily visualise the relative characteristics of the data at a glance, e.g.,
the expenditure on education is more than double that of medical expenses. Therefore,
in some ways it serves as a better representation of data than the tabular form.

Activity 1 : Continuing with the same four groups of Activity 1, represent the data by
suitable bar graphs.

Let us now see how a frequency distribution table for continuous class intervals
can be represented graphically.

Reprint 2025-26

154 MATHEMATICS

(B) Histogram

This is a form of representation like the bar graph, but it is used for continuous class
intervals. For instance, consider the frequency distribution Table 12.2, representing
the weights of 36 students of a class:

Table 12.2

Let us represent the data given above graphically as follows:

(1) We represent the weights on the horizontal axis ona suitable scale. We can choose
the scale as | cm = 5 kg. Also, since the first class interval is starting from 30.5
and not zero, we show it on the graph by marking a kink or a break on the axis.

(ii) We represent the number of students (frequency) on the vertical axis on a suitable
scale. Since the maximum frequency is 15, we need to choose the scale to
accomodate this maximum frequency.

(iit) We now draw rectangles (or rectangular bars) of width equal to the class-size
and lengths according to the frequencies of the corresponding class intervals. For
example, the rectangle for the class interval 30.5 - 35.5 will be of width 1 cm and
length 4.5 cm.

(iv) In this way, we obtain the graph as shown in Fig. 12.3:

Fig, 12.3

Observe that since there are no gaps in between consecutive rectangles, the resultant
graph appears like a solid figure. This is called a histogram, which is a graphical
representation of a grouped frequency distribution with continuous classes. Also, unlike
a bar graph, the width of the bar plays a significant role in its construction.

Here, in fact, areas of the rectangles erected are proportional to the corresponding
frequencies. However, since the widths of the rectangles are all equal, the lengths of
the rectangles are proportional to the frequencies. That is why, we draw the lengths
according to (iti) above.

Now, consider a situation different from the one above.

Example 3 : A teacher wanted to analyse the performance of two sections of students
in a mathematics test of 100 marks. Looking at their performances, she found that a
few students got under 20 marks and a few got 70 marks or above. So she decided to
group them into intervals of varying sizes as follows: 0 - 20, 20 - 30, .. ., 60 - 70,
70 - 100. Then she formed the following table:

Fig. 12.4

Carefully examine this graphical representation. Do you think that it correctly represents
the data? No, the graph is giving us a misleading picture. As we have mentioned
earlier, the areas of the rectangles are proportional to the frequencies in a histogram.
Earlier this problem did not arise, because the widths of all the rectangles were equal.
But here, since the widths of the rectangles are varying, the histogram above does not

Reprint 2025-26

give a correct picture. For example, it shows a greater frequency in the interval
70 - 100, than in 60 - 70, which is not the case.

So, we need to make certain modifications in the lengths of the rectangles so that
the areas are again proportional to the frequencies.

The steps to be followed are as given below:

1. Selecta class interval with the minimum class size. In the example above, the
minimum class-size is 10.

2. The lengths of the rectangles are then modified to be proportionate to the
class-size 10.

For instance, when the class-size is 20, the length of the rectangle is 7. So when
the class-size is 10, the length of the rectangle will be 30 x 10=3.5.

Similarly, proceeding in this manner, we get the following table:

20 - 30 10 10 10=10

4 = =

70 - 100 8 30 30 x 10= 2.67

MATHEMATICS

Since we have calculated these lengths for an interval of 10 marks in each case,
we may call these lengths as proportion of students per 10 marks interval .

So, the correct histogram with varying width is given in Fig. 12.5.

(C) Frequency Polygon

There is yet another visual way of representing quantitative data and its frequencies.
This is a polygon. To see what we mean, consider the histogram represented by
Fig. 12.3. Let us join the mid-points of the upper sides of the adjacent rectangles of
this histogram by means of line segments. Let us call these mid-points B, C, D, E, F
and G. When joined by line segments, we obtain the figure BCDEFG (see Fig. 12.6).
To complete the polygon, we assume that there is a class interval with frequency zero

Reprint 2025-26

STATISTICS 159

before 30.5 - 35.5, and one after 55.5 - 60.5, and their mid-points are A and H,
respectively. ABCDEFGH is the frequency polygon corresponding to the data shown
in Fig. 12.3. We have shown this in Fig. 12.6.

Although, there exists no class preceding the lowest class and no class succeeding
the highest class, addition of the two class intervals with zero frequency enables us to
make the area of the frequency polygon the same as the area of the histogram. Why
is this so? (Hint : Use the properties of congruent triangles.)

Now, the question arises: how do we complete the polygon when there is no class
preceding the first class? Let us consider such a situation.

Example 4 : Consider the marks, out of 100, obtained by 51 students of a class in a
test, given in Table 12.5.

Table 12.5

Draw a frequency polygon corresponding to this frequency distribution table.

Solution : Let us first draw a histogram for this data and mark the mid-points of the
tops of the rectangles as B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, respectively. Here, the first class is
0-10. So, to find the class preceeding 0-10, we extend the horizontal axis in the negative
direction and find the mid-point of the imaginary class-interval ( 10) - 0. The first end
point, 1.e., B is joined to this mid-point with zero frequency on the negative direction of
the horizontal axis. The point where this line segment meets the vertical axis is marked
as A. Let L be the mid-point of the class succeeding the last class of the given data.
Then OABCDEFGHIJKL is the frequency polygon, which is shown in Fig. 12.7.

Frequency polygons can also be drawn independently without drawing
histograms. For this, we require the mid-points of the class-intervals used in the data.
These mid-points of the class-intervals are called class-marks.

To find the class-mark of a class interval, we find the sum of the upper limit and
lower limit of a class and divide it by 2. Thus,

Upper limit + Lower limit
Class-mark =

Let us consider an example.

Example 5: Ina city, the weekly observations made in a study on the cost of living
index are given in the following table:

Draw a frequency polygon for the data above (without constructing a histogram).

Solution : Since we want to draw a frequency polygon without a histogram, let us find
the class-marks of the classes given above, that is of 140 - 150, 150 - 160.....

For 140 - 150, the upper limit = 150, and the lower limit = 140

We can now draw a frequency polygon by plotting the class-marks along the horizontal
axis, the frequencies along the vertical-axis, and then plotting and joining the points
B(145, 5), C(155, 10), D(165, 20), E(175, 9), F185, 6) and G(195, 2) by line segments.
We should not forget to plot the point corresponding to the class-mark of the class

A(135, 0), and the point H (205, 0) occurs immediately after G(195, 2). So, the resultant
frequency polygon will be ABCDEFGH (see Fig. 12.8).

very useful for comparing two different sets of data of the same nature, for example,
comparing the performance of two different sections of the same class.
