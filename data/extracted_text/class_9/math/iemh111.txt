11.1 Surface Area of a Right Circular Cone

We have already studied the surface areas of cube, cuboid and cylinder. We will now
study the surface area of cone.

So far, we have been generating solids by stacking up congruent figures. Incidentally,
such figures are called prisms. Now let us look at another kind of solid which is not a
prism (These kinds of solids are called pyramids.). Let us see how we can generate
them.

Activity : Cut out a right-angled triangle ABC right angled at B. Paste a long thick
string along one of the perpendicular sides say AB of the triangle [see Fig. 11.1(a)].
Hold the string with your hands on either sides of the triangle and rotate the triangle
about the string a number of times. What happens? Do you recognize the shape that
the triangle is forming as it rotates around the string [see Fig. 11.1(b)]? Does it remind
you of the time you had eaten an ice-cream heaped into a container of that shape [see
Fig. 11.1 (c) and (d)]?

This is called a right circular cone. In Fig. 11.1(c)
of the right circular cone, the point A is called the
vertex, AB is called the height, BC is called the radius
and AC is called the slant height of the cone. Here B
will be the centre of circular base of the cone. The
height, radius and slant height of the cone are usually
denoted by h, r and / respectively. Once again, let us
see what kind of cone we can not call a right circular
cone. Here, you are (see Fig. 11.2)! What you see in
these figures are not right circular cones; because in
(a), the line joining its vertex to the centre of its base
is not at right angle to the base, and in (b) the base is
not circular.

As in the case of cylinder, since we will be studying only about right circular cones,
remember that by cone in this chapter, we shall mean a right circular cone. 

Activity : (i) Cut out a neatly made paper cone that does not have any overlapped
paper, straight along its side, and opening it out, to see the shape of paper that forms
the surface of the cone. (The line along which you cut the cone is the slant height of
the cone which is represented by /). It looks like a part of a round cake.

(ii) Ifyou now bring the sides marked A and B at the tips together, you can see that
the curved portion of Fig. 11.3 (c) will form the circular base of the cone.

(iit) Ifthe paper like the one in Fig. 11.3 (c) is now cut into hundreds of little pieces,
along the lines drawn from the point O, each cut portion is almost a small triangle,

whose height is the slant height / of the cone.
(iv) Now the area of each triangle = 5 x base of each triangle ~ /.

So, area of the entire piece of paper

(as b, + b, + b, +... makes up the curved portion of the figure)

But the curved portion of the figure makes up the perimeter of the base of the cone
and the circumference of the base of the cone = 2mr, where r is the base radius of the
cone.

So, |Curved Surface Area of a Cone = </X 2nr=nrl a YZ

Note that ? = 7 + /? (as can be seen from Fig. 11.4), by i

cone.

Therefore, /= fr? + 8

Now if the base of the cone is to be closed, then a circular piece of paper of radius r
is also required whose area is 7 .

So,| Total Surface Area of a Cone = arl + nr? = amr(J + r)

Example 1 : Find the curved surface area of a right circular cone whose slant height
is 10 cm and base radius is 7 cm.

Solution : Curved surface area = trl
7 x 7x 10 cm?

220 cm?

Example 2 : The height of a cone is 16 cm and its base radius is 12 cm. Find the
curved surface area and the total surface area of the cone (Use z = 3.14).

Solution : Here, A = 16 cm and r= 12 cm.

So, from 7? = h? + 7 , we have

I= 16? +12? cm=20cm

Reprint 2025-26

140 MATHEMATICS

So, curved surface area = mrl
= 3.14 x 12 x 20 cm?
= 753.6 cm?
Further, total surface area = mr] + mr?
= (753.6 + 3.14 x 12 x 12) cm?
= (753.6 + 452.16) cm?
= 1205.76 cm?

Example 3 : A corn cob (see Fig. 11.5), shaped somewhat
like a cone, has the radius of its broadest end as 2.1 cm and
length (height) as 20 cm. If each 1 cm? of the surface of the
cob carries an average of four grains, find how many grains Fig. 11.5
you would find on the entire cob.

Solution : Since the grains of corn are found only on the curved surface of the corn
cob, we would need to know the curved surface area of the corn cob to find the total
number of grains on it. In this question, we are given the height of the cone, so we
need to find its slant height.

Here, 1= Jr? +h? = J(2.1? +20? om

= ./404.41 cm = 20.11 cm

Therefore, the curved surface area of the corn cob = 7/1
=a * 2.1 x 20.11 cm? = 132.726 cm? = 132.73 cm? (approx.)

Number of grains of corn on | cm? of the surface of the corn cob = 4
Therefore, number of grains on the entire curved surface of the cob
= 132.73 x 4= 530.92 = 531 (approx.)

So, there would be approximately 531 grains of corn on the cob.

11.2 Surface Area of a Sphere

What is a sphere? Is it the same as a circle? Can you draw a circle on a paper? Yes,
you can, because a circle is a plane closed figure whose every point lies at a constant
distance (called radius) from a fixed point, which is called the centre of the circle.
Now if you paste a string along a diameter of a circular disc and rotate it as you had
rotated the triangle in the previous section, you see a new solid (see Fig 11.6). What
does it resemble? A ball? Yes. It is called a sphere.

Fig. 11.6

Reprint 2025-26

142 MATHEMATICS

Can you guess what happens to the centre of the circle, when it forms a sphere on
rotation? Of course, it becomes the centre of the sphere. So, a sphere is a three
dimensional figure (solid figure), which is made up of all points in the space,
which lie at a constant distance called the radius, from a fixed point called the
centre of the sphere.

Note : A sphere is like the surface of a ball. The word solid sphere is used for the
solid whose surface is a sphere.

Activity : Have you ever played with a top or have you at least watched someone
play with one? You must be aware of how a string is wound around it. Now, let us take
a rubber ball and drive a nail into it. Taking support of the nail, let us wind a string
around the ball. When you have reached the fullest part of the ball, use pins to keep
the string in place, and continue to wind the string around the remaining part of the ball,
till you have completely covered the ball [see Fig. 11.7(a)]. Mark the starting and
finishing points on the string, and slowly unwind the string from the surface of the ball.

Now, ask your teacher to help you in measuring the diameter of the ball, from which
you easily get its radius. Then on a sheet of paper, draw four circles with radius equal
to the radius of the ball. Start filling the circles one by one, with the string you had
wound around the ball [see Fig. 11.7(b)].

(b)
Fig. 11.7

What have you achieved in all this?

The string, which had completely covered the surface area of the sphere, has been
used to completely fill the regions of four circles, all of the same radius as of the sphere.

So, what does that mean? This suggests that the surface area of a sphere of radius r

= 4 times the area of a circle of radius r = 4 x (1 r )

So, Surface Area of a Sphere = 4 2 7

where r is the radius of the sphere.

How many faces do you see in the surface of a sphere? There is only one, which is
curved.

Now, let us take a solid sphere, and slice it exactly through
the middle with a plane that passes through its centre. What
happens to the sphere?

Yes, it gets divided into two equal parts (see Fig. 11.8)! What
will each half be called? It is called a hemisphere. (Because
 hemi also means half )

Fig. 11.8

And what about the surface of a hemisphere? How many faces does it have?
Two! There is a curved face and a flat face (base).

The curved surface area of a hemisphere is half the surface area of the sphere, which
is > of 427 .

Therefore, | Curved Surface Area of a Hemisphere = 2x 

where r is the radius of the sphere of which the hemisphere is a part.

Now taking the two faces of a hemisphere, its surface area 277 + mr?

So,| Total Surface Area of a Hemisphere = 327 

Example 4 : Find the surface area of a sphere of radius 7 cm.

Solution : The surface area of a sphere of radius 7 cm would be
Anr = 4 x > x 7x 7 cm? = 616 cm?

Example 5 : Find (1) the curved surface area and (ii) the total surface area of a
hemisphere of radius 21 cm.

Solution : The curved surface area of a hemisphere of radius 21 cm would be

Example 6 : The hollow sphere, in which the circus motorcyclist performs his stunts,
has a diameter of 7 m. Find the area available to the motorcyclist for riding.

Solution : Diameter of the sphere = 7 m. Therefore, radius is 3.5 m. So, the riding
space available for the motorcyclist is the surface area of the sphere which is
given by
4nr? = 4 x 7 x 3.5 x 3.5 m?
= 154 m?

Example 7 : A hemispherical dome of a building needs to be painted
(see Fig. 11.9). If the circumference of the base of the dome is 17.6 m, find the cost of
painting it, given the cost of painting is 5 per 100 cm .

Solution : Since only the rounded surface of the dome is to be painted, we would need
to find the curved surface area of the hemisphere to know the extent of painting that
needs to be done. Now, circumference of the dome = 17.6 m. Therefore, 17.6 = 27r.

m=2.8m

So, the radius of the dome = 17.6 x u
2x22
The curved surface area of the dome = 27 
=2*x ze x 2.8 x 2.8 m?

= 49.28 m?

Now, cost of painting 100 cm? is & 5.

So, cost of painting 1 m? == 500

Therefore, cost of painting the whole dome

11.3 Volume of a Right Circular Cone

radius and the same height?

Activity : Try to make a hollow cylinder and a hollow cone like this with the same

So, let us start like this.

Fill the cone up to the brim with sand once, and empty it into the cylinder. We find
that it fills up only a part of the cylinder [see Fig. 11.12(a)].

When we fill up the cone again to the brim, and empty it into the cylinder, we see
that the cylinder is still not full [see Fig. 11.12(b)].

When the cone is filled up for the third time, and emptied into the cylinder, it can be
seen that the cylinder is also full to the brim [see Fig. 11.12(c)].

With this, we can safely come to the conclusion that three times the volume of a
cone, makes up the volume of a cylinder, which has the same base radius and the
same height as the cone, which means that the volume of the cone is one-third the
volume of the cylinder.
So, Volume of a Cone = 3th

where + is the base radius and / is the height of the cone.

Example 8 : The height and the slant height ofa cone are 21 cm and 28 cm respectively.
Find the volume of the cone.

Solution : From [ =r ? + h , we have

So, volume of the cone = 3 trh = 3 x 7 x W7 x 77 x 21 em:

Example 9 : Monica has a piece of canvas whose area is 551 m?. She uses it to have
a conical tent made, with a base radius of 7 m. Assuming that all the stitching margins
and the wastage incurred while cutting, amounts to approximately 1 m7, find the volume
of the tent that can be made with it.

Solution : Since the area of the canvas = 551 m and area of the canvas lost in
wastage is | m , therefore the area of canvas available for making the tent is
(551 1) m* = 550 m .

Now, the surface area of the tent = 550 m? and the required base radius of the conical
tent = 7m

Note that a tent has only a curved surface (the floor of a tent is not covered by
canvas!!).

Therefore, curved surface area of tent = 550 m .

11.4 Volume of a Sphere

Now, let us see how to go about measuring the volume of a sphere. First, take two or
three spheres of different radii, and a container big enough to be able to put each of
the spheres into it, one at a time. Also, take a large trough in which you can place the
container. Then, fill the container up to the brim with water [see Fig. 11.13(a)].

Now, carefully place one of the spheres in the container. Some of the water from
the container will over flow into the trough in which it is kept [see Fig. 11.13(b)].
Carefully pour out the water from the trough into a measuring cylinder (1.e., a graduated
cylindrical jar) and measure the water over flowed [see Fig. 11.13(c)]. Suppose the
radius of the immersed sphere is 7 (you can find the radius by measuring the diameter
of the sphere). Then evaluate 3 mr . Do you find this value almost equal to the

measure of the volume over flowed?

(a) (b) (c)
Fig. 11.13
Once again repeat the procedure done just now, with a different size of sphere.
Find the radius R of this sphere and then calculate the value of ym. Once again this

value is nearly equal to the measure of the volume of the water displaced (over flowed)
by the sphere. What does this tell us? We know that the volume of the sphere is the
same as the measure of the volume of the water displaced by it. By doing this experiment
repeatedly with spheres of varying radii, we are getting the same result, namely, the

volume of a sphere is equal to 37 times the cube of its radius. This gives us the idea
that
Volume of a Sphere = rule

where r is the radius of the sphere.

Later, in higher classes it can be proved also. But at this stage, we will just take it
as true.
