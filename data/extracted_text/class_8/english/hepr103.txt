nickname: oh

name
Encyclopedia Brown is a young boy who lives in Idaville, USA.
His father is the Chief of Police. In spite of being so young he
often helps his father solve mysteries that even the police find
difficult to solve. Their discussions are generally held at the
dining table. Read this story to find out how the boy wonder
solves a case that has been troubling his father...

Encyclopedia s father was Chief of Police. Everyone thought
that he must be the smartest police chief in the country. Chief
Brown was smart and quick. He didn t sit around and worry.
When he came up against a case he couldn t solve, he acted
at once. He cleared his desk, put on his hat, and went home
to dinner. Encyclopedia solved the case for him before dinner
was over.

Chief Brown would have liked to tell everyone about his only
child. But who would believe him? Who would believe that the
best detective alive was an eighth grader? So, he said nothing.

Encyclopedia never spoke of the help he gave his father. He
didn t want to seem different from other boys. But there was
nothing he could do about his nickname. He was stuck with it.

Only his parents and teachers called him by his real name,
Leroy. Everyone else called him Encyclopedia.

An encyclopedia is a book or set of books filled with facts from
A to Z. So was Encyclopedia s head. He read more books than

anyone in Idaville, and he never forgot a fact. His pals said
he was like a library and computer rolled into one, and more
user-friendly.

At the dinner table on Tuesday night, Chief Brown stared at
his cream-of-mushroom soup. Encyclopedia and his mother
knew what that meant. He had a mystery he could not solve.

 Tim Nolan died yesterday, he announced in a matter-of-fact
manner.

 That name is familiar, Mrs. Brown said. Wasn t he mixed
up in a jewellery robbery a few years ago? 

 Five years ago, Chief Brown replied. Two masked men held
up the Diamond Mart on Sixth Avenue. They got away witha
million dollars worth of jewellery. 

 I thought Tim Nolan was arrested, Mrs. Brown said.
 He was questioned, not arrested, Chief Brown corrected.

 I always believed that Nolan and a friend, a man named
Daniel Davenport, pulled the hold-ups. There wasn t any
proof, though. 

Encyclopedia sat quietly. He knew his mother and father were
discussing the case for his benefit.

His father filled in the facts.

 Nolan and Davenport had met, Chief Brown said, while
both were in prison in South Carolina. They became friendly
because of shared interests.
Nolan was let out first.
He settled in Idaville
and started a small
palm-tree nursery. It
barely yielded him a
living.

gunman s mask slipped. A clerk thought she recognised
Nolan. But she wasn t absolutely sure. 

 I remember now, Mrs. Brown said. The clerk refused to
testify against him, and no trace of the stolen jewellery ever
turned up. 

 Davenport hasn t been seen since the hold-up, Chief Brown
said. My hunch is that he and Nolan decided to hide the loot
until things cooled down. 

 Didn t you search Nolan s house, dear? 

 I got a court order this morning, Chief Brown said. Officers
Lewis and Maloney just about took Nolan s house apart. They
didn t find one piece of the stolen jewellery. 

 Is there some mystery about Nolan s death yesterday? 
Mrs. Brown inquired.

 Yes and no, Chief Brown answered. Nolan suffered from
a bad heart for many years. Yesterday morning he had a
stroke. He must have realised he was dying. With his last
strength, he managed to put his will on the kitchen table.
It leaves everything he owns, including his palm-tree nursery
to Davenport.

 As Dad said, Davenport and Nolan must
have hidden the stolen jewellery. Probably
not a week or so ago, Nolan changed the
hiding place. 

 You think that he tried to tell Davenport by
phone and failed to reach him? Mrs. Brown
asked. So he wrote the four words as he was
dying? 
Chief Brown nodded. We'll find Davenport now
that we know his address. 

 He ll learn he has been left the palm-tree nursery, Mrs.
Brown said. And the four words will tell him where the
jewellery is hidden! 

code: hidden Right, Encyclopedia said. The code is simple, especially

understand it easily. Still, it wouldn t make much sense to
someone who isn t looking for a hiding place.

\ Mrs. Brown looked ready to explode

with impatience, Where? 
Encyclopedia smiled.

 Why, under the fifth word, he said.
What Was The Fifth Word?
To tell Davenport where he had hidden the stolen jewellery,
Nolan wrote a four-word code.

As the key to the code, he wrote the four words on a sheet
from a desk calendar.

The four words stood for days of the week.

Nolan dropped the letters d-a-y. Then he used the other letters
to form words.

So, Nom = Monday, Utes = Tuesday, Sweden = Wednesday and
Hurts = Thursday.

The unwritten fifth word was Fir, or Friday.

The jewellery was found inside a twenty-gallon jug of earth
from which grew the young fir tree in Nolan s nursery just
as Encyclopedia had foreseen.

While Gopi paints a winding road,
A horse both strong and bold.

The road leads out of prison gates.

Gopi leaps on and gallops fast,
Through fields and many villages.

 It s Gopi! It s Gopi! She s back again!

Imaginative essay is a type of creative writing where the writers use
their imagination. An imaginative essay can be based on real-life
events, observation, or experiences. It is usually a descriptive piece or a
personal reflection.

Read the sample of an imaginative essay.

My Life as EcoFlash

Imagine an ordinary 13-year-old student who is also a
secret superhero protecting the environment. That s my
life as EcoFlash! By day, m Meenu, an ordinary Grade
8 student. By evening, I use my powers to keep my
neighbourhood green and clean.

As EcoFlash, I have the ability to grow plants, purify
water, and clean polluted air with a wave of my hand.
I wear a green suit with a glowing leaf symbol and carry
a small seed pouch that holds magic seeds to restore
damaged areas. My mission is to fight pollution, save
trees, and educate people about taking care of our planet.
My friends wonder why I m always carrying a plant in
my bag or why my shoes are muddy, but I can never tell
them the truth.

Once, my little brother saw me turning a garbage dump into a beautiful
garden and almost spilled my secret to our parents. I had to convince
him it was a magic trick!

Being EcoFlash is not just about powers but also responsibility. Every
time I see clean streets, blooming flowers, and children playing in green
parks, I feel proud. I know that even small changes can make a big
difference, and that s what keeps me going.

India is home to some of the most mystifying natural
phenomena that surprise and spark our imagination.

1. THE VALLEY OF FLOWERS, UTTARAKHAND

The Valley of Flowers is an eyecatching spectacle with around
600 species of exotic flowers,
including orchids, poppies,
primulas, marigold, daisies, and
anemones. It is a place where
nature blooms in its full glory
offering an attractive view.
The trek to the valley offers spectacular views of beautiful
waterfalls and wild streams. The valley is also home to rare
wildlife species like the grey langur, flying squirrel, red fox,
lime butterfly, and snow leopard, to name a few.

With a stunning backdrop of the mighty Himalayan ranges,
the Valley of Flowers National Park presents an unforgettable
experience for visitors. Spread over a huge area in the Chamoli
district, the Valley of Flowers National Park isa UNESCO World
Heritage Site. Between the months of May and October, this
area turns into a botanical wonderland!

2. THE Livinc Root Bripces, MEGHALAYA

Imagine building a_ bridge
without the use of cement,
stones, concrete, etc. Is it
possible? The living root
bridges are incredible feats
of engineering built by
the indigenous people of
Meghalaya. The living root
bridges are one of Meghalaya s most beautiful tangible
UNESCO world heritage sites.

Crossing the many waterways without bridges was difficult
for people in the past, during monsoons.

Attempts to use bamboo or wooden bridges across these
waterways proved futile as these bridges could not last long
in the heavy rains and strong waters. Living root bridges
are an innovative and indigenous solution to solve this
age-old problem.

They are made of intertwined roots which are a sort of magic,
but they aren t imaginary. These bridges have been built for
centuries by the indigenous people of the land. It is a naturally
built ecosystem oflocal flora. It also symbolises the relationship
and knowledge that the local people have over their region
and the cultural significance that it holds for them. Under
ideal conditions, a root bridge is thought to be able to persist
for hundreds of years. These bridges frequently rise 50 to 100
feet in the air. The state s longest living root bridge is said to
be a whopping 175 feet in length. There are approximately
100 or so known living root bridges across different villages.

3. THE LONAR CRATER LAKE, MAHARASHTRA

The Lonar Crater Lake is a
geological wonder, nestled in
the town of Lonar in Buldhana
district, Maharashtra. It is
believed to have been formed
thousands of years ago. This
ancient landform, consisting
of a giant hole, came into
existence when a colossal meteorite, blazing at an extremely
high speed, crashed into the Earth, leaving behind a stunning
mark. It is the only crater in India formed in basaltic rock by
a meteorite impact and ranks as the third largest in the world,
placing it among the top five largest craters globally.

The crater s perfectly circular depression cradles a unique
saline lake at its core, creating a striking visual contrast
against the surrounding rugged terrain. This site is a rare and
extraordinary blend of celestial impact and terrestrial beauty.
The rim of the meteor crater offers a breath-taking spectacle
of nature s power and the enduring allure of our planet s
ancient past.

4. MaGnetic HILLs IN Lew District, LADAKH

In the travels around
Leh-Ladakh, is a fascinating
sight which arouses curiosity
to no end the Magnetic Hill,
a place where gravity takes a
backseat!

Lying at a distance of around
30 km from Leh, the Magnetic
Hill is marked by a yellow signboard which reads The
Phenomenon That Defies Gravity . It also instructs visitors to
park vehicles in the box marked with a white point on the road,
which is known as the Magnetic Road. When the vehicles are
parked at the indicated spot, they begin moving forward at a
speed of almost 20km/h. This unusual place creates an optical
illusion where vehicles appear to roll uphill, a sight that has
left tourists in disbelief for years, caused by the peculiar
alignment of surrounding slopes and the horizon line.

5. GLowInG WartERS OF KERALA

Situated 15 kms from Kerala s

Kochi town, Kumbalangi
is a beautiful village with
vast green vegetation.

In the serene backwaters of
Kumbalangi village, one can
see magically glowing waters
in the night.

This phenomenon is called bioluminescence, and is caused
by a high concentration of micro-planktons in the sea, which
are small organisms found in marine and freshwater. This
beautiful sight has captured the attention of locals as well
as tourists, making Kumbalangi an eco-tourism village in
India. One can experience the village life in all its beauty and
simplicity, and acquaint oneself to their cuisine and culture.

6. THE SUNDARBANS

Can a forest exist in a coastal
zone? Yes, they are called
mangrove forests, where
trees take root under water in
the low-oxygen soil. The roots
slow down the movement
of tidal waters, stabilising
the coastline and reducing
erosion. The Sundarbans is one such mangrove forest spread
over 1,400 kms in West Bengal, lying in the delta of rivers, such
as the Ganga, the Brahmaputra, and the Meghna. The name is
derived from sundari trees that are plentiful in the area.

The area is also populated by an extensive range of flora and
fauna, including many bird species, the majestic Bengal tiger, 
and other threatened species, such as the estuarine crocodile
and the Indian python.

7. THE INVISIBLE CHANDIPUR BEACH, ODISHA

This happens in Odisha. It is a beach in the Balasore
district where one can witness the sea disappearing
mysteriously the Chandipur Beach which is known for its
unique feature of playing hide-and-seek with its visitors.

The sea can actually be witnessed disappearing and
reappearing. This is because the sea water moves. It retreats
by 2-5 km during ebb tide, the duration between the high tide
and low tide, and comes back to the shore at the time of high
tide. This unusual natural phenomenon keeps on happening

I You will listen to a podcast about ways of improving observation skills.
As you listen, mark true or false for the statements 1-4.

Hello everyone! In today s episode, we ll be discussing some
simple but effective ways to improve our observation skills.
Being observant isn t just about seeing, it s about truly noticing
details in the world around us. Whether it s in daily life or in
the workplace, observation skills can help us become more
aware, make better decisions, and even improve memory. Let s
get started!

First, slow down and take your time. Rushing through tasks often
leads to missed details. When you take time to focus on what s
in front of you, you re more likely to notice features you might
otherwise overlook. When you pause and observe, the details
become clearer.

Another effective method is to engage all your senses. Observation
isn t just about seeing; it s also about hearing, smelling, touching,
and even tasting. The more senses you engage, the more
information you absorb. For example, when you re in a new
environment, don t just look around pay attention to sounds,
smells, and textures too.

A third tip is to ask questions. Curious people tend to be better
observers because they actively try to understand what they re
noticing. Asking questions about what you see, like Why is this
here? or What purpose does it serve? forces your brain to
think critically about what you re observing.

Next, take notes or make sketches. Writing down what
you observe can help reinforce details in your memory.
Even quick sketches of an object or place can strengthen your
understanding of its features.

 

Finally, it s important to practise mindfulness. Mindfulness helps

~ - you stay present in the moment and fully engage with your

> ; & ~ surroundings. When you re mindful, you re not distracted by
. anything, this leads to improved observation skills.

Start incorporating these techniques into your daily routine, and
soon you'll be observing things you never noticed before!

I liked the pictures Uncle Dileep posted yesterday
from the Republic of Peru. Can you guess which was
my favourite?

: I know it was the Rainbow Mountain. I say that

because it was certainly my favourite.

Really! I didn t know it was your favourite too.
Can you imagine the creativity in Nature? What a
marvellous natural phenomenon!

: I could not believe my eyes when I saw that picture.

There are so many colours there. Do you know how
it s formed?

Of course! It s actually quite amazing. The mountain
gets its colours from layers of minerals like clay,
limestone, and sandstone that got deposited millions
of years ago.

: Wow, I read that too. I think each colour is due to a

different mineral. Like, the green comes from copper,
and the red from clay. It s like nature painted the
mountain!

I cannot believe the fact that it was all buried under
snow until recently.

: Oh! The melting snow must have made it visible

again. That s why it looks so fresh and bright today.

Those layers of minerals were actually deposited by
water from ancient seas and lakes.

: Each colour represents a different time in history.

That s why it s called the rainbow mountain.
