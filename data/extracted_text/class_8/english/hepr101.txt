Let us read

The Vijayanagara Empire was renowned for its glory, wealth,
and cultural achievements. Among its many illustrious rulers,
King Krishnadeva Raya (ruled 1509-29 CE) stood out as a wise
and powerful monarch. His reign is often referred to as the
Golden Era of the Vijayanagara Empire, a
time when art, literature, and architecture
flourished. A great patron of learning,
Krishnadeva Raya was not only an eminent
warrior but also a gifted poet. His works,
such as the epic Amuktamalyada and the
Sanskrit drama Jambavati Parinayam, are
acclaimed even today.

Krishnadeva Raya s court was home to eight celebrated poets,
collectively known as the Ashtadiggajas. These poets, including
Allasani Peddana and Tenali Ramakrishna, enriched the literary
tradition with their masterpieces. Tenali Ramakrishna, in
particular, was known for his quick wit and humour, earning
him a special place in the king s court as both a poet and a witty
advisor. His clever solutions to seemingly insurmountable
problems made him a beloved figure in the empire s history.

Even the wisest rulers face moments of disharmony, and at one
such time, the king had a quarrel with his queen, Thirumalambal,
over a seemingly trivial matter. For weeks, he did not utter a
single word to her, and in his frustration, stopped visiting her
altogether. His absence cast a shadow over the palace, and the
once cheerful corridors seemed quiet and forlorn.

Thirumalambal, distraught and upset, tried her best to resolve
the issue but failed. With no other alternative, she

decided to seek the help of Tenali Rama,
the court s brilliant and witty poet. Rama
listened patiently as the queen recounted
the incident in detail.

 The king wrote a poem, she began, her
voice trembling. It was filled with vague
expressions sun, moon, stars, beautiful
sky but it made no sense. When he tried

reciting it to his ministers, they all avoided him, making excuses.
It was late evening when he came to me, seeking an audience. He
began reciting it to me, but I was so exhausted after a tiring day
that I yawned not once, but several times. The king thought I
was disrespecting his poem and stormed off. Since then, he has
not spoken to me. If I had known this would happen I would
have chosen another day. Help me, please, Rama. Only you can
help the king understand. 

Rama nodded thoughtfully. If you like, I will try my best to
resolve this matter, Your Highness. But this needs a well-planned
approach, and I may need time to find the right strategy. The
queen, who had placed her last hope in Rama, agreed and
thanked him profusely.

The next morning, the royal court was bustling with activity.
Ministers, scholars, and courtiers filled the courtroom, its
intricately carved pillars towering towards the high ceiling. Rays
of sunlight streamed through the open windows, illuminating
the floor adorned with exquisite rugs. Despite the lively chatter,
a tension hung in the air. The king sat on his ornate throne,
his expression stern, his sharp eyes scanning the room. It was
evident that the unresolved quarrel still gnawed at him.

The court discussion was centred on improving paddy cultivation
in the empire. One by one, the ministers rose to present their
ideas. Some suggested expanding irrigation networks, while
others advocated for better manure. Amid these suggestions,
Tenali Rama stood quietly at the edge of the court, observing
everyone with an amused smile.

Finally, the king called upon Rama. The chatter in the court died
down as all eyes turned to him. Rama approached the throne,
carrying a plateful of paddy seeds. Bowing low, he began, Your
Majesty, I bring you a revolutionary type of paddy seeds. If
these are sown, the yield will be three times greater than the
current results. 

A murmur swept through the room. One of the courtiers, known
for his sarcasm, whispered just loud enough to be heard, I
wonder if these are magic seeds! Next, he ll claim they grow
without water. Another muttered, Perhaps he found them on
the moon! Snickers rippled through the court.

The king frowned, unimpressed. That sounds absurd, he
muttered. Such cultivation would need special soil, manure,
and pest and insect repellents. If, by chance, something were to
go wrong, our farmers would suffer. 

Rama smiled, unfazed. That may be true, Your Majesty, but the
real issue lies not with the seeds themselves but with the person
who sows them.

A hush fell over the court as Rama s words hung in the air.
The king s eyebrows furrowed. What is wrong with the person
who sows the seeds? Speak clearly, Rama! he roared.

Rama glanced around the court, his sharp gaze meeting the
sceptical eyes of the courtiers. If one were to sow seeds without
proper care, no one would reap a good harvest, he said, pausing
for effect. And what if the person had a habit of yawning while
sowing? Wouldn t the seeds scatter unevenly? 

The court erupted into laughter, the earlier sarcasm replaced
by genuine amusement. Even the king, caught off guard, sighed
and instinctively yawned. Rama watched him keenly, then
continued, Your Majesty, is there anyone in this world who does
not yawn? It is as natural as breathing. 

The king s expression shifted as realisation dawned. His mind
raced back to the quarrel with the queen. He remembered
scolding her harshly for yawning while he recited his poem.
He realised how unfair he had been. IfI had known that yawning
was not a sign of disrespect, I wouldn t have taken her gesture
so personally, he thought, regret filling his heart.

That evening, the king approached the queen with a softened
expression. Thirumalambal, he began, his voice gentle, I have
been foolish. I see now that I overreacted. I let my pride blind
me. I m so sorry. 

The queen, who had longed for this moment, smiled and replied,
 If you like, we can leave this quarrel behind us. I would very
much like to listen to your poem. 

Rama, who had orchestrated this settlement, felt victorious. The
king and the queen later presented him with valuable gifts for
his service. The royal couple s bond was restored, and the palace
brimmed once again with joy and laughter.

One bright Monday morning, I woke up to the sounds of birds chirping
loudly. For once, I wasn t late for school. My uniform was neatly laid out,
and my homework was already packed in my bag. I felt proud of myself
for being so organised. But little did I know, the day would still teach me
an important lesson.

During the morning assembly, our teacher, Mrs. Rao, announced a
surprise Science quiz. My heart skipped a beat. I had studied the chapter
a week ago, but I had forgotten to revise it over the weekend. As I sat at
my desk with the question paper in front of me, I froze. The questions
looked familiar, yet I couldn t recall the answers clearly. I tried my best
to focus, but it wasn t enough. Later, when the results were announced,
I scored much lower than I expected. Disappointed, I spoke to Mrs. Rao
after the class. She smiled and said, It s not about how much you know
but how consistently you prepare. Small efforts add up every day. 

Her words stayed with me. From that day on, I made ita habit to revise my
lessons regularly, even if there wasn t an immediate test. Responsibility
isn t just about being on time or finishing tasks it s about being ready
for what s unexpected.

Sharp contrasts of all colours here are seen; ra
 The light-green graceful tamarinds abound / on
Amid the mango clumps of green profound, of

And palms arise, like pillars gray, between;
And o er the quiet pools the seemuls lean,
Red red, and startling like a trumpet s sound.
But nothing can be lovelier than the ranges
Of bamboos to the eastward, when the moon
Looks through their gaps, and the white lotus changes
Into a cup of silver. One might swoon
Drunken with beauty then, or gaze and gaze
On a primeval Eden, in amaze.

: Inoticed small droplets of blood along the track,

These small specks told me of an animal lacking
such defence, hence the short tail.

: (Impressed) You reasoned with great insight,

showing both observation and deduction. (Turning
to Dev Datt) And you, what did you observe that set
you apart from your companions?

: I noticed, Your Majesty, that the prints of the

camel s forefeet were deep and clear, while those
of the sound hind foot were faint. This indicated
that the camel was drawing up its hind legs, likely
due to discomfort. It moved cautiously, burdened
by a pain in its belly, trying to spare itself further
suffering with every step.

: (Marvelling) Extraordinary! You have not seen the

camel, yet you know it intimately. Your reasoning
is flawless and speaks of wisdom that goes
beyond mere sight. (Turning to the Merchant) Your
accusations are baseless and misguided. These are
men of wisdom, not thieves. Go, and continue your
search for your camel, and be mindful of whom
you accuse in the future.

deeply and exits, his face red with shame.)

I You will listen to a woman narrating a story. As you listen, fill in the
blanks for the following sentences given below by selecting the
correct options.

Hello everybody! Today [ll be narrating a story about a
; quick-witted courtier in the kingdom of Vijayanagara.

- scholars in the court of King Krishnadeva Raya. The court scholars

~ did not want to accept the challenge as they were worried of
being defeated by the visitor. Besides this, they were also afraid
that the king would be angry if they refused to face the scholar.

A renowned scholar, proud of his abilities, once visited the
. K , kingdom of Vijayanagara. You see, he wanted to challenge the

They knew that only the quick-witted Tenali Rama would be
able to manage the situation. So, naturally, they asked him for
a solution. As expected, Rama told them that he would accept
the challenge.

The next day, Rama arrived at the palace. Rama and the
challenger sat facing each other. There was a bundle wrapped
in silk kept near Rama. He placed his hand on the bundle and
said to the visitor, Let us start by discussing the merits of
tila-kashta-mahisha-bandhana . The visitor was taken aback. He
had read thousands of works. But he had never heard of this
work. He had no idea what to say. The scholar had to accept his
defeat. Ashamed, he quietly left the palace.

Now, the king was curious to know about the great work Rama
had mentioned. Rama smiled and removed the silk cloth. There
was a huge bundle of sticks tied with a thick rope! The king was
puzzled and asked for an explanation.

Rama told him, O king! til is sesame; kashta is stick, tilakashta
means sticks of sesame plants . Then, displaying the rope Rama
said, This is the rope used to tie a buffalo mahisha means
buffalo, bandhana means the rope used for tying so, this is
tila-kashta-mahisha-bandhana. 

The king burst out laughing. The poor visitor had become scared
hearing such a difficult name. In this way, Rama had taught the
arrogant scholar a lesson.

I You will listen to a presentation about the wonderful Rock Garden
of Chandigarh. As you listen, answer the questions in one to three
exact words.

Hello everyone! The Rock Garden is a spacious open-air
exhibition. It is a proof of human creativity with waste materials.

This garden was created by Nek Chand, in 1957. This is the _
reason the garden is also known as Nek Chand s Rock Garden. J ~"
The garden was featured on an Indian postage stamp in 1983 4 \
and Nek Chand was awarded the Padma Shri a year later.

The Rock Garden is spread across a massive 40-acre wonderland.
Do you know why I say this? Well, it is because it has several
colourful sculptures and mosaic of art pieces.

What is unique about the Rock Garden is that it is divided into
three distinct phases. Each area reveals a unique collection
of installations including terracotta pots, light fixtures, and
even broken toilet pots, that have been transformed into
extraordinary masterpieces.

You will be surprised to know that the borders of the Rock Garden

are lined with around 5,000 statues. The Rock Garden is truly a Vly
place that celebrates the best from waste. I sincerely recommend - that you visit this extraordinary national treasure.

I You will listen to four people sharing their thoughts on why they enjoy
witty characters in stories. As you listen, match statements 1-6 given
below to the speakers (i)-(iv). There are two statements you do not need.

SPEAKER (i)

SPEAKER (il) :

SPEAKER (ili):

SPEAKER (iv) :

: Tlove witty characters because they make serious

situations funny! Even when things seem tense,
they always havea clever response. Such characters
never panic, think fast, and solve problems in the
smartest way. I wish I could think that quickly!

Witty characters are the best because they make
stories exciting. I especially like how they turn
ordinary moments into something memorable. It
makes me feel like intelligence and humour are
just as powerful as strength.

I enjoy witty characters because they always
have an answer for everything! They use humour
instead of fighting, and that s really wonderful.
Even in folktales, they prove that smart thinking
can win over force. It makes me laugh but also
teaches me to stay calm in tricky situations.

Witty characters add charm to a story. Their
intelligence keeps the reader engaged, and
their humour makes learning fun. Whether it s
a folktale or a modern one, a clever character
always stands out. I often feel that wit and wisdom
go hand-in-hand!
