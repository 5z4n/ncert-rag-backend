The human eye can only see objects that are above a certain
size. For a long time, many tiny things around us remained
unknown. Long ago, people discovered that a curved piece of
glass could make small things look bigger. The piece of glass
was shaped like a lentil seed thick in the middle and thin at
the edge hence they called it a lens. Over time, lenses were
improved to become more powerful. Each new tool, from simple
magnifying glasses to microscopes, helped humans see what
their eyes could not. The invention of the microscope opened
a fascinating hidden world filled with tiny living creatures. We
will explore some of these life forms in this chapter.

You have already learnt about the amazing variety of living
beings. Just look around there are so many beautiful plants
and animals! They are of all shapes, sizes, and colours. Some
living beings are tiny, while others are really big. They differ not
only in their structure but also in many other features. All these
living beings, whether plants or animals, are called organisms.
Have you ever noticed the smallest organism around you that is
visible to the naked eye? Think about it how small a thing can
your eyes actually see?

You might have seen some people using reading glasses. How
does it help them see better? Or what happens when we use a
magnifying glass to observe something?

| Activity 2.1: Let us observe

e Take a round-bottom flask made up of glass as shown in
Fig. 2.1. Fill it with water.

e Close the mouth of the flask with a cork.

e Now, place the flask on an open book and look at
the letters through it.

Do you notice something interesting? The letters
appear larger when seen through the flask! This
happens because the flask filled with water acts like a
magnifying glass. Now, use a real magnifying glass to
look at small organisms, like an ant. Were you able to
see the details of its body more clearly?

For a long time, people were curious to explore the
tiny organisms around them, but they could not see them
with their naked eyes. So, how did we finally discover
this invisible world? Do you know which scientific

discovery helped us see the tiny world for the first time? Fig. 2.1: Round-bottom flask

Ever heard of ...

In 1665, a scientist named Robert Hooke
published a book called Micrographia. He
was a careful observer, and a skilled artist.
In this book, he showed detailed drawings
of tiny things that people had never seen
before things he saw using a tool we now
call a microscope.

His microscope made things look 200
to 300 times bigger, than what one could
see with the unaided eye. One day, he
looked at a thin slice of cork and saw it
was made of many small, empty spaces.
These compartments reminded him of a
honeycomb. He drew what he saw and
called each small space a cell. This was the
first time the word cell was used in science
to describe the basic unit of life.

Around the same time in 1660s, Antonie
van Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch scientist, made
better lenses that allowed him to build more
useful microscopes. He was the first person
to clearly see and describe tiny living things
like bacteria and blood cells. Because of this,
he is known as the Father of Microbiology.

2.1 What Is a Cell?

All living beings are made up of cells. You might wonder what
cells actually look like. Let us take a closer look at the basic
structure of a cell using a microscope.

e Take an onion bulb from your kitchen or garden and wash it

thoroughly with water.

e Cut the onion bulb vertically into pieces.
e Take one piece of onion and pull out the thin, transparent
layer from its inner surface with the help of forceps. This

layer is called the onion peel.

Activity 2.2: Let us study a cell
(Teacher demonstration activity)

e Place the peel in a petri dish containing a few drops of / 8- 2.3: (@) Removing

safranin (red-coloured stain) for 30 seconds. This will give

onion peel from an

a pinkish colour to the cells and help us see them clearly.
e With the help of thin brush transfer the onion peel to another

petri dish containing water to rinse
the peel and remove extra stain.

e Now, carefully place the stained
onion peel on the glass slide using
a thin brush, ensuring it does not
break or fold.

e Put a drop of glycerin over the
onion peel on the slide. The
glycerin will prevent drying of the
cells and improve clarity for better
visualisation of cells.

e Slowly place a coverslip over the
peel using a needle, such that no
air bubbles get trapped.

e Use blotting paper to gently wipe
off any extra glycerin around the
edges of the coverslip.

e View the slide under a microscope
or a foldscope. Compare it with
Fig. 2.3c.

e What similarities do you find in
Fig. 2.3c and Fig. 2.3d?

You will observe nearly rectangular
structures under the microscope. These
are the cells of the onion peel, which
are closely arranged without any space
between them. Try to observe the peels
of the leaves of different plants around
you. You will find that all plants are
made up of cells. What do you think
the body of an animal is made of?

Activity 2.3: Let us investigate

e Rinse your mouth with clean water.

e Use the blunt end of a clean toothpick, and gently scrape the
inside of your cheek.

e Place the scraped material in a drop of water on a clean glass
slide and spread it evenly.

e Add a drop of methylene blue (a blue-coloured stain) over
the material on slide. Adding stain improves the visibility of
the material under the microscope by increasing contrast.

e After one minute, add a drop of glycerin over the material on
the slide to prevent the cells from drying.

e Now, carefully place a clean coverslip on the material, and
remove the excess glycerin from the edges of the coverslip
using blotting paper.

e Observe the slide under a microscope and draw what you
see in your notebook.

What did you observe? You will observe a polygon
shaped structure as shown in Fig. 2.4. These are cheek
cells, which form the inner lining of your mouth.

Cytoplasm fo) What similarities and differences did you observe

between the cells of onion peel in Activity 2.2 and

2) human cheek cells in Activity 2.3?

Nucleus Laie) You have observed that cells have three main parts
<E a thin outer lining, a central region, and a small
Fig. 2.4: Mount of human cheek cells _YOund structure inside it. The outer layer is called the
cell membrane. The round structure in the middle is
the nucleus, which is also covered by a thin membrane. The space
between the cell membrane and nucleus is filled with cytoplasm.
These three cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus are the
basic parts of a cell. Some cells, like onion peel cells, have an
extra outer layer called the cell wall. What is the importance of
these structures in a cell? What functions do they perform? Are

these functions important for the maintenance of life?

The cell membrane encloses the cytoplasm and nucleus. The
cell membrane separates one cell from another. It is porous and
allows the entry of materials essential for life processes and the
exit of waste material.

Cytoplasm contains other components of the cell and
compounds, such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and mineral
salts. Most of the life processes take place within the cytoplasm.

Chapter 2.indd 12 6/30/2025 4:19:39 PM

Cell membrane
ne Co 2 The Invisible Living World: Beyond Our Naked ne] 1

The nucleus regulates all activities that occur within the cell.
It also regulates growth.

The cell wall in the plant cell provides rigidity and strength
to plants. This is why all cells are arranged compactly with each
other and look firm in structure.

A step further

Cells in all parts of a plant have tiny rod-shaped structures called
plastids. Some plastids, like chloroplasts, contain chlorophyll, which
makes them green and helps in photosynthesis. In non-green parts,
they help in the storage of substances. Plant cells also have a large,
empty-looking space called a vacuole. This helps the plant cell store
important substances, get rid of waste, and maintain the shape of
the cell. This gives strength and support to the plant. In animal cells,
vacuoles are usually not present, if present, they are usually small.
These small vacuoles store certain substances dissolved in water
(Fig. 2.5). So, a cell is not just a simple bag of liquid it is a complex
structure made up of many different parts, each with its own special
function to allow the cell, and in turn the entire organism to work.

We have now understood the basic structure of cell. And we
now also understand that plant and animal cells differ in shape and
structure.

Do different animal cells also vary in their shape and structure?

2.1.1 Variation in shape and structure of cells (a) Muscle cell

The muscle cell and the nerve cell of ahuman are shown in Fig. 2.6a
and (b). What are the similarities and differences you see in them?
A muscle cell (Fig. 2.6a) is shaped like a spindle, while a nerve
cell (Fig. 2.6b) is very long and has branches. Similarly, some cells
are round in shape, while others are long and thin. The number
of cells also varies in different organisms. Why do cells look so (b) Nerve cell

The unique shape, size, and structure of cells help them
carry out their specific functions. But how do these cells help in
performing various functions in the body? Let us find out.

You observed in Activity 2.3 that inner cheek cells are thin
and flat. They form a protective lining on the inner surface of the
cheek. Nerve cells also known as neurons carry messages in our
body. The elongated shape and branched structure help them
reach different parts of the body and pass on messages quickly.
Similarly, plant cells also show variation. In plants, too, cells may
be rectangular, elongated, oval, or even tube-like. Some plant
cells form long tubes that help carry water throughout the plant.

You have already studied the digestive system in Grade 7. Different
parts of the digestive system are made up of different types of cells.
A group of muscle cells are present in the food pipe. These cells
contract and relax in a wave-like manner, pushing the food down
to the stomach. This movement is possible because muscle cells are
thin, flexible, and spindle-shaped. The stomach also has different
types of cells for performing different functions. Muscle cells in the
stomach wall help churn the food. Other cells in the inner lining of
the stomach produce digestive juices and acid that help break down
the food. All these cells work together to make digestion possible.

2.2 What Are the Levels of Organisation in

the Body of a Living Organism?

The body of a living organism is organised in a complex way. Cell
(Fig. 2.7a), isthe basic unit of life, just like a brick is the basic unit of wall
(Fig. 2.3d). A group of similar cells forms a type of tissue (Fig. 2.7b).
Different tissues are organised to form an organ (Fig. 2.7c). Several
organs work together to form an organ system that performs a
major function of the body (Fig. 2.7d). All the organ systems together
make up acomplete organism (Fig. 2.7e) like a plant or an animal.
So, the levels of organisations are:
Cell > Tissue > Organ Organ system Organism

These levels of organisation help us understand how simple
building blocks like cells come together to form a complex
living being.

The life of complex living organisms begins with a single cell 
 ego . The egg of any organism has an amazing ability to divide
repeatedly to form a complete living being made up of many cells.
Such living beings are called multicellular organisms. Animals,
including humans, and plants are all examples of multicellular
organisms.

Ever heard of ...

_ The yolk (the yellow part of an egg) of an
ostrich egg is a single cell the largest
known cell in the living a
world measuring about 130
mm to 170 mm in diameter. The
egg contains extra non-cellular
material: a shell for protection and a white liquid that
nourishes the cell during its continued development.

2.3 What Are Microorganisms?

Some living organisms are made up of just one or very few cells.
They are so small that they can not be seen with the naked eye.
These are called microorganisms. Some microorganisms, like
bacteria and Amoeba, are made of just one cell (unicellular). Others,
like some fungi and algae, have many cells (multicellular). They
are found all around us in water, soil, air, and even inside our
body! But what do their cells look like? Are they like the plant and
animal cells we just learnt about, or are they different? To observe
the cells of a microorganism, again, we need to use a microscope
which magnifies their size and makes them visible to us. Scientists
have also created a low-cost and foldable paper microscope or
foldscope. Foldscopes may not provide the same level of details
like high-powered laboratory microscopes. However, these make
microscopic world accessible to many people.

Let us now take a closer look at the fascinating world of microbes.

Activity 2.4: Let us observe pond water/
stagnant water

e Take a container and collect pond or stagnant water in it
with the help of your teacher or elder(s).

e Use a dropper and place a drop of pond or stagnant water on
a microscope or foldscope slide. Put a coverslip and observe
it under the microscope or foldscope.

e Observe the tiny organisms found in the pond or stagnant
water.

Activity 2.5: Let us observe soil suspension

e Take a beaker and collect some moist soil in it from the
nearby field or garden. Do not touch the soil with your bare
hands use a spoon or gloves.

6/30/2025 4:19:42 PM

e Pour some water into the beaker and stir it with a glass rod.
The liquid, which may look dirty, has very fine particles of
soil, and is called soil suspension. Keep it aside for some time
and let the mixture settle.

e Use a dropper and take a drop of water from the top layer.
Place the drop on a microscope slide.

e Cover it gently with a coverslip and observe it under the
microscope (Fig. 2.8).

You may observe small moving organisms similar to those you saw
in Activity 2.4. This indicates that even soil suspension contains a
variety of tiny creatures that cannot be seen with the unaided eye.
The tiny creatures that cannot be seen with the naked eye are called
microorganisms (micro means very small; organisms means living
beings) or microbes.

| Activity 2.6: Let us study

Fig. 2.8: Observation A Sroup of students studying in Grade 8 performed Activities 2.4
of soilsuspension and 2.5. They also collected information from the library and
under the microscope internet. They recorded the data obtained after observing pond
water in Table 2.1 and the data obtained after observing soil
suspension in Table 2.2. They identified the microorganisms as
protozoa, algae, fungi, and bacteria. You can record if you find

any of these categories of organisms.

Did you also observe any of these microorganisms or
something different? Record in your notebook and discuss in
your class. In Tables 2.1 and 2.2, you have identified a variety
of microorganisms. They are everywhere, and we can only see
them with a microscope a device that magnifies them 100 to
400 times. Though microorganisms are small in size, they play an
important role in our lives.

Ever heard of ...

Viruses are microscopic and acellular. Viruses
multiply when they enter a living cell. They may
infect plants, animals, or bacterial cells and may
cause a disease.

Chapter 2.indd 17 6/30/2025 4:19:44 PM

2.4 How Are We Connected to Microbes?

Can we find microorganisms in other places, too?
Let us have a discussion:
Have you ever seen a lemon, tomato, orange, or any
other food item rot after being left outside for some
time? If yes, you may have noticed a powdery or
cotton-like growth on them (Fig. 2.9). This happens
because they have been infected by microbes. But
Fig. 2.9: Fruit with microorganism where did these microbes come from? How did they
growing on it come in contact with the food?
This happens because microorganisms can be _ found
everywhere, be it in water, soil, air, or even in some food items.

You can use a foldscope
or a microscope to explore
surfaces of leaves, stems,
roots, or any other part to
see them. Like plants and
animals, microorganisms
also show great diversity.
Some of them can even be
found in extreme climatic
conditions, such as hot
water springs and snow
cold zones as well as at moderate temperatures. You already know
some of these organisms live inside our bodies, especially in our
gut! You have studied in the chapter Life Processes in Animals in
Curiosity, Grade 7 that our intestine has many bacteria that help in
digestion. Like plants and animals, microorganisms vary in shape,
size, and structure. In Tables 2.1 and 2.2, you would have observed
microorganisms of different shapes spherical, rod-shape, or
irregular.

How does the diversity of microorganisms play a role in our
daily life? How do they help clean the environment?

But why do microorganisms
not infect the pickles and
murabbas?

This is because you add many spices
with salt or sugar to it which act as
preservatives. High concentration
of salt or sugar do not allow these
organisms to grow on them.

2.4.1 Key players in cleaning the environment
Let us attempt to understand this by doing an activity.

| Activity 2.7: Let us do

e Take an empty container and fill it halfway with garden soil.
e Add some fruit and vegetable peels to the container.
Thereafter, put a layer of soil on it and leave it aside.
Curiosity Textbook of Science for Grade a a a

ne Co 2 The Invisible Living World: Beyond Our Naked ae] 1

e After 2-3 weeks, observe the changes
that have taken place.

e Do you observe any difference in the
contents of the container?

You may find that peels of fruits and
vegetables have turned into a dark-coloured
material. This is manure, which is rich in
nutrients and helps increase the fertility of
the soil. But how did the peels of fruits and
vegetables turn into manure?

In Activity 2.6, you saw that soil contains

various kinds of microorganisms. Some of Fig. 2.10: Recycling of nutrients by making

these microorganisms, like fungi and bacteria, manure
act on the plant waste and slowly break it down into simpler,
nutrient-rich manure. You may have seen gardeners in your
school or in a field near your house collecting dry leaves and

plant waste and putting them into pits. Do you now understand

why they do this? It is to make natural manure.

Our scientific heritage

Ancient Indian texts, particularly the Vedas, have references of
the word Krim? which means different tiny entities including

mention their beneficial and harmful effects.
Atharvaveda also refers to Krim? .

If you look around carefully, you might see decaying plants
and fallen leaves stored in a container or lying in the garden,
disappear after some time from the surroundings. This is
because microorganisms breakdown and turn them into simpler
substances rich in nutrients. These nutrients go back to the soil
and help plants grow better. Microorganisms also decompose
bodies of dead animals. So, microbes help recycle the waste and
return important nutrients to nature. Manure formation occurs
at optimal temperature and appropriate moisture level.

Isn t it interesting? By now, you must have understood that
bacteria and some fungi are types of microorganisms that play
an important role in our lives. And guess what, these helpful
bacteria can also decompose animal wastes like dung!

From Activity 2.7, we can also infer that microorganisms not
only help in plant growth, but also clean our environment by
breaking down waste.

6/30/2025 4:19:46 PM

Now, think what would have happened if microorganisms did
not exist on Earth?

A step further

Microbes as a source of biogas

Many microorganisms, like bacteria and fungi, live in an oxygenfree environment. Some of these bacteria have the ability to
decompose plant and animal waste present in the environment or
household wastewater. During the process, they release a mixture
of gases containing carbon dioxide, and a high proportion of
another gas, methane. This gas has been used as a fuel source for
cooking, heating, generating electricity, and to even run vehicles.

Dr. Ananda Mohan Chakrabarty (1938-2020) was a
scientist who studied bacteria. In 1971, he developed
a special bacterium that could break down oil spills,
helping to clean the environment. His discovery
received a patent in 1980. Patent is a copyright
given to a person so that no one else can copy, use
or sell his/her invention without permission. His
work showed how microorganisms could be used
to solve environmental problems like pollution. He
is remembered for his contributions to science and for protecting the
environment using microbes. What are the other problems which you

How does the diversity of microorganisms help in our kitchen?
2.4.2 Microorganisms and food
Let us try to understand by performing activities in the kitchen.

| Activity 2.8: Let us perform

e Take two bowls A and B.
e In each, take 200 g of flour (atta or maida) and add a pinch

e Cover the dough with a damp cloth and keep it in a warm place.
e Observe both the bowls after 4-5 hours.

Did you find any change in the volume, smell, or texture of the
dough? If not, leave the dough for some more time. After some time,
you may notice that the dough in bowl A, where yeast was added, has
risen slightly, become fluffy, and has a different smell compared to
the dough kneaded without yeast. Why does this happen? What is the
role of yeast? Why did we add sugar and warm water to the flour?

Yeast is a type of microorganism. It belongs to a group
of microorganisms, called fungi. Yeast grows well in warm
conditions. You may recall from chapter Life Process in Animals 
in Grade 7 that, like other organisms, yeast also respires and breaks
down food to release energy for their growth and carry out life
processes. During this process, carbon dioxide is released, which
forms bubbles that makes the dough soft and fluffy. Yeast also
produces a small amount of alcohol during this process, which
gives the dough a slightly different smell. This special property of
yeast is used in the process of making breads, cakes, and more!
In addition to yeast, some bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, help in
fermentation of batter for making idli and dosa, and dough for
making bhatura.

| Activity 2.9: Let us prepare

e Take two small glass bowls label them A and B .
e Pour lukewarm milk in bowl A, and cold milk in bow] B.

using a spoon.

e Cover both bowls. Keep bowl Aina warm place and bow1 B in
a cool place (like a refrigerator) for a few hours or overnight.

e Observethe changes inthe glass bowls. Write your predictions
and observations in Table 2.4.

Chapter 2.indd 21 6/30/2025 4:19:48 PM

You will observe that in bowl
A, the milk has turned into curd
after a few hours and has become
little sour. Whereas in bow! B, the
milk has not curdled, but it might
be a little sour. Do you know why
this happens? The curd contains
several types of bacteria. One
of them is Lactobacillus. This
bacterium feeds on the sugar in
the milk (lactose), multiplies, and
ferments the milk to form curd.
Instead of producing alcohol (like
Fig. 2.12: Root nodules of Cowpea yeast), these bacteria produce

plant which contain Rhizobium _ lactic acid, which makes curd
sour. These bacteria grow well in warm conditions. That is why
curd is formed in bowl A but not in bow] B.

We can categorise the microorganisms into different
categories, such as protozoa, fungi, bacteria, some algae, and
more. Some bacteria, such as Rhizobium, form the swollen
regions called nodules and live in them as shown in Fig. 2.12.
Roots of certain legumes, such as beans, peas, and lentils have
root nodules that contain Rhizobium bacteria. These bacteria
trap nitrogen from the air and make it useful for the plants.
This helps plants grow better without chemical fertilisers.
That is why farmers grow legumes in rotation with other crops.
This naturally increases the nitrogen in the soil and keeps it
healthy for the next crop.

2.4.3 Amazing microalgae: tiny helpers in water

Microalgae are microscopic plant-like organisms that live in
water, soil, air, and even on trees. They make their own food using
sunlight. While doing this, they also release oxygen and produce
more than half of the Earth s oxygen supply. They are rich in
nutrients and serve as a food source for many aquatic animals.
Some, like Spirulina, Chlorella, and Diatoms, are also used by
humans as health supplements and medicines. Microalgae also
help in cleaning water and are used to make biofuel.

However, pollution, climate change, and habitat destruction are
threatening microalgal diversity and abundance. It is important
to conserve these tiny organisms to protect the environment and
maintain oxygen balance on Earth.

2.5 Why Is Cell Considered to Be a Basic Unit

of Life?

The body of all living organisms are made up of tiny building

blocks called cells. A single cell contains various components

that help organisms perform various functions. The bodies of all

plants and animals are made up of many cells. Therefore, they are

called multicellular (many-celled) organisms. In multicellular

organisms, cells carry out specialised functions individually but

also cooperate with each other to increase the chance of survival.
Some microorganisms, such as bacteria

and protozoa, are made up of just one cell.

These are called unicellular (single-celled)

organisms. They carry out all the functions

necessary for their survival in a single cell. A

Like animal and plant cells, the cells of microorganisms are
also surrounded by a cell membrane. Cells of fungi additionally
have a cell wall, but they do not have chloroplasts, so they cannot
make their own food through photosynthesis. Bacteria do not
have a well-defined nucleus and a nuclear membrane. Instead
they have a nucleoid. This feature distinguishes them from cells
of yeast, protozoa, algae, fungi, plants, and animals.

We have only looked at a few basic cell structures here. The cell
has other components about which you will learn in higher classes.
For observing subcellular components, we need microscopes
with high magnification. An electron microscope magnifies the
cell about 10,00,000 times, where we can see more structures
present in a cell.

By now, you must have understood that all living beings,
including microorganisms, are made up of one or more cells.
Their cells differ in size, shape, and structure. Plant and animal
cells also have some differences. Understanding these differences
helps us learn how these organisms function differently.

In this chapter, we have learnt about the beneficial
microorganisms. However, there are some microbes that cause
diseases in plants and animals including humans. We will learn
about some of the diseases caused by microbes in the next chapter.

Snapshots

Microorganisms are small-sized organisms and are not visible to the

unaided eye.

They can live in all kinds of environments, and even in the bodies of

plants and animals.

They are either unicellular or multicellular. Bacteria and protozoans

are unicellular; fungi can be unicellular or multicellular, while plants

and animals are multicellular.

@ The cell is a basic unit of life.

 The body of all living organisms is made up of cells. A cell contains
various components which help the organisms perform their functions
and survive.

@ Atypical cell is bounded by a cell membrane, filled with cytoplasm
and contains a nucleus. Plant, fungal, and bacterial cells have an extra
covering, called a cell wall, around the cell membrane. Bacteria lack a
well-defined nucleus.

@ Cells differ in shape and size. Their shape is related to the function
performed by them.

 Bacteria, fungi, and protozoa are different kinds of microorganisms.

 Viruses are also small in size, but they are different from other
microorganisms since they reproduce only inside the host organism.

Microorganisms can be beneficial or harmful to us.

Some microorganisms decompose the plant and animal waste into
simple substances and clean up the environment.

Some microorganisms reside in the root nodules of legumes, such as
peas, beans, and lentils. They trap nitrogen from the air and increase
the soil fertility.

 Yeasts are fungi which are used in the process of making breads, cakes,
pastries, idlis, dosas, and bhaturas.

 Lactobacillus is used in the curd formation at home and fermentation
process in food industry.

(i) What do you predict will happen after 3-4 days? She
observed that the balloon attached to testtube B was
inflated. What can be a possible explanation for this?
(a) Water evaporated in test tube B and filled the
balloon with the water vapour.

(b) The warm atmosphere expanded the air inside the
test tube B, which inflated the balloon.

(c) Yeast produced a gas inside the test tube B which Fig. 2.14: Experimental

(d) Sugar reacted with warm air, which produced gas,
eventually inflating the balloon.

(ii) She took another test tube, 1/4 filled with lime water.

She removed the balloon from test tube B in such a

manner that the gas inside the balloon did not escape.

She attached the balloon to the test tube with lime

water and shook it well. What do you think she wants to

. A farmer was planting wheat crops in his field. He added

nitrogen-rich fertiliser to the soil to get a good yield of crops.
In the neighbouring field, another farmer was growing bean
crops, but she preferred not to add nitrogen fertiliser to get
healthy crops. Can you think of the reasons?

. Snehal dug two pits, A and B, in her garden. In pit A, she

put fruit and vegetable peels and mixed it with dried leaves.
In pit B, she dumped the same kind of waste without mixing
it with dried leaves. She covered both the pits with soil and
observed after 3 weeks. What is she trying to test?

. Identify the following microorganisms:

(i) I live in every kind of environment, and inside your gut.
(ii) I make bread and cakes soft and fluffy.
(iii) I live in the roots of pulse crops and provide nutrients
for their growth.

. Devise an experiment to test that microorganisms need

optimal temperature, air, and moisture for their growth.

. Take 2 slices of bread. Place one slice in a plate near the

sink. Place the other slice in the refrigerator. Compare after
three days. Note your observations. Give reasons for your
observations.

e India has a long history of biogas production. One of our
oldest biogas plant was set up in late 1850s. Find out about
the Biogas Program initiated by the Ministry of New and /
Renewable Energy, Government of India.

e Fermented food items like fermented soybeans and
fermented bamboo shoots are consumed as traditional food
in some parts of India. With the help of your parents and
teachers, list some traditional food items from your area
that utilise the process of fermentation. Investigate the
ingredients used in the preparation of these fermented food
items; the method of preparing them; the microorganism
responsible for the fermentation of the food, and the cultural
and nutritional importance of the fermented food.

e Study the different parts of a macro fungus mushroom
using a magnifying glass and microscope/foldscope. Take
the help of students from senior classes and explore the
internal structure of different parts of mushrooms under the
microscope/foldscope in your school laboratory.

e Interact with an entrepreneur and learn the steps for
cultivation of mushroom.
