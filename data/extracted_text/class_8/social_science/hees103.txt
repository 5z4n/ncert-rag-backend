The Rise of the Marathas

Among the merchants, the hat-wearers like the Portuguese, the
English, the Dutch, the French and the Danes also conduct trade.
But they are not like other merchants.... They are fully intent on
entering this land, increasing their territory and propagating their
religion. They are obstinate people, and Navy and gunpowder are
their chief weapons. Their traffic should be controlled, and they
shouldn t be allowed to build strong buildings.

Amidst such political changes, the cultural traditions continued,
particularly those related to bhakti (devotion to the divine or
a particular deity). Between the 7" and the 17" centuries, for
spiritual upliftment, saints and seekers from several parts of
India preferred the path of bhakti to merely external ritualism.
These saints, coming from diverse sections of society, composed
devotional songs and poetry in the languages of the masses,
which allowed their messages to travel far and wide.

In Maharashtra, many saints like Dnyaneshwar, Namdev,
Tukaram, Ramdas, etc., gained popularity at this time. They
helped translate important texts like the Upanishads and the
Bhagavad Gita into Marathi, making their philosophy accessible
to the people. Some also focused on social organisation and
political awareness, similar to the Sikh gurus. As a result, the
society acquired a solid cultural foundation, which later helped
the Marathas to organise themselves into a political power.

By the 17" century, some Maratha chiefs made early attempts at
establishing sovereignty, but they proved unsuccessful until
Shivaji rose to power and brought the Marathas together. But
who was Shivaji?

FOUNDATION OF MARATHA POWER AND THE
RISE OF SHIVAJI

In 1630, Shivaji was born in
the Bhonsle clan to Shahji and
Jijabai. At the time, Shahji
served the Deccan sultanates
and was often away from his
family. Meanwhile, in his jagir
at Pune, Shivaji grew up under
the watchful eyes of Jijabai and
some trusted officials, receiving
values and a good education.
At this time, the Pune region
was deeply affected by constant
infighting between the Deccan
sultans whom the Marathas
served, which caused much Fig. 3.5. A painting of Shivaji made
hardshipforthecommonpeople. _ e 1680s (British Museum)

When he was just 16, Shivaji launched military campaigns,
first consolidating his hold over the Pune region by capturing
neglected and unoccupied forts and strengthening their
defences. His vision of a sovereign kingdom or Swarajya grew
over the years, extending to political, economic and cultural
aspects, which we will explore in this chapter.

Fig. 3.6. The Sindhudurg Fort near the Maharashtra-Goa border is one of the several naval

fortifications built by the Marathas.

Shivaji s kingdom soon expanded to India s west coast, and to
secure access to the resources of coastal regions, he felt the need
to establish a navy. This was a truly revolutionary step at the time.
By comparison, the Bijapur Sultanate (ruled by the Adil Shahi
dynasty), maintained merchant ships but did not possess a fulltime naval force which could protect the coast; even the Mughal
Empire s use of a navy was very limited. Thus, the Maratha Navy
was born, whose exploits became legendary.

To protect his people from powerful enemies, Shivaji had
recourse to the tactic of guerrilla warfare, which uses small groups
of people in a focused way, with speed, surprise, and knowledge
of the terrain to defeat bigger armies. His successes soon invited
the wrath of the Bijapur Sultanate, which sent the veteran general
Afzal Khan to confront him. Shivaji and his advisers managed to
convince Afzal Khan to meet him for a one-on-one meeting at the
foot of the Pratapgad fort amid thick forests. There, Shivaji killed
Afzal Khan, and the Marathas, hidden in the mountains, routed the
Khan s army with guerrilla attacks.

Soon afterwards, the Mughal nobleman Shaista Khan invaded
Shivaji s territories with a big army for three years. Finally, with
only a few soldiers, Shivaji raided Shaista Khan s camp at night.
The Khan barely escaped from the raid, losing a few fingers,
and promptly left Maharashtra. This daring raid resembles the
modern-day surgical strike.

As a retaliatory action for the three-year-long wave of attacks,
Shivaji sacked Surat, a wealthy port city of the Mughal Empire
(in present-day Gujarat). There, he obtained enormous treasure
worth almost one crore of rupees, an extremely large sum for
the time. However, he was careful not to attack religious places
and even spared the house of Mohandas Parekh, a charitable
man. He sacked Surat again after a few years. These events
became so famous that they appeared in the London Gazette,
an English newspaper of the time, which conveyed how Shivaji
wrote to all European diplomatic agents in Surat, demanding
 immediate presents of money , failing which he would return
and ruin that city .

The sacking of Surat was a great insult to the might and prestige
of the Mughal Empire. Therefore, Aurangzeb sent Jai Singh, a
distinguished Rajput general, to defeat Shivaji. Against him,
Shivaji had to concede defeat at Purandar Fort (near Pune)
and enter into a treaty. He had to give up a sizeable part of his
kingdom, and his son Sambhaji had to enter Mughal service.

Chapter 3.indd 67

Shivaji was persuaded by Jai Singh to visit the Mughal court
at Agra, where he was made to stand before Aurangzeb, and
a Mughal general whom he had defeated earlier. Incensed at
this insult, Shivaji stormed out of the court, following which
Aurangzeb put him under house arrest. To escape this, Shivaji
devised a strategy he started distributing gifts to holy men
and Mughal generals. The gifts often contained fruits and
sweets, packed in big baskets. The guards initially checked them,
but soon stopped doing so; expecting this, Shivaji and his son
Sambhaji hid themselves in the baskets and made their escape.
Aurangzeb could never capture Shivaji again.

(panel in Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Park, Mumbai)

A few years later, in 1674, Shivaji was coronated with full Vedic
rites at the strong mountain fortress of Raigad. His formal title
after the coronation was Shri Raja Shiva Chhatrapati , and like
some past rulers, he started his own era, the Rajyabhisheka
shaka.

After this, Shivaji embarked upon a conquest of the South,
also referred to as the dakshina-digvijaya, which included the
important and then ill-defended region of present-day northern
Tamil Nadu and parts of Karnataka (see map in Fig. 3.9). This
southern extension later gave the Marathas great strategic depth
against the Mughal invasion.

While in the South, Shivaji forbade the Dutch from trading
slaves. At the time, most Europeans were capturing and
selling Indians as slaves and encountered no opposition from

A fever claimed Shivaji s life when he was fifty. He was a master
strategist anda true visionary, and within his lifetime, his exploits
had become legendary across India and beyond. The Europeans
compared him with ancient generals like Alexander, and the
Bundela prince Chhatrasal was so inspired by Shivaji s struggle
against the Mughals that he managed to create an independent
kingdom of Bundelkhand (divided between present-day Uttar
Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh). The famous Hindi poet Bhushan
specifically came to Maharashtra to meet Shivaji and composed
poems in his praise, some of which remain famous to this day.

LET'S EXPLORE

Pick an event from Shivaji s life and, with your classmates,
stage it as a play.

THE MARATHAS AFTER SHIVAJI

Shivaji had two sons Sambhaji and Rajaram. After Shivaji s
death, Sambhaji became the Chhatrapati. The Marathas were
then the only obstacle to total Mughal control of the Deccan.
Aurangzeb invaded the Deccan and conquered the Bijapur (or
Adil Shahi) and Golconda (or Qutb Shahi) Sultanates. He then
captured Sambhaji and, after torturing him brutally, executed
him. After this, he captured Raigad, the Maratha capital.

After Sambhaji, Rajaram became the Chhatrapati and fled
to Gingee (in present-day Tamil Nadu). The Mughal-Maratha
conflict thus spread to south India. The Marathas staunchly
defended their fortresses and often had the upper hand over
the Mughals in battles and skirmishes. Aurangzeb was thus
unable to leave the Deccan and died without having succeeded
in subduing the Marathas, who emerged as a strong contender
to the Mughals. No longer on the defensive, the Marathas led by
Tarabai, Rajaram s queen, made large-scale inroads into Mughal
territories, eventually conquering large parts of India.

During this rapid expansion, the Marathas themselves underwent a structural transformation. The centralised state from
Shivaji s time gave way to a more decentralised structure,

still nominally centred around the
Chhatrapati, but with the chiefs
wielding more power. In particular,
the Peshwa (a Persian term for prime
minister ) wielded great influence,
even over the Chhatrapati himself.
In particular, Peshwa Bajirao I and
his son Nanasaheb Peshwa were
instrumental in the _ pan-Indian
expansion of the Marathas.

The Marathas brought large parts of
India (Fig. 3.11) under their control
and generally ruled them well. But
with the regional chiefs acquiring
more power and autonomy, this also
resulted in occasional indiscipline
and abuse, in stark contrast with
Shivaji s values. For instance, the
Marathas ten-year campaign in

Fig. 3.10. Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj
(Sambhaji s son, seated right and sporting

Bengal inflicted much cruelty and
devastation on the common people.

In their northward expansion, the
Marathas briefly controlled the areas of Lahore, Attock and
even Peshawar (in modern-day Pakistan). They fought with the
Afghans, and despite suffering a disastrous defeat at Panipat
in 1761, they quickly recovered during the time of Peshwa
Madhavrao I. Under the leadership of Mahadji Shinde (also
known as Mahadji Scindia), they went on to recapture Delhi
in 1771, which remained under their control till the British
captured it three decades later.

In the latter half of the 18" century, the chief rivals of the British
in India were the Marathas. Three Anglo-Maratha wars (as
they are called) were fought between 1775 and 1818. Owing
to the Marathas increased internal disunity and the superior
organisational and technological abilities of the British, they
succeeded in ending the Maratha power. In effect, the British
took India from the Marathas more than from the Mughals or
any other power.

MARATHA ADMINISTRATION

Civilian administration

Shivaji instituted a relatively centralised administration for his
kingdom. He abolished the hereditary posts (generally practised
under the Sultans or the Mughals) and land assignments and
paid a salary to every government official out of the state
treasury. Many officials were periodically transferred as well,
ensuring that they would not
have enough power to dictate
terms to the king.

Shivaji also gave pensions to
widows of soldiers who died in

battles, even offering military

Y THINK ABOUT IT

Shivaji issued strict instructions to his officials not to mistreat
the subjects or to forcefully grab even a blade of grass from
them. In one of the letters issued to his officials, Shivaji says:

 Wood from big trees like teak is required for the Navy. If needed,
secure permission for cutting the trees from the forest and then
proceed. Other trees like the mango and jackfruit are also useful,
but do not touch them. Because such trees take many years to
mature, and the people look after them like their children. If you
cut them, will their sorrow ever end? If you accomplish something
by oppressing others, it perishes soon, along with the oppressor.
There is harm in the absence of such trees as well. Therefore, do
not use force in any circumstances. 

Based on Shivaji s letter, what can you tell about his values asa

Shivaji also had an ashta pradhana mandala, or council of eight

The Marathas often levied taxes called chauth (25 per cent)
and sardeshmukhi (an additional 10 per cent to chauth) from
provinces that were not directly under them, including places in
the Deccan and north India. In return, the Marathas protected
those provinces and did not intervene in their internal
administration. The Mughals also approved of this arrangement
through various treaties, and over time, some of these provinces
became a part of the Maratha Empire.

In the 18" century, the Marathas often adopted the Mughal
style of coinage owing to its popularity, but added their
own cultural symbols to it. For instance, this rare Maratha
coin known as the Ganapati-Pantapradhan rupee , minted
in the early 19" century by the Patwardhans (generals
under the Peshwa), features inscriptions in two scripts 
Devanagari and Persian. One

Military administration

The Maratha armed forces were divided into three parts 
infantry, cavalry and navy. The cavalry was made up of two
types of soldiers the bargirs, whose horses and equipment
were paid for by the state, and the shiledars, whose horses and
equipment were paid for by the soldiers themselves. In the 18"
century, the Marathas also noticed the superiority of Europeanstyle disciplined troops and artillery, and they tried to raise and
recruit such troops. In particular, Mahadji Shinde had a large
European-style army.

Swords and lances were the preferred weapons of the Marathas
(Fig. 3.16). However, they also used guns in sizable numbers.
Rockets were used in military campaigns from the days of
Shivaji himself, and by 1770, metal tube rockets were also
being used.

Chapter 3.indd 75

As we saw earlier, forts were
initially the mainstay of Maratha
power. Shivaji controlled and built
a considerable number of forts, as
they were essential to strategically
control important routes and
shelter the army when engaging in
guerrilla warfare.

finance minister of Shivaji, in his
work Adnyapatra ( The Royal Edict )

all the former kings secured the country by building

Maritime supremacy

As we saw, Shivaji created a navy to secure the west coast. In
the 18" century, Kanhoji Angre guided the Marathas to victory
in many naval battles, thanks to a clever use of geography and
battle tactics, despite the Maratha ships not being as technologically advanced as the European ones.

At the time, the main strength of Europeans in India was their
navies. They forced Indians to purchase their naval trade
passes (cartaz in Portuguese) at a price; any ship without a
pass was confiscated. The Marathas challenged this practice
and started demanding passes from the Europeans themselves
 who showed their frustration by labelling Kanhoji Angre
a pirate !

the men onboard. He also prepared a few ships to attack
Shivaji s coastal possessions. But, on hearing that Shivaji s
Navy contained more than a hundred ships, he retreated
inside the harbour with his ships.

Judicial system

The Marathas had an efficient judicial system, remarkable
for its moderation in using capital punishment (the death
penalty). The panchayat (not to be confused with the currentday Panchayat, a governmental body) was a local gathering of
officials and prominent men, and the main body that delivered
justice. An appeal could be made to a Maratha chief in case of
an unsatisfactory verdict. Additionally, in various prominent

Chapter 3.indd 77

towns such as Pune, Indore, etc., the kotwal or the police was
also deployed to ensure law and order within the city.

Trade networks

Shivaji encouraged trade and actively participated in maritime
foreign trade himself. He and his officials had their own ships,
which they regularly sent to ports as far away as Mocha in Yemen,
Muscat in Oman, and Malacca in Malaysia. Some of these ships
carried cargo like gold, textiles, etc.

Roads were constructed and maintained. In places such as
Odisha in the 18" century, a network of ferries was maintained
for riverine transport. Bridges were built over rivers and
small streams.

CULTURAL REVIVAL

The Marathas contributed substantially to India s
cultural developments. Shivaji s vision of Swarajya
is evident in his seal, which carried a Sanskrit
inscription, a notable departure from the prevalent
Persian seals This seal (i.e. authority) of Shivaji,
the son of Shahji, waxing like the new moon,
revered by the world, reigns for the welfare (of the

people). Fig. 3.18. Shivaji s seal

Shivaji also commissioned a treatise called Rdjya-VyavaharaKosha with the aim of promoting the Marathi language; it
provided Sanskrit equivalents for the prevalent Persian words
used in diplomatic exchanges, as a result of which, the percentage
of foreign loanwords in Maratha diplomacy decreased
considerably. Shivaji was a devout Hindu who respected other
religions while upholding his own. His saffron-coloured flag
was adopted by all Marathas. He rebuilt desecrated temples,
promoted Sanskrit and Marathi literature, religious institutions,
and traditional arts.

But perhaps he contributed most to the revival of ancient Indian
culture and values by giving people a demonstration that mighty
kingdoms and empires could be defeated, and the Marathas
could maintain, expand and administer an empire of their own.

Fig. 3.19. Tarabai in battle

Tarabai was a fearless Maratha
warrior queen who ruled in the early
18" century after the death of her
husband Rajaram. Realising that with
the presence of Aurangzeb and the
Mughal army in the Deccan, north
India was unprotected, she organised
large Maratha armies and sent them to
invade Mughal territories in the north.
In that sense, she was the architect of
the northward Maratha expansion.
Her sense of military strategy and
her tenacity outsmarted the Mughal
Empire and_ preserved Maratha
independence during a critical period.

Ahilyabai Holkar was a scion of the Holkar
dynasty, one of the chief families instrumental
for the Maratha expansion in north India;
during the 18" century, this dynasty ruled a
kingdom of considerable extentin central India,
around present-day Indore. Even after losing
her husband and son, she bravely governed
the state for thirty years, administering it
wisely while caring for the common people.
Ahilyabai was a devout person who built and
restored hundreds of temples, ghats, wells, and
roads throughout India, from Kedarnath in the
north to Rameswaram in the south.

Most famously, she rebuilt the Kashi Vishwanath temple in Varanasi that
had been destroyed by Aurangzeb and the Somnath temple in Gujarat
that had been destroyed by Mahmud of Ghazni. Ahilyabai Holkar is
also credited with promoting the Maheshwar weaving industry in
Madhya Pradesh, revitalising traditional handloom crafts that continue

to thrive today.

Have you heard of the dance form Bharatnatyam ? Did you
know that this dance form has a deep connection with the
Marathas? Can you find out what this connection was?

Of all the Thanjavur Maratha rulers, the contributions of
Serfoji II are the most notable. He was well-versed in many
Indian and European languages and wrote a Marathi play named
Devendra Kuravani, where he describes world geography in
detail as was known at the time. Serfoji patronised many talented
musicians, and it was during his time that modern Carnatic
music took shape, as did the early stages of the famous classical
dance form of Bharatanatyam.

Fig. 3.23. Marathi inscription on a wall of the Brihadishwara temple wall
recording the history of the Bhonsle family.

Serfoji was quite interested in medicine and established the
Dhanwantari Mahal, a centre of medicine that offered free
treatment of diseases using both Indian and Western medicine. He
also started a printing press, the first such example in India by a
native ruler. He got the history of the Bhonsle family inscribed on
the walls of the Brihadishwara temple at Thanjavur, which is one
of the largest single inscriptions in India, a record for posterity.

The cultural environment of Thanjavur was multilingual, with
a mix of many influences. The local Tamil culture, the Telugu
culture of the former rulers, and the current rulers Marathi
culture interacted with each other freely.

The Maratha legacy

The Maratha rule challenged Mughal dominance and
established the largest Indian empire before the British took
over the Subcontinent, controlling much of central and northern
India. They set up a new way of governing with an efficient
administration, and also revived the local Hindu traditions
without religious discrimination. Their brave fight against
oppressive rule and foreign power was driven by the fiery ideal
of Swarajya. Later it inspired many Indians to believe they
could govern themselves, planting the early seeds for India s
freedom movement.

or Tarabai) and write 3-4 paragraphs highlighting what
makes them inspirational. Include at least one challenge
they overcame.

If you could visit one Maratha fort today (such as Raigad,
Sindhudurg, Gingee, or Pratapgad), which would you
choose and why? Research its history, architecture, and
strategic importance. Present your findings as a digital
presentation or a poster in class.

chapter supports this idea?

Compare how Shivaji and later Marathas treated religious
places and people of different faiths. What evidence from
the chapter shows their approach to religious diversity?
