2.1 Experiencing the Power Play ...

An Impossible Venture!

Take a sheet of paper, as large a sheet as you can find. Fold it once. Fold
it again, and again.

(2) How many times can you fold it over and over?

Estu says I heard that a sheet of paper can t be folded more than
7 times .

Roxie replies What if we use a thinner paper, like a newspaper or a
tissue paper? 

Try it with different types of paper and see what happens.

What! That s crazy!
Just 46 times!? You

It might be hard to digest the fact that after just 46 folds, the thickness

is more than 7,00,000 km. This is the power of multiplicative growth,

also called exponential growth. Let us analyse the growth.

We have seen that the thickness doubles after every fold.

times (= 2 x 2 x 2). Check if that is true. Similarly,

from any point, the thickness after 10 folds increases by 1024 times
(= 2 multiplied by itself 10 times), as shown in the table below.

2.2 Exponential Notation and Operations

The initial thickness of the paper was 0.001 cm.

Upon folding once, its thickness became 0.001 cm x 2 = 0.002 cm.
Folding it twice, its thickness became 

0.001 cm x 2 x 2 = 0.004 cm, or 0.001 cm x 2? = 0.004 cm (in shorthand).
Upon folding it thrice, its thickness became 

0.001 cm x 2 x 2 x 2, or 0.001 cm x 2 = 0.008 cm.
When folded four times, its thickness became 

0.001 cm x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2, or 0.001 cm x 2* = 0.016 cm.
Similarly, the expression for the thickness of the paper when folded 7

times will be 0.001 cm x 2x 2x2 x2x2x2~x2,or0.001 cm x 2 =0.128 cm.
We have seen that square numbers can be expressed as n and cube

numbers as n .

nx n=n (read as n squared or n raised to the power 2 )

ae

 Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

nxnxn=n (read as n cubed or n raised to the power 3 )
nxnxnxn=n' (read as n raised to the power 4 or the 4th power of n )
nxnxnxnxnxnxn=M (read as n raised to the power 7 or the 7th
power of n ) and so on.

In general, we write n to denote n multiplied by itself a times.

54=5x5x5x5=625.

5* is the exponential form of 625. Here, 4 is the
exponent/power, and 5 is the base. Exponents of
the form 5" are called powers of 5: 5 , 5 , 5 , 54, etc.
2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2= 2" = 1024.
Remember the 1024 from earlier? There, it meant
that after every 10 folds, the thickness increased
1024 times.

5*is read as

 5 raised to the power 4 or
 5 to the power 4 or

Which expression describes the thickness of a sheet of paper after
it is folded 10 times? The initial thickness is represented by the
letter-number v.
(i) 10v (ii) 10 +v (iii) 2x 10xv
(iv) 2" (v) 2' v (vi) 10 v

Some more examples of exponential notation:
4x4x4=4 = 64,
(- 4) x (4) x (-4)=(- 4) =- 64.
Similarly,

axaxaxbxbcan be expressed as a*b (read as a cubed b squared).
axaxbxbxbxbcan be expressed as a b* (read as a squared b raised
to the power 4).
Remember that 4+4+4=3x4=12, whereas 4 x 4x 4 = 43 = 64.

The Stones that Shine ...

Three daughters with curious eyes,

Each got three baskets a kingly prize.

Each basket had three silver keys,

Each opens three big rooms with ease.

Each room had tables one, two, three,
With three bright necklaces on each, you see.
Each necklace had three diamonds so fine...
Can you count these stones that shine?

Hint: Find out the number of baskets and rooms.

The information given can be visualised as shown below.

From the diagram, the number of rooms is 3*. This can be computed
by repeatedly multiplying 3 by itself,
3x3=9.
9x 3 = 27.
27x 3=81.
81 x 3 = 243.

(?) How many diamonds were there in total? Can we find out by just one

multiplication using the products above?
The number of diamonds is 3 x 3x 3x3x3x3x3=3'.

 Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

We can write

37=(3x3x3x 3)x (3x 3x3)
We had computed till 3*. To find 3 , we can just multiply 3*(= 81) with

3 (= 27).
= 3*x 3 3x3x3x3x3x3x3
= 81 x 27 = 2187 34 33

Magical Pond

2 In the middle ofa beautiful, magical pond
lies a bright pink lotus. The number of
lotuses doubles every day in this pond.
After 30 days, the pond is completely
covered with lotuses. On which day was
the pond half full?

If the pond is completely covered by
lotuses on the 30th day, how much of it is
covered by lotuses on the 29th day?

Since the number of lotuses doubles every day, the pond should be
half covered on the 29th day.

(?) Write the number of lotuses (in exponential form) when the pond was 

(i) fully covered (ii) half covered

2 There is another pond in which the number of lotuses triples every day.
When both the ponds had no flowers, Damayanti placed a lotus in the
doubling pond. After 4 days, she took all the lotuses from there and put
them in the tripling pond. How many lotuses will be in the tripling pond
after 4 more days?

After the first 4 days, the number of lotuses is 1 x 2x 2x 2x 2 = 2%,
After the next 4 days, the number of lotuses is 2* x 3 x 3x 3x 3 = 2*x 3%,

(?) What if Damayanti had changed the order in which she placed the

flowers in the lakes? How many lotuses would be there?

1x 3*x 2*=(3x3x3x3)x(2x2x2>x 2).
(?) Can this product be expressed as an exponent m", where m and n are
some counting numbers?

How Many Combinations

2 Estu has 4dresses and 3 caps. How many different ways can Estucombine
the dresses and caps?

For each cap, he can choose any of the 4 dresses, so for 3 caps, 4 + 4 +
4 =4x 3 = 12 combinations are possible. We can also look at it as for
each dress, Estu can choose any of the 3 caps, so for 4 outfits, 3 +3+3+

3 = 3 x 4=12 combinations are possible.

(?) Roxie has 7 dresses, 2 hats, and 3 pairs of shoes. How many different
ways can Roxie dress up?

Hint: Try drawing a diagram like the one above.

2 Estu and Roxie came across a safe containing old stamps and coins |}
that their great-grandfather had collected. It was secured with a J)
5-digit password. Since nobody knew the password, they had no
option except to try every password until it opened. They were
unlucky and the lock only opened with the last password, after
they had tried all possible combinations. How many passwords
did they end up checking?

If you can t solve a problem, try to find a simpler version of the

Re problem that you can solve. This technique can come in handy
many times.

Instead of a 5-digit lock, let us assume we have a 2-digit lock and try
to find out how many passwords are possible.

There are 10 options for the first digit (0 to 9). For each of these, there
are 10 options for the second digit (If 0 is the first digit then 00, 01, 02,
03, ..., 09 are possible). Therefore the total number of combinations for
a 2-digit lock is 10 x 10 = 100.

Now, suppose we have a 3-digit lock. For each of the earlier 100
(2-digit) passwords there are 10 choices for the third digit. So, there are
100 x 10 = 1000 combinations for a 3-digit lock. You can list them all: 000,
001, 002, ....., 997, 997, 999.

PowerPlay ~~

How many 5-digit passwords are possible?

Each digit has 10 choices, so a
5-digit lock will have:

10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 = 10 
= 1,00,000 passwords. This is
the same as writing numbers
till 99,999 with all 5 digits, ie.,
00000, 00001, 00002, ...00010,
00011, ...,00100, 00101, ...,00999,
... 30456, ..., 99998, 99999.

Estu says, Next time, I will
buy a lock that has 6 slots with
the letters A to Z. I feel it is safer. 

(?) How many passwords are possible with such a lock?

2 Think about how many combinations are possible in different
contexts. Some examples are 

(i) Pincodes of places in India The Pincode of Vidisha in
Madhya Pradesh is 464001. The Pincode of Zemabawk in
Mizoram is 796017.

(ii) Mobile numbers.

(iii) Vehicle registration numbers.

Erasing half one more time would result in,

Halving 16 cm three times may be written as,

2.4 Powers of 10

We have used numbers like 10, 100, 1000, and so on when writing Indian
numerals in an expanded form. For example,

47561 = (4 x 10000) + (7 x 1000) + (5 x 100) + (6 x 10) + 1.
This can be written using powers of 10 as
(4 x 10*) + (7 x 10 ) + (5 x 10 ) + (6 x 10') + (1 x 10 ).

(2) write these numbers in the same way: (i) 172, (ii) 5642, (iii) 6374.

(2) How can we write 561.903?
_ lA 1. _1_
561.903 = (5 x 100) + (6x 10)+1+(9~x 10) + (0 x 100) + (3 x 1000."
Writing it using powers of 10, we have
561.903 = (5 x 102) + (6 x 10 ) + (1 x 10 ) + (9 x 10 ) + (0 x 107) + (3 x 10 ).

Scientific Notation

Let s look at some facts involving large numbers 
(i) The Sun is located 30,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,000 m from the
centre of our Milky Way galaxy.
(ii) The number of stars in our galaxy is 1,00,00,00,00,000.
(iii) The mass of the Earth is 59,76,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,000 kg.

As the number of digits increases, it becomes difficult to read the
numbers correctly. We may miscount the number of zeroes or place
commas incorrectly. We will then read the wrong value. It is like getting
~5,000 when you were supposed to get 50,000. The number of zeroes is
more important than the initial digits in several cases.

Can we use the exponential notation to simplify and read these very
large numbers correctly?

For example, the number 5900 can be expressed as 

5900 = 590 x 10 = 590 x 10 
= 59 x 100 = 59 x 10 
= 5.9 x 1000 = 5.9 x 10 
= 0.59 x 10000 = 0.59 x 10%.

Any number can be written as the product of a number between

1 and 10 and a power of 10. For example,

5900 = 5.9 x 10 20800 = 2.08 x 10 80,00,000 = 8 x 10 

2 Write the large-number facts we read just before in this form.

In scientific notation or scientific form (also called standard form),
we write numbers as x x 10 , where x > 1 and x < 10 is the coefficient and
y, the exponent, is any integer. Often, the exponent y is more important
than the coefficient x. When we write the 2 crore population of Mumbai
as 2 x 10 , the 7 is more important than the 2. Indeed, if the 2 is changed
to 3, the population increases by one-half, i.e., 2 crore to 3 crore, whereas
if the 7 is changed to 8, the change in population is 10 times, i.e., 2 crores
to 20 crores. Therefore, the standard form explicitly mentions the
exponent, which indicates the number of digits.

If we say that the population of Kohima is 1,42,395, then it gives the
impression that we are quite sure about this number up to the units
place. When we use large numbers, in most cases, we are more concerned
about how big a quantity or measure is, rather than the exact value. If
we are only sure that the population is around 1 lakh 42 thousand, we
can write it as 1.42 x 10 . If we can only be certain that it is around 1 lakh
40 thousand, we write it as 1.4 x 10 . The number of digits in the coefficient
reflects how well we know the number. The most important part of any

2.5 Did You Ever Wonder?

Last year, we looked at interesting thought experiments in the chapter
on Large Numbers. Let us continue this journey.

Nanjundappa wants to donate jaggery equal to Roxie s weight and
wheat equal to Estu s weight. He is wondering how much it would cost.

SA da

2 What would be the worth (in rupees) of the donated jaggery? What

would be the worth (in rupees) of the donated wheat?

In order to find out, let us first describe the relationships among the
quantities present.
Worth of jaggery (in rupees) = Roxie s weight in kg cost of 1 kg jaggery.
Worth of wheat (in rupees) = Estu s weight in kg x cost of 1 kg wheat.

(?) Make necessary and reasonable assumptions for the unknowns and find

the answers. Remember, Roxie is 13 years old and Estu is 11 years old.

Assuming Roxie s weight to be 45 kg and the cost of 1 kg of jaggery to be
~70, the worth of donated jaggery is 45 x 70 = %3150. Assuming Estu s
weight to be 50 kg and the cost of 1 kg of wheat to be 50, the worth of
donated wheat is 50 x 50 = #2500.

The practice of offering goods equal to the weight of a person, called
Tulabhara or seer is quite old and is still followed in many

places in Southe
a token of gratitu

ndia. It is a symbol of bhakti (surrendering oneself),
; it also supports the community.

2 Roxie wonders, Instead of jaggery if we use 1-rupee coins, how many

coins are needed to equal my weight? . How can we find out?

For questions like these, you can consider following the steps suggested
below.

1. Guessing: Make an instinctive (quick) guess of what the answer could
be, without any calculations.

~*~ Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

2. Calculating using estimation and approximation 

(i) Describe the relationships among the quantities that are needed
to find the answer.
(ii) Make reasonable assumptions and approximations if the required
information is not available.
(iii) Compute and find the answer (and check how close your guess
was).

Would the number of coins be in hundreds, thousands, lakhs, crores, or
even more? Make an instinctive guess.

(?) Find the answer by making necessary and
reasonable assumptions and approximations for | How about measuring
the unknowns. Remember, we are not looking for
an exact answer but a reasonably close estimate.

to find out the weight
of a 1-rupee coin?

Initially, your guesses may be very far off from the answer and
it is perfectly fine! You will get better at it like as you do it often
and in different situations. Guessing and estimating can build
intuition about numbers and various quantities.

Estu asks, What if we use 5-rupee coins or 10-rupee notes instead?
How much money could it be? 

(?) Make an instinctive guess first. Then find out (make necessary and
reasonable assumptions about the unknown details and find the
answers).

Estu says, When I become an adult, I would like to donate notebooks
worth my weight every year . Roxie says, When I grow up, I would like
to do annadana (offering grains or meals) worth my weight every year .

2 How many people might benefit from each of these offerings in a ( ati
year? Again, guess first before finding out. Talk
Roxie and Estu overheard someone saying We did padaydatra for
about 400 km to reach this place! We arrived early this morning. 

2 How long ago would they have started their journey?

Find answers by making necessary assumptions and approximations.
Do guess first before calculating to check how close your guess was!

Note to the Teacher: Assumptions can vary greatly at times, and as a result the
answers computed using these you can also vary. This is perfectly alright. Modelling
the situation properly is crucial, which can also be done in different ways sometimes.
The accuracy of the assumed numbers or quantities can get better with exposure
and practice.

Padayatra, is the traditional practice of walking long distances as part
of a religious or spiritual pursuit. People across religions in our country
observe similar forms of pilgrimage or spiritual walking, although they
may have different names or purposes.

Some of the pilgrimages are Ajmer Sharif Dargah Ziyarat,
Pandharpur Wari, Kanwar Yatra, Sabarimala Yatra, Sammed
Shikharji Yatra, Lumbini to Sarnath Yatra.
Before the rise of modern transport, people moved from one place to
another by walking sometimes merchants, sages, and scholars walked
thousands of kilometres to different parts of the world across deserts,
mountains, and rivers.

How many times can a person circumnavigate (go around the world) the
Earth in their lifetime if they walk non-stop? Consider the distance around
the Earth as 40,000 km.

Linear Growth vs. Exponential Growth

we actually had a ladder
like that, how many steps
would it have? .

Would the number of steps
be in thousands, lakhs,
crores, or even more?

To find out, we would
need to know the gap between consecutive steps of the ladder. Let s
assume a reasonable distance of 20 cm. Visualising the problem as shown,

If we calculate the value, we get the result as 1,92,20,00,000 steps, which
is 192 crore and 20 lakh steps or 1 billion 922 million steps. The fixed
increase in the distance from the earth with each step (a 20 cm gain after
each step) is called linear growth.

To cover the distance between the Earth and the Moon, it takes
1,92,20,00,000 steps with linear growth whereas it takes just 46 folds of
a piece of paper with exponential growth! Linear growth is additive,
whereas exponential growth is multiplicative.

Getting a Sense for Large Numbers

Last year, we learnt about lakhs and crores, as well as millions and
billions. A lakh is 10 (1,00,000), a crore is 10 (1,00,00,000), and an arab
is 10 (1,00,00,00,000), whereas a million is 10 (1,000,000) and a billion
is 10 (1,000,000,000).

You might know the size of the world s human population. Have you
ever wondered how many ants there might be in the world or how long ago
humans emerged? In this section, we shall explore numbers significantly
larger than arabs and billions. We shall use powers of 10 to represent and
compare these numbers in each case.

Very large quantities are often beyond our experience and
comprehension. To put them into perspective, we can relate and
compare them with quantities we are familiar with. This can
give an essence of how large a number or a measure is!

2.5 A Pinch of History

In the Lalitavistara, a Buddhist treatise from the first century BCE, we see
number-names for odd powers of ten up to 10 . The following occurs
as part of the dialogue between the mathematician Arjuna and Prince
Gautama, the Bodhisattva.

 Hundred kotis are called an ayuta (10 ), hundred ayutas a niyuta (10"),
hundred niyutas a kankara (10 ), .... hundred sarva-balas a visamjnagati (10* ), hundred visamjna-gatis a sarvajna (10), hundred sarvajnas
a vibhutangama (10 '), a hundred vibhutangamas is a tallakshana (10 ). 

Mahaviracharya gives a list of 24 terms (i.e., up to 10 ) in his treatise
Ganita-sara-sangraha. An anonymous Jaina treatise Amalasiddhi gives a
list with a name for each power of ten up to 10 (dasha-ananta). A Pali
grammar treatise of Kdccdyana lists number-names up to 10 , named
asankhyeya.

PowerPlay ~~

For expressing high powers of ten, Jaina and Buddhist texts use bases
like sahassa (thousand) and kofti (ten million); for instance, prayuta (10 )
would be dasa sata sahassa (ten hundred thousand).

The modern naming is similar to this, where we say,
A hundred 100 x 1000 = 1,00,000 10% x 10 = 10 
thousand is a lakh

A hundred lakhs 100 x 1,00,000 = 1,00,00,000 10? x 10 = 10 

is a crore

Ahundred crores 100 x 1,00,00,000 = 1,00,00,00,000 10% 10 =10 
is an arab

A hundred arab is 100 x 1,00,00,00,000 10? x 10 = 107"
a kharab = 1,00,00,00,00,000

Continuing this, a hundred kharab is a neel (10" ), a hundred neel is a
padma (10 ), a hundred padma is a shankh (10" ) and a hundred shankh

is a maha shankh (10").
In the American/International system, we say

A thousand thousand 1000 x 1000 = 1,000,000 10 x 10 = 10 
is a million

A thousand million is 1000 x 1,000,000 = 1,000,000,000 10 x 10 = 10 

a billion

A thousand billion is 1000 x 1,000,000,000 10? x 10 = 10 

an trillion = 1,00,000,000,000

Continuing this, a thousand trillion is a quadrillion (10 ). This pattern
continues. Observe the names million (10 ), billion (10 ), trillion (10 ),
quadrillion (10), quintillion (10'*), sextillion (107), septillion (10%),
octillion (107 ), nonillion (10 ), decillion (10 ).

2 What does the first part of each name denote?

The number 10' is also called a googol. The estimated number
of atoms in the universe is 10 to 10 . The number 10 8 is called a
googolplex. It is hard to imagine how large this number is!

The currency note with the highest denomination in India currently
is 2000 rupees. Guess what is the highest denomination of a currency
note ever, across the world. The highest numerical value banknote ever
printed was a special note valued 1 sextillion peng (10*' or 1 milliard
bilpeng6) printed in Hungary in 1946, but it was never issued. In 2009,
Zimbabwe printed a 100 trillion (10'*) Zimbabwean dollar note, which at
the time of printing was worth about $30.
