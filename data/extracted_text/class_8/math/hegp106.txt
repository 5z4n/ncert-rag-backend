We have seen how algebra makes use of letter symbols to write general
statements about patterns and relations in a compact manner. Algebra
can also be used to justify or prove claims and conjectures (like the many
properties you saw in the previous chapter) and to solve problems of
various kinds.

Distributivity is a property relating multiplication and addition that
is captured concisely using algebra. In this chapter, we explore different
types of multiplication patterns and show how they can be described in
the language of algebra by making use of distributivity.

6.1 Some Properties of Multiplication

Increments in Products
Consider the multiplication of two numbers, say, 23 x 27.

2 1. By how much does the product increase if the first number (23) is
increased by 1?

(?) 2. What if the second number (27) is increased by 1?
(?) 3. How about when both numbers are increased by 1?

2 Do you see a pattern that could help generalise our observations to the
product of any two numbers?

Let us first consider a simpler problem find the increase in the
product when 27 is increased by 1. From the definition of multiplication
(and the commutative property), it is clear that the product increases by
23. This can be seen from the distributive property of multiplication as
well. If a,b and c are three numbers, then

a(b+c)=ab+ac

This property can be visualised nicely using a diagram:

b columns c columns

a rows

a(b+c)

This is called the distributive property of multiplication over
addition. Using the identity a (b + c) = ab + ac with a = 23, b = 27, and
c= 1, we have

(~V~
23 (27 + 1) = 23 x 27 +23]

Increase

Remember that here, a (b + c) and 23 (27 + 1) mean a x (b + Cc), and
23 x (27 + 1), respectively. We usually skip writing the x symbol before
or after brackets, just as in the case of expressions like 5a, xy, etc.

We can also similarly expand (a + b) c using the distributive property
as follows 

(a+ b) c=c (a+b) (commutativity of multiplication)
= ca + cb (distributivity)
= ac + bc (commutativity of multiplication)

We can use the distributive property to find, in general, how much a
product increases if one or both the numbers in the product are increased
by 1. Suppose the initial two numbers are a and D. If one of the numbers,
say b, is increased by 1, then we have 

(VV
a(b+1)=ab~x [a]

Increase

Now let us see what happens if both numbers in a product are
increased by 1. If in a product ab, both a and b are increased by 1, then
we obtain (a + 1) (b+ 1).

~ Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

2 How do we expand this?

Let us consider (a + 1) as a single term. Then, by the distributive
property, we have

(a+ 1)(b+1)=(a+1)b+(a+1)1
Again applying the distributive
property, we obtain

If a = 23, and, b = 27, we get

( (Ww

(RY
@+norn-dofbeGetr (23 + 1) (27+ 1) = (23 +1) 27+ (23+) 1

ab +[6+a+D) -2327+[@7+23+D)|

Increase Increase

Thus, the product ab increases by a+ b + 1 when each of a and b are
increased by 1.

(?) What would we get if we had expanded (a+ 1) (b + 1) by first taking (b + 1)

as a Single term? Try it?

2 What happens when one of the numbers in a product is increased by 1

and the other is decreased by 1? Will there be any change in the product?
Let us again take the product ab of two numbers a and D. If a is
increased by 1 and b is decreased by 1, then their product will be (a + 1)
(b - 1). Expanding this, we get
If a = 23, and b = 27, we get
(a+ 1) (b-1) =(at+1)b-(a+1)1] (23+ 1) (27-1) = (23 + 1) 27-(23+1)1

=ab+ b-(a+1) = 23 x 27+27-(23 +1)
= ab +[b-a-1] = 23x 27+[27- 23-1
Increase Increase

Will the product always increase? Find 3 examples where the product
decreases.

(?) What happens when a and D are negative integers?

Check by substituting different values for a and b in each of the above
cases. For example, a =-5, b = 8; a=-4, b =-5; etc.

We have seen that integers also satisfy the distributive property, that
is, if x, yand z are any three integers, then x (y + Z) = xy + xz.

Thus, the expressions we have for increase of products hold when the
letter-numbers take on negative integer values as well.

Recall that two algebraic expressions are equal if they take on the
same values when their letter-numbers are replaced by numbers. These

We Distribute, Yet Things Multiply =

numbers could be any integers. Mathematical statements that express
the equality of two algebraic expressions, such as

a (b+ 8)=ab+ 8a,
(a+ 1)(b-1)=ab+b-a-1,etc.,
are called identities.

2 By how much will the product of two numbers change if one of the

numbers is increased by m and the other by n?

If a and b are the initial numbers being multiplied, they become
a+mandb+n.

(a+m (b+n=(a+mb+(at+mn

=ab+mb+an+mn

The increase is an + bm + mn.
Notice that the product is the sum of the product of each term of
(a + m) with each term of (b + n).

This identity can be visualised as follows 

b columns n columns

a rows

m YOows

(a+m) (b+n)

~ Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

2 This identity can be used to find how products change when the numbers
being multiplied are increased or decreased by any amount. Can you see
how this identity can be used when one or both numbers are decreased?

For example, let us reconsider the case when one number is increased
by 1 and the other decreased by 1. Let us write the product (a + 1) (b-1)
as (a+ 1) (b + (-1). Taking m = 1 and n =-1 in Identity 1, we have

ab + (1)xb+ax(-1)+ (1) x (1) =ab+b-a-1,
which is the same expression that we obtain earlier.
(?) Use Identity 1 to find how the product changes when
(i) one number is decreased by 2 and the other increased by 3;
(ii) both numbers are decreased, one by 3 and the other by 4.
(?) Verify the answers by finding the products without converting the
subtractions to additions.
Generalising this, we can find the product (a + u) (b- v) as follows.
(a+u)(b-v) =(a+tu)b-(at+wy

= ab + ub-(av+ uv)

=ab+ub-av-uv.

Check that this is the same as taking m = u and n = -v in Identity 1.

As in Identity 1, the product (a + u) (b- v) is the sum of the product of
each term of a + u (a and u) with each term of b - v (b and (-v)). Notice
that the signs of the terms in the products can be determined using the
usual rules of integer multiplication.

See how the rules of integer multiplication allows us to handle
multiple cases using a single identity!

2 Expand (i) (a-u) (b + v), Gi) (a-u) (b-v).
We get

(a u) (b+ v)=ab-ub+av-uwvy, and
(a u) (b- v) =ab-ub-av+wy.
The distributive property is not restricted to two terms within a bracket.
2 Example 1: Expand a (a- b+ 3).

F(a-b+ 5) = x a- Ex b) + xs).

The terms can be simplified as follows 

32x q=3x (axa).

Yet Things Multiply <

We Distribute,

Using exponent notation, we can write 7 x(axa)= 7 a .
3ay p= 3 -3

3a, 1_(3y,1),-3
7 Xs=Gx5)a=794a

So we get
34 (g_p+4)=3q2-3 =e
7 (a-b+<s)=5a-5ab+75 a.

(?) Can any two terms be added to get a single term?

For example, can 7 a and sy a be added to get a single term?

We see that no two terms have exactly the same letter-numbers,
which would have allowed them to be simplified into a single term. So,
a further simplification of the expression is not possible.

Recall that we call terms having the same letter-numbers like terms.
2 Example 2: Expand (a + b) (a + b).
We have (a+ b) (a+ b) = (a+b) at (a+ b)b=axat+bxa+ab+bxb
=a + ba+ab+b?

Since ba = ab, we have two terms having the same letter-numbers ab
(or, that are like terms), and so can be added 
ba + ab = ab + ab = 2ab
So we get
(a+ b) (a+ b) =a + 2ab + b .

2 Example 3: Expand (a + b) (a* + 2ab + b ).

(a + b) (a*+ 2ab + b*) = (a+ b)a*+ (a+ b) x 2ab + (a+ b)b 
= (a x a ) + ba + (a x 2ab) + (b x 2ab) + ab*+ (b x b )

The terms can be simplified as follows 
a x a = a (why?)

ba = a b
ax 2ab=2xaxaxb=2a b
bx 2ab=2xaxbxb=2ab*
bx b*=b 
So, (a + b)(a? + 2ab + b ) = a + a b + 2a b + 2ab + ab + b .
We see that a*b and 2a b have the same letter-numbers (or, are like
terms) and so can be added 

- Ganita Prakash | Grade 8

ab + 2a b = (1+ 2) a b = 3a b.
Similarly, ab* and 2ab are like terms and so can be added 
ab + 2ab = (1 + 2)ab* = 3ab .

Thus, we have
(a + b) x (a? + 2ab +b ) = a3 + 3a b + 3ab + b?.

A Pinch of History

The distributive property of multiplication over addition was implicit
in the calculations of mathematicians in many ancient civilisations,
particularly in ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, China, and India. For
example, the mathematicians Euclid (in geometric form) and Aryabhata
(in algebraic form) used the distributive law in an implicit manner
extensively in their mathematical and scientific works. The first explicit
statement of the distributive property was given by Brahmagupta in his
work Brahmasphutasiddhanta (Verse 12.55), who referred to the use of
the property for multiplication as khanda-gunanam (multiplication by
parts). His verse states, The multiplier is broken up into two or more
parts whose sum is equal to it; the multiplicand is then multiplied by
each of these and the results added . That is, if there are two parts, then
using letter symbols this is equivalent to the identity (a + b) c=ac + bce. In
the next verse (Verse 12.56), Brahmagupta further describes a method
for doing fast multiplication using this distributive property, which we
explore further in the next section.

Fast Multiplications Using the Distributive Property

The distributive property can be used to come up with quick methods of
multiplication when certain types of numbers are multiplied.

When one of the numbers is 11, 101, 1001, ...

2 Use the following multiplications to find the product of a number with

11 in a single step.

(a) 3874 x 11 (b) 5678 x 11
Let us take the first multiplication.
3874 x 11 = 3874 (10 + 1) = 38740 + 3874
+ 3874

Notice how the digits are getting added.

Let us take a 4-digit number dcba, that is, the number that has din the
thousands place, c in the hundreds place, b in the tens place and ain the
units place.

dcba x (10 + 1) = dcba x 10 + dcba.

Such methods of applying the distributive property to easily multiply
two numbers were discussed extensively in the _ ancient
mathematical works of Brahmagupta (628 CE), Sridharacharya
(750 CE) and Bhaskaracharya (Lilavati, 1150 CE). In his work
Brahmasphutasiddhanta (Verse 12.56), Brahmagupta refers to such
methods for fast multiplication using the distributive property as
ista-gunana.

6.2 Special Cases of the Distributive Property

Square of the Sum/Difference of Two Numbers

2 The area of a square of sidelength 60 units is 3600 sq. units (607) and that
of a square of sidelength 5 units is 25 sq. units (5 ). Can we use this to
find the area of a square of sidelength 65 units?

A square of sidelength 65 can be split into 4 regions as shown in the
figure a square of sidelength 60, a square of sidelength 5, and two
rectangles of sidelengths 60 and 5. The area of the square of sidelength 65
is the sum of the areas of all its constituent parts. Can you find the areas
of the four parts in the figure above? 60 5
We get
65 = (60 + 5) = 607 + 5*+ 2 x (60 x 5).

= 3600 + 25 + 600 = 4225 sq. units.

Let us multiply (60 + 5) x (60 + 5) using the

distributive property. 60

(60 + 5) x (60 +5) = 60 x 60+5x60+60x5+5%x5
= 60 + 2 x (60 x 5) +57.

What if we write 65 as (30 + 35) or (52 + 13)? 5

2 Can we use 60 (=3600) and 5 (=25) to find the value of (60 5) or 55 ?
Let us approach this through geometry by drawing a square of side
length 55 sitting inside a square of sidelength 60.

Area of a square of sidelength 55 is (60 - 5)? = 55 .

60 55

60x60 -5~x 60

We can get the area of
the square of sidelength
55 by taking the area of
the square of sidelength
60 and removing the areas
of the two rectangles of
sidelengths 60 and 5, i.e.,
60 - (60 x 5) - (5 x 60).
By doing this, we remove the
area of the small square of
sidelength 5 twice. What can
we do with this expression to
get the actual area?

We can add back the area
of the square of sidelength 5
to this expression. That way,
we are only subtracting this
area once.

So,

(60 5)* = 60 - (60 x 5) (5 x 60) + 5?
= 3600 300 - 300 + 25
= 3025.
The area of the square of sidelength 55 is 3025 sq. units.

expansion of (a b) ?

(a+ b) + (a b) = (a + 2ab + b ) + (a - 2ab + b )

Adding the like terms a + a = 2a , b + b = 2b and 2ab 2ab = 0,

=k +1+2k-1 =k +2k =k+k+k =k +2k
=k? +2k =k +2k

When carried out correctly, all methods lead to the same answer;
k + 2k. The expression k + 2k gives the number of circles at Step k of this
pattern.

In Mathematics, there are often multiple ways of looking at
a pattern, and different ways of approaching and solving the
same problem. Finding such ways often requires a great deal
of creativity and imagination! While one or two of the ways
might be your favourite(s), it can be amusing and enriching to
explore other ways as well.

2 Find the area of the (interior) shaded region in the figure below. All four
&

rectangles have the same dimensions.

Tadang s method:
The total region is a square of side (m + n) with an area IN
(m+n).

Subtracting the area of four rectangles from the total h
area will give the area of the interior shaded region.
That is, (m+n)*- 4mn. Ro

Yusuf s method:
The shaded region is a square with sidelength (n - m). So,
its area is (n-m) .

(?) By expanding both expressions,
check that (m + n)? 4mn = (n= m/).

Find out the area of the region with slanting lines in the
figure. All three rectangles have the same dimensions
(Fig. 1).

Anusha s method:

Required area = Area (ABCD) Area (EFGH)
Area of ABCD = x .

Area of EFGH = xy.

Required area = x xy.

Vaishnavi s method:

QS=y+xty
=x + 2y.
Area of PQSR = x (x + 2y) arly
Required area = Area of PQSR - (area of the three

rectangles)
= X (X + 2y) - 3xy.

Pe e Ganita Prakash | Grade 8
Aditya s method:
The required area is 2 times the area of JKLM.

JK= 2 , KM=x

Area (JKML) = x ( 37)
Required area = 2 x Area of JKML

(?) By expanding the expressions, verify that all three expressions are
equivalent. If x = 8 and y = 3, find the area of the shaded region.
