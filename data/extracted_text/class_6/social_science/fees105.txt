India, That Is Bharat

In India at a very early time the spiritual and cultural unity was
made complete and became the very stuff of the life of all this great
surge of humanity between the Himalayas and the two seas.

Today, the India we know is a modern nation, with defined
borders, defined states and a known population. However,
it was very different 500 years ago, 2,000 years ago or even
5,000 years ago. This region of the world, which we often call
the Indian Subcontinent , has had many different names
and shifting boundaries. We can learn about India s past
and evolution from many different sources. Let us explore.

Consider the physical map of the Indian Subcontinent at
the start of the chapter. What are its natural boundaries
that you can make out?

travellers and pilgrims, and inscriptions.

How Indians Named
India

The Rig Veda is India s most ancient
text; as we will see in Chapter 7,
it is several thousand years old.
It gives the northwest region of
the Subcontinent the name Sapta
Sindhava , that is, the land of the
seven rivers . The word Sindhava 
comes from Sindhu , which refers
to the Indus River, or at times to a
river in general.

Moving on in time, we see names for other parts of India
appear in the literature. The Mahabharata is one of India s
most famous texts (we read about it in the theme Our
Cultural Heritage and Knowledge Traditions ). Interestingly,
it lists many regions, such as Kashmira (more or less today s
Kashmir), Kurukshetra (parts of Haryana today), Vanga
(parts of Bengal), Pragjyotisha (roughly today s Assam),
Kaccha (today s Kutch), Kerala (more or less today s Kerala),
and so on.

LET'S EXPLORE

Do you recognise the names of any regions given in the map
(Fig. 5.4) on page 79? List the ones that you have heard of.

But when do we come across a name for the entire Indian
Subcontinent? Because ancient Indian texts are difficult to
date, this is not an easy question to answer. The Mahabharata
uses the terms Bharatavarsha and Jambudvipa , and
scholars generally agree that this long poem was written
from a few centuries BCE onward.

The first term, Bharatavarsha , clearly extends to the entire
Subcontinent, and the text includes the names of numerous
rivers and peoples. Bharatavarsha means the country of
the Bharatas . Bharata is a name that first appears in the
Rig Veda, where it refers to one of the main Vedic groups
of people. In later literature, several kings named Bharata 
are mentioned.

The second term, Jambudvipa , means the island of the
fruit of the jamun tree . This is indeed a common tree native
to India, also called jambul tree , Malabar plum tree , etc.
 Jambudvipa came to mean the Indian Subcontinent.

In fact, we get a good clue from an Indian emperor his
name is Ashoka and we will meet him later; for now, we
can take his date to be about 250 BCE. As we will see, he
left us many inscriptions. In one of them, he used the same

A few centuries later, Bharata became the name generally
used for the Indian Subcontinent. For instance, in an ancient
text called the Vishnu Purana, we read:

This name, Bharata remains in use even today. In north
India, it is generally written as Bharat , while in south
India, it is often Bharatam .

Y THINK ABOUT IT 

Have you identified the snowy mountains ? Do you think this
brief description of Bharata is correct?

It is interesting to note that different parts of the country
adopted a similar definition for India. For instance, a poem
of ancient Tamil literature, from about 2,000 years ago,
praises a king whose name is known from [Cape] Kumari
in the south, from the great mountain in the north, from
the oceans on the east and on the west... You can now
recognise the great mountain in the north , and it should

| nothe difficult to identify Cape Kumari . It looks like ancient
Indians knew their geography well!

The Indian Constitution, which was first written in English,
uses the phrase India, that is Bharat right at the beginning.
Similarly, the Hindi version of the Constitution mentions the
same as Bharat arthath India .

In this reproduction of the first page of the original Constitution
of India in Fig. 5.5 (page 82), can you make out the phrase
 India, that is Bharat ?

How Foreigners Named India

The first foreigners to mention India were the Persians,
the ancient inhabitants of Iran. In the 6" century BCE, a
Persian emperor launched a military campaign and gained
control of the region of the Indus River, which, as we saw,
was earlier called Sindhw . So, it is no surprise that in their
earliest records and stone inscriptions, the Persians referred
to India as Hind , Hidw or Hindu , which are adaptations
in their language of Sindhw . (Note that in ancient Persian,
 Hindw is a purely geographical term; it does not refer here
to the Hindu religion.)

Based on these Persian sources, the ancient Greeks named
the region Indoi or Indike . They dropped the initial letter
 h of Hindw because this letter did not exist in their Greek
language.

5 India, That Is Bharat

Sindhu => Hindhu => Indoi/Indike

The ancient Chinese also interacted with India. In several
texts, they refer to India as Yintw or Yindu . This word also
originally comes from Sindhu , in the following manner:

Sindhu ==> Hindhu => Indu => Yindu

Xuanzang (formerly spelt Hiuen Tsang, Hsuan
Tsang, etc.) travelled from China to India in the
7" century CE. He visited many parts of India, met
scholars, collected Buddhist texts, and returned
to China after 17 years. There, he translated
the manuscripts he took back with him from
Sanskrit into Chinese. Several other Chinese
scholars visited India over the centuries.

Another Chinese word, also derived from
 Sindhu , was Tianzhu ; but this word could
also be understood as heavenly master . This
reflects the respect the ancient Chinese had
for India as the land of the Buddha.

You are probably quite familiar with a
more recent term, Hindustan , but you may |
not know that it was first used in a Persian @
inscription some 1,800 years ago! Later on, this became

the term used by most invaders of India to describe the

Indian Subcontinent.

India is an ancient land, which has had many names in the
course of its history.

The names given by the ancient inhabitants of India
include Jambudvipa and Bharata . The latter became
widespread in time and is the name of India in most
Indian languages.

Foreign visitors to, or invaders of, India mostly adopted
names derived from the Sindhu or Indus River; this
resulted in names like Hindu , Indoi , and eventually
 India .

Questions, activities and projects

1.

Discuss what could be the meaning of the quotation at the
start of the chapter.

True or false?

> The Rig Veda describes the entire geography of India.

> The Vishnu Purana describes the entire Subcontinent.

> In Ashoka s time, J]ambudvipa included what is today
India, parts of Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan.

> The Mahabharata lists many regions, including
Kashmir, Kutch, and Kerala.

> Theterm Hindustan first appeared in a Greek
inscription more than 2,000 years ago.

> Inancient Persian, the word Hindw refers to the
Hindu religion.

> Bharata is a name given to India by foreign travellers.

If you were born some 2,000 years ago and had the chance
to name our country, what name or names might you have
chosen, and why? Use your imagination!

Why did people travel to India from various parts of the
world in ancient times? What could be their motivations

in undertaking such long journeys? (Hint: There could be at
least four or five motivations)
