When you are doing any work, do not think of anything beyond. Do
it as worship, as the highest worship, and devote your whole life to
it for the time being.

LET'S EXPLORE

What activities did the people in Anu s and Kabir s story
engage in? Mention them in the table given below:

Character in the Activities they
are engaged in

Different types of activities, like the ones discussed above,
are divided into two groups or categories: economic
activities and non-economic activities.

Economic activities are those that involve money or are

performed in exchange for money or money s worth for the Money s

parties involved. For example, a business person selling worth: The

activity or a non-economic activity? How is it different
from your teachers teaching you at school? Discuss
with your classmates.

Types of Economic Activities

Kavya was excited to go to her aunt s house in the village of
Kamlapur. On the way, she saw that a highway was being
built near the village, and the construction site was abuzz
with activity. Large machines, such as excavators and
bulldozers, were being operated by dedicated technicians.

This new highway promised to reduce
the travel time to the nearest town
from five hours to just two hours.
Kavya thought that she would be able
to visit her aunt more often once the
highway was ready, since it would
take less time to travel there. Happy
with this thought, Kavya ran to greet
her aunt and to eat the delicious
jalebis that she had made. They were
joined by Kavya s uncle, who had
just returned home from work. He
is a technician in a construction company and operates a
bulldozer. He receives a monthly salary for his services.

The next day, Kavya s aunt woke up early to finish her
share of the household chores and left for work. She is

employed at the village post office and is
paid a monthly salary. In the evening, after
her office work, she also conducts online
classes to help students prepare for school
exams. She charges a weekly fee for these
classes.

On the weekend, Kavya visited a local
mango orchard with her aunt to have some
delicious mangoes.

There she saw Sahil, a farm labourer who
was using a tractor to till a farmer s land nearby. He earns
a daily wage for his efforts. He gets some payment for his
work in cash, and the remaining part of the payment in
the form of mangoes of equal value. The mangoes that he
receives as a part of his work are called payment in kind.

Y THINK ABOUT IT

On your way from home to school today, can you recall the
various economic activities that people are engaged in? In
what ways do you think those people are paid?

As we now understand, economic activities are those that
have value in terms of money. Economic activities also add
value at each stage of the process of transforming something into another form. This is called value addition.

Let us take the example of Kavya s father, Rajesh, to
understand this.

The wood for the chair costs 600. So, what is the remaining
400 (%1,000 600) for? It is the monetary value of Rajesh s
skill, time and effort, which went into making that chair.
Rajesh has added value to the wood by turning it into
furniture. From buying the wood to selling the chair, these
activities involve payment. They are, therefore, a part of
economic activities.

The Importance of Non-Economic

Activities

While non-economic activities may not involve money, the

value they generate is important in our lives.

Seva: selfless service

We see sevd in many places such as temples, gurudwaras,
mosques and churches. For instance, langars or community
kitchens at gurudwaras serve food to every visitor for free.
These practices foster a sense of satisfaction and gratitude

for what we have, and they are also a way of contributing
to society without expecting anything in return.

Van Mahotsav

Langar at the Golden Temple

The strength of community
participation

The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is
based on the collective efforts
of all Indian citizens to keep our
surroundings clean. Individually,
we keep our homes and surroundings clean. People have also come
together to clean up streets, roads,
parks and other public places
or community areas. Together,
these efforts lead to a clean home,
neighbourhood, society and nation.

Another example of collective
community participation is the
celebration of Van Mahotsav (the
festival of forests) in India to
promote awareness about the
value of trees and the conservation

of forests. The initiative brings together members of the
community for tree plantation drives.

VY THINK ABOUT IT

 Many communities in India have similar practices that

involve community participation. Can you identify a few
from your area?

We celebrate many festivals in India. During these
festivals, people gather to organise all the various
activities. They decorate the place together and share the
food that they cook. Are these non-economic activities?
Why do you think they still hold value?

Can you identify community programmes that have been
undertaken by your school or in your locality? What did
you observe during these programmes?

In this chapter, we learnt about economic and noneconomic activities.

We also learnt about the value addition that economic
activities create.

We understood how non-economic activities contribute to
social welfare, personal wellbeing and enhance the overall

quality of life.
