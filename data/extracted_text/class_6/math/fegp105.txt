Idli-Vada Game
Children sit in a circle and play a game of numbers.
One of the children starts by saying 1 . The second
@ payer says 2 , and so on. But when it is the turn of 3, 6,

.. (multiples of 3), the player should say idli instead

ot the number. When it is the turn of 5, 10, ... (multiples

os of 5), the player should say vada instead of the number.

When a number is both a multiple of 3 and a multiple

of 5, the player should say idli-vada ! If a player makes
any mistake, they are out.

The game continues in rounds till only one person CA

- remains.
 For which numbers should the players say idli 
instead of saying the number? These would be 3, 6, 9,
12, 18, ... and so on.
For which numbers should the players say vada ?
These would be 5, 10, 15, 20, ... and so on.
Which is the first number for which the players
should say, idli-vada ? It is 15, which is a multiple of 3,

Jump Jackpot

Jumpy and Grumpy play a game.
e Grumpy places a treasure on some number. For example, he
may place it on 24.
e Jumpy chooses a jump size. If he chooses 4, then he has to
jump only on multiples of 4, starting at 0.
e Jumpy gets the treasure if he lands on the number where
Grumpy placed it.

Which jump sizes will get Jumpy to land on 24?
If he chooses 4: Jumpy lands on 4 > 8 > 12 > 16 > 20 > 24> 28 =...
Other successful jump sizes are 2, 3, 6, 8 and 12.

Sy ltt ae eee eee a ae ia a Se Te ies

What about the jump of sizes 1 and 24? Yes, they also will land
on 24.

The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 all divide 24 exactly. Recall that
such numbers are called factors or divisors of 24.

Grumpy increases the level of the game. Two treasures are kept
on two different numbers. Jumpy has to choose a jump size and stick
to it. Jumpy gets the treasures only if he lands on both the numbers
with the chosen jump size. As before, Jumpy starts at 0.

Grumpy has kept the treasures on 14 and 36. And, Jumpy chooses
a jump size of 7.

Will Jumpy land on both the treasures? Starting from 0, he jumps
to 7 > 14 = 21 > 28 > 35 > 42... We see that he landed on 14 but

Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

did not land on 36, so he does not get the treasure. What jump size
should he have chosen?

The factors of 14 are: 1, 2, 7, 14. So, these jump sizes will land on 14.

The factors of 36 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 36. These jump sizes
will land on 36.

So, the jump sizes of 1 or 2 will land on both 14 and 36. Notice that
1 and 2 are the common factors of 14 and 36.

The jump sizes using which both the treasures can be reached are
the common factors of the two numbers where the treasures are
placed.

% What jump size can reach both 15 and 30? There are multiple
jump sizes possible. Try to find them all.

5.2 Prime Numbers

Guna and Anshu want to pack figs (anjeer) that grow in their farm.
Guna wants to put 12 figs in each box and Anshu wants to put 7 figs
in each box.
How many arrangements are possible?

Think and find out the different ways how 

1. Guna can arrange 12 figs in a rectangular manner.

2. Anshu can arrange 7 figs in a rectangular manner.

Guna has listed out these possibilities.

Observe the number of rows and

columnsineach ofthe arrangements.
How are they related to 12?

In the second arrangement, for
example, 12 figs are arranged in two

columns of 6 each or 12 = 2 x 6.

Anshu could make only one
arrangement: 7 x 1 or 1 x 7. There are
no other rectangular arrangements
possible.

In each of Guna s arrangements,
multiplying the number of rows by
the number of columns gives the [TELL]
number 12. So, the number of rows
or columns are factors of 12.

We saw that the number 12 can be arranged in a rectangle in
more than one way as 12 has more than two factors. The number 7
can be arranged in only one way, as it has only two factors 1 and 7.

Numbers that have only two factors are called prime numbers or
primes. Here are the first few primes 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19. Notice
that the factors of a prime number are 1 and the number itself.

What about numbers that have more than two factors? They
are called composite numbers. The first few composite numbers
are 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20.

Prime Time

What about 1, which has only one factor? The number 1 is neither
a prime nor a composite number.
% How many prime numbers are there from 21 to 30? How many
composite numbers are there from 21 to 30?
Can we list all the prime numbers from 1 to 100?
Here is an interesting way to find prime numbers. Just follow the
steps given below and see what happens.

Step 1: Cross out 1 because it is neither prime nor composite.

so on.
Step 5: Continue this process till all the numbers in the list are either
circled or crossed out.

All the circled numbers are prime It is definitely not some
numbers. All the crossed out numbers, oie ty itworke y
other than 1, are composite numbers. This
method is called the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

This procedure can be carried on
for numbers greater than 100 also.
Eratosthenes was a Greek mathematician
who lived around 2200 years ago and
developed this method of listing primes.

Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

Guna and Anshu started wondering how this simple method is able
to find prime numbers! Think how this method works. Read the steps
given above again and see what happens after each step is carried out.

Prime numbers are the building blocks of all whole numbers. Starting
from the time of the Greek civilisation (more than 2000 years ago) to
this day, mathematicians are still struggling to uncover their secrets!

Food for thought: is there a largest prime number? Or does the
list of prime numbers go on without an end? A mathematician named
Euclid found the answer and so will you in a later class!

Fun fact: The largest prime number that anyone has written down 
is so large that it would take around 6500 pages to write it! So they
could only write it on a computer!

We see that 2 is a prime and also an even number. Is there any
other even prime?

5.3 Co-prime Numbers for Safekeeping Treasures

Which pairs are safe?

Let us go back to the treasure finding game. This time, treasures are
kept on two numbers. Jumpy gets the treasures only if he is able to
reach both the numbers with the same jump size. There is also a
new rule a jump size of 1 is not allowed.

% Where should Grumpy place the treasures so that Jumpy cannot
reach both the treasures?

Will placing the treasure on 12 and 26 work? No! If the jump size
is chosen to be 2, then Jumpy will reach both 12 and 26.

What about 4 and 9? Jumpy cannot reach both using any jump size
other than 1. So, Grumpy knows that the pair 4 and 9 is safe.

Check if these pairs are safe:

a. 15 and 39 b.4 and 15

c. 18 and 29 d. 20 and 55

Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

What is special about safe pairs? They don t have any common
factor other than 1. Two numbers are said to be co-prime to each
other if they have no common factor other than 1.

Example: As 15 and 39 have 3 as a common factor, they are not
co-prime. But 4 and 9 are co-prime.

% Which of the following pairs of numbers are co-prime?

a. 18 and 35 b. 15 and 37 c. 30 and 415
d. 17 and 69 e. 81 and 18

% While playing the idli-vada game with different number ! 
pairs, Anshu observed something interesting!
1. Sometimes the first common multiple was the same Talk

as the product of the two numbers.
2. At other times the first common multiple was less
than the product of the two numbers.
Find examples for each of the above. How is it related to the

number pair being co-prime?

%F Observe the following thread art. The first diagram has 12 _ 
pegs and the thread is tied to every fourth peg (we say that
the thread-gap is 4). The second diagram has 13 pegs and the Talk
thread-gap is 3. What about the other diagrams? Observe these
pictures, share and discuss your findings in class.

In some diagrams, the thread is tied to every peg. In some, it is
not. Is it related to the two numbers (the number of pegs and the
thread-gap) being co-prime?

5.4 Prime Factorisation

Checking if two numbers are co-prime

Teacher: Are 56 and 63 co-prime?

Anshu and Guna: If they have a common factor other than 1, then
they are not co-prime. Let us check.

Anshu: I can write 56 = 14 x 4and 63 = 21 x 3. So, 14 and 4
are factors, of 56. Further, 21 and 3 are factors of
63. So, there are no common factors. The numbers
are co-prime.

Guna: Hold on. I can also write 56 = 7 x 8 and 63 = 9 x 7.
We see that 7 is a factor of both numbers, so, they
are not co-prime.

Clearly Guna is right, as 7 is acommon factor.
%e But where did Anshu go wrong?

Writing 56 = 14 x 4 tells us that 14 and 4 are both factors of 56, but it
does not tell all the factors of 56. The same holds for the factors of 63.

Try another example: 80 and 63. There are many ways to factorise
both numbers.

80 = 40x 2=20x4=10x 8=16x5=???

63=9x7=3x21=???

We have written ??? to say that there may be more ways to
factorise these numbers. But if we take any of the given factorisations,
for example, 80 = 16 x 5 and 63 = 9 x 7, then there are no common
factors. Can we conclude that 80 and 63 are co-prime? As Anshu s
mistake above shows, we cannot conclude that as there may be other
ways to factorise the numbers.

What this means is that we need a more systematic approach to
check if two numbers are co-prime.

Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

Prime factorisation

Take a number such as 56. It is composite, as we saw that it can be
written as 56 = 4x 14.So, both 4 and 14 are factors of 56. Now take one
of these, say 14. It is also composite and can be written as 14 = 2 x 7.
Therefore, 56 = 4 x 2 x 7. Now, 4 is composite and can be written as
4=2.x 2. Therefore, 56 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 7. All the factors appearing here, 2
and 7, are prime numbers. So, we cannot divide them further.

In conclusion, we have written 56 as a product of prime numbers.
This is called prime factorisation of 56. The individual factors are
called prime factors. For example, the prime factors of 56 are 2 and 7.

Every number greater than 1 has a prime factorisation. The idea
is the same: keep breaking the composite numbers into factors till
only primes are left.

The number 1 does not have any prime factorisation. It is not
divisible by any prime number.

What is the prime factorisation of a prime number like 7? It is just
7 (we cannot break it down any further).

Let us see a few more examples.

By going through different ways of breaking down the number,
we wrote 63 as 3 x 3 x 7 and as 3 x 7 x 3. Are they different? Not
really! The same prime numbers 3 and 7 occur in both cases. Further,
3 appears two times in
both and 7 appears once.

Here, you see four
different ways to get
prime factorisation of 36.
Observe that in all four
nen get two 2s and

Multiply back to see
that you get 36 in all four cases.

For any number, itis aremarkable fact that there is only one prime
factorisation, except that the prime factors may come in different

Prime Time

orders. As we explain below, the order is not important. However,
as we Saw in these examples, there are many ways to arrive at the
prime factorisation!

Does the order matter?

Using this diagram,
can you explain why 30 = 2 x 3 x 5, no matter which way you multiply
2, 3, and 5?

When multiplying numbers, we can do so in any order. The
end result is the same. That is why, when two 2s and two 3s are
multiplied in any order, we get 36. In a later class, we shall study
this under the names of commutativity and associativity of
multiplication.

Thus, the order does not matter. Usually we write the prime
numbers in increasing order. For example, 225=3x3x5x5 or 30=
2x3x 5.

Prime factorisation of a product of two numbers
When we find the prime factorisation of a number, we first write
it as a product of two factors. For example, 72 = 12 x 6. Then, we
find the prime factorisation of each of the factors. In the above example,
12=2x2x3and6=2 x3.Now, can you say what the prime factorisation
of 72 is?

The prime factorisation of the original number is obtained by
putting these together.

72=2x2x3x2x3

Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

We can also write this as 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3. Multiply and check that
you get 72 back!

Observe how many times each prime factor occurs in the
factorisation of 72.

Compare it with how many times it occurs in the factorisations of
12 and 6 put together.

% Figure it Out

1. Find the prime factorisations of the following numbers: 64, 104,

5. What is the smallest number whose prime factorisation has:

a. three different prime numbers?
b. four different prime numbers?

Prime factorisation is of fundamental importance in the study of
numbers. Let us discuss two ways in which it can be useful.

Using prime factorisationto check if two numbers are co-prime
Let us again take the numbers 56 and 63. How can we check if they
are co-prime? We can use the prime factorisation of both numbers 
56=2x2x2x7and63=3x3x7
Now, we see that 7 is a prime factor of 56 as well as 63. Therefore,
56 and 63 are not co-prime.
What about 80 and 63? Their prime factorisations are as follows:

80=2x2x2x2x5and63=3x3x7

There are no common prime factors. Can we conclude that they
are co-prime? Suppose they have a common factor that is composite.
Would the prime factors of this composite common factor appear in
the prime factorisation of 80 and 63?

Prime Time
Se ee a a a a ap a a a a a 4b ap a ~~ a ap ab a a a a aa a ~~ a 4p a a 4p a a a a a,

Therefore, we can say that if there are no common prime factors,
then the two numbers are co-prime.
Let us see some examples.

Example: Consider 40 and 231. Their prime factorisations are as
follows:
40=2x2x2x5and231=3x7x11
We see that there are no common primes that divide both 40 and
231. Indeed, the prime factors of 40 are 2 and 5 while, the prime
factors of 231 are 3, 7, and 11. Therefore, 40 and 231 are co-prime!

Example: Consider 242 and 195. Their prime factorisations are as
follows:

242 =2x 11x 11and195=3 x5 x 13

The prime factors of 242 are 2 and 11. The prime factors of 195
are 3,5, and 13. There are no common prime factors. Therefore, 242
and 195 are co-prime.

Using prime factorisation to check if one number is divisible
by another
We can say that if one number is divisible by another, the prime
factorisation of the second number is included in the prime
factorisation of the first number.

We say that 48 is divisible by 12 because when we divide 48 by 12,
the remainder is zero. How can we check if one number is divisible
by another without carrying out long division?

Example: Is 168 divisible by 12? Find the prime factorisations of both:
168=2x2x2x3x7and12=2x2x3
Since we can multiply in any order, now it is clear that,
168=2x2x3x2x7=12x14
Therefore, 168 is divisible by 12.
Example: Is 75 divisible by 21? Find the prime factorisations of both:
75=3x5x5and21=3x7

Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

As we Saw in the discussion above, if 75 was a multiple of 21, then
all prime factors of 21 would also be prime factors of 75. However, 7
is a prime factor of 21 but not a prime factor of 75. Therefore, 75 is
not divisible by 21.

Example: Is 42 divisible by 12? Find the prime factorisations of both:
42=2x3x7and12=2x2x3

All prime factors of 12 are also prime factors of 42. But the prime
factorisation of 12 is not included in the prime factorisation of 42.
This is because 2 occurs twice in the prime factorisation of 12 but
only once in the prime factorisation of 42. This means that 42 is not
divisible by 12.

We can say that if one number is divisible by another, then the
prime factorisation of the second number is included in the prime
factorisation of the first number.

5.5 Divisibility Tests

So far, we have been finding factors of numbers in different contexts,
including to determine if a number is prime or not, or if a given pair
of numbers is co-prime or not.

Prime Time

It is easy to find factors of small numbers. How do we find factors
of a large number?

Let us take 8560. Does it have any factors from 2 to 10 (2, 3, 4,
5, ..., 9, 10)?

It is easy to check if some of these numbers are factors or not
without doing long division. Can you find them?

Divisibility by 10
Let us take 10. Is 8560 divisible by 10? This is another way of
asking if 10 is a factor of 8560.

For this, we can look at the pattern in the multiples of 10.

The first few multiples of 10 are: 10, 20, 30, 40, ... Continue this
sequence and observe the pattern.

Is 125 a multiple of 10? Will this number appear in the previous
sequence? Why or why not?

Can you now answer if 8560 is divisible by 10?

Divisibility by 4
Checking if a number is divisible by 4 can also be done easily!

Look at its multiples: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, ...

Are you able to observe any patterns that can be used? The
multiples of 10, 5 and 2 have a pattern in their last digits which we
are able to use to check for divisibility. Similarly, can we check if a
number is divisible by 4 by looking at the last digit?

It does not work! Look at 12 and 22. They have the same last digit,
but 12 is a multiple of 4 while 22 is not. Similarly 14 and 24 have the
same last digit, but 14 is not a multiple of 4 while 24 is. Similarly, 16
and 26 or 18 and 28. What this means is that by looking at the last
digit, we cannot tell whether a number is a multiple of 4.

Can we answer the question by looking at more digits? Make a list
of multiples of 4 between 1 and 200 and search for a pattern.

We have seen that long division is not always needed to check ifa
number is a factor or not. We have made use of certain observations
to come up with simple methods for 10, 5, 2, 4, 8. Do we have such

you? Why do you say so?

Look at the what Guna s classmates have to share:

e Karnawati says, 9 is special because it is a single-digit
number whereas all the other numbers are 2-digit numbers .

e Gurupreet says, 9 is special because it is the only number
that is a multiple of 3 .

e Murugan says, 16 is special because it is the only even
number and also the only multiple of 4 .

e Gopika says, 25 is special as it is the only multiple of 5 .

e Yadnyikee says, 43 is special because it is the only prime
number .

Rules

Fill the grid with prime numbers only so that the product of each row
is the number to the right of the row and the product of each column
is the number below the column.

Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

sh

= Ifanumber is divisible by another, the second number is called a factor
of the first. For example, 4 is a factor of 12 because 12 is divisible by 4
(12 +4=3).

= Prime numbers are numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ... that have only two
factors, namely 1 and themselves.

= Composite numbers are numbers like 4, 6, 8, 9, ... that have more
than 2 factors, i.e., at least one factor other than 1 and themselves. For
example, 8 has the factor 4 and 9 has the factor 3, so 8 and 9 are both
composite.

= Every number greater than 1 can be written as a product of prime
numbers. This is called the number s prime factorisation. For example,
84=2x2x3x7.

= There is only one way to factorise a number into primes, except for
the ordering of the factors.

= Two numbers that do not have a common factor other than 1 are said
to be co-prime.

= To check if two numbers are co-prime, we can first find their prime
factorisations and check if there is a common prime factor. If there is no
common prime factor, they are co-prime, and otherwise they are not.

= A number is a factor of another number if the prime factorisation of
the first number is included in the prime factorisation of the second
number.
