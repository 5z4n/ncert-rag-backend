In this chapter, we will explore some of the most basic ideas of
geometry including points, lines, rays, line segments and angles.
These ideas form the building blocks of plane geometry , and will
help us in understanding more advanced topics in geometry such as
the construction and analysis of different shapes.

2.1 Point

aa

Mark a dot on the paper with a sharp tip of a pencil. The sharper the
tip, the thinner will be the dot. This tiny dot will give you an idea of
a point. A point determines a precise location, but it has no length,
breadth or height. Some models for a point are given below.

The tip of a The sharpened The pointed
compass end of a pencil end of a needle

If you mark three points on a piece of paper,
you may be required to distinguish these three
points. For this purpose, each of the three points
may be denoted by a single capital letter such as

Z, P and T. These points are read as Point Z , Point P and Point T . Of
course, the dots represent precise locations and must be imagined to be
invisibly thin.

2.2 Line Segment

Fold a piece of paper and unfold it. Do you
see a crease? This gives the idea of a line
segment. It has two end points, A and B.
Mark any two points A and B on a sheet of
paper. Try to connect A to B by various B
routes (Fig. 2.1).
What is the shortest route from A to B? B
This shortest path from Point A to Point B
(including A and B) as shown here is called
the line segment from A to B. It is denoted by
either AB or BA. The points A and B are called

the end points of the line segment AB. Pig. 2.1

2.3 Line

Imagine that the line segment from A to B (.e.,
AB) is extended beyond A in one direction and
beyond B in the other direction without any
end (see Fig. 2.2). This is a model for a line. Do A
you think you can draw a complete picture of Fig. 2.2
a line? No. Why? _ 

A line through two points A and B is written as AB. It extends
forever in both directions. Sometimes a line is denoted by a letter like
lorm.

Observe that any two points determine a unique line that passes
through both of them.

Lines and Angles

2.4 Ray

A ray is a portion of a line that starts at one point (called the starting
point or initial point of the ray) and goes on endlessly in a direction.
The following are some models for a ray:

Beam of light from a Ray of light from a torch Sun rays
lighthouse

Look at the diagram (Fig. 2.3) of a ray. Two points are
marked on it. One is the starting point A and the other P
isa point P on the path of the ray. We then denote the
ray by AP.

2.5 Angle D
An angle is formed by two rays having a we
common starting point. Here is an angle
formed by rays BD and BE where B is vertex
the common starting point (Fig. 2.8). arm
The point B is called the vertex of the
 E
angle, and the rays BD and BE are called Fig. 2.8

the arms of the angle. How can we name
this angle? We can simply use the vertex and say that it is the Angle B.
To be clearer, we use a point on each of the arms together with the
vertex to name the angle. In this case, we name the angle as Angle DBE
or Angle EBD. The word angle can be replaced by the symbol 2 , Le.,
ZDBE or ZEBD. Note that in specifying the angle, the vertex is always
written as the middle letter.

To indicate an angle, we use a small curve at the vertex (refer
to Fig. 2.9).

Vidya has just opened her book. Let us observe her opening the
cover of the book in different scenarios.

Case 1 Case 2 Case 3 Case 4 Case 5 Case 6

Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

%F Do you see angles being made in each of these cases? Can you mark
their arms and vertex?

Which angle is greater the angle in Case 1 or the angle in Case 2?

Just as we talk about the size of a line based on its length, we also
talk about the size of an angle based on its amount of rotation.

So, the angle in Case 2 is greater as in this case she needs to rotate
the cover more. Similarly, the angle in Case 3 is even larger than that
of Case 2, because there is even more rotation, and Cases 4, 5, and 6
are successively larger angles with more and more rotation.

The size of an angle is the amount of rotation or turn that is needed
about the vertex to move the first ray to the second ray.

Final position of ray

Amount of turn is the size of
the angle

Let s look at some other examples where angles arise in real life
by rotation or turn:

e Inacompass or divider, we turn the arms to form
an angle. The vertex is the point where the two
arms are joined. Identify the arms and vertex of
the angle.

e A pair of scissors has two blades. When we open
them (or turn them ) to cut something, the blades
form an angle. Identify the arms and the vertex of
the angle.

Lines and Angles

 Look at the pictures of spectacles, wallet and other common
objects. Identify the angles in them by marking out their arms
and vertices.

Do you see how these angles are formed by turning one arm with
respect to the other?

them with a curve as in Fig. 2.9.

all down, and mark each of them with a curve as in Fig. 2.9.

2.6 Comparing Angles

Look at these animals opening their mouths. Do you see any angles
here? If yes, mark the arms and vertex of each one. Some mouths are
open wider than others; the more the turning of the jaws, the larger
the angle! Can you arrange the angles in this picture from smallest to
largest?

CF Is it always easy to compare two angles?

Here are some angles. Label each of the angles. How will you
compare them?
Draw a few more angles; label them and compare.

Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

Comparing angles by superimposition
Any two angles can be compared by placing them one over the other,
i.e., by superimposition. While superimposing, the vertices of the
angles must overlap.

After superimposition, it becomes clear which angle is smaller
and which is larger.

B Cc Q R Q(B) RC

The picture shows the two angles superimposed. It is now clear
that ZPQR is larger than ZABC.

Equal angles. Now consider ZAOB and /ZXOY in the figure. Which
is greater?

Xx Xx
J. /
O B O Y O B Y

The corners of both of these angles match and the arms overlap with
each other, i.e., OA < OX and OB < OY. So, the angles are equal in size.
The reason these angles are considered to be equal in size is
because when we visualise each of these angles as being formed out
of rotation, we can see that there is an equal amount of rotation
_ _ _ _ _ _
needed to move OB to OA and OY to OX.

From the point of view of superimposition, when two angles
are superimposed, and the common vertex and the two rays of
both angles lie on top of each other, then the sizes of the angles
are equal.

Comparing angles without superimposition
Two cranes are arguing
about who can open their
mouth wider, i.e., who is
making a bigger angle.

Let us first draw their
angles. How do we know
which one is bigger? As seen Fig. 2.10

before, one could trace these angles, superimpose them and then
check. But can we do it without superimposition?

Suppose we have a transparent circle which can be moved and
placed on figures. Can we use this for comparison?

Let us place the circular paper on the angle made by the first
crane. The circle is placed in such a way that its centre is on the
vertex of the angle. Let us mark the points A and B on the edge circle
at the points where the arms of the angle pass through the circle.

Can we use this to find out if this angle is greater than, or equal to
or smaller than the angle made by the second crane?

Let us place it on the angle made by the second crane so that the
vertex coincides with the centre of the circle and one of the arms
passes through OA.

Can you now tell
which angle is bigger?

Lines and Angles

Which crane was making the bigger angle?
If you can make a circular piece of transparent paper, try this method
to compare the angles in Fig. 2.10 with each other.

2.7 Making Rotating Arms

Let us make rotating arms using two paper straws and a paper clip
by following these steps:
1. Take two paper straws and a paper clip.

2. Insert the straws into the arms of the paper
clip.

3. Your rotating arm is ready!

Make several rotating arms with different angles between the
arms. Arrange the angles you have made from smallest to largest by
comparing and using superimposition.

Passing through a slit: Collect anumber of rotating arms with different
angles; do not rotate any of the rotating arms during this activity.

Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

Take a cardboard and make an angle-shaped slit as shown below
by tracing and cutting out the shape of one of the rotating arms.

\ /~)

Now, shuffle and mix up all the rotating arms. Can you identify
which of the rotating arms will pass through the slit?

The correct one can be found by placing each of the rotating arms
over the slit. Let us do this for some of the rotating arms:

Slit angle is greater than Slit angle is less than the Slit angle is equal to the
the arms angle. Thearms arms angle. The arms arms angle. The arms will
will not go through the will not go through the go through the slit.

slit. slit.

Only the pair of rotating arms where the angle is equal to that of the
slit passes through the slit. Note that the possibility of passing through
the slit depends only on the angle between the rotating arms and not
on their lengths (as long as they are shorter than the length of the slit).

Challenge: Reduce
this angle. Angle The angle is still
reduced. ; the same!

2.8 Special Types of Angles

Let us go hack to Vidya s
notebook and observe her
opening the cover of the book
in different scenarios.

She makes a full turn of the
cover when she has to write
while holding the book in
her hand.

She makes a half turn of the
cover when she has to open
it on her table. In this case,
observe the arms of the angle formed. They lie in a straight line.
Such an angle is called a straight angle.

A O B
Fig. 2.11

Let us consider a straight angle ZAOB. Observe that any ray oc
divides it into two angles, ZAOC and ZCOB.

Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

; ; ~~ a)
42 Is it possible to draw OC such that the two angles are
equal to each other in size? Talk

Let s Explore

We can try to solve this problem using a piece of paper. Recall that when
a fold is made, it creates a crease which is straight.

Take a rectangular piece of paper and on one of its sides, mark
the straight angle AOB. By folding, try to get a line (crease) passing
through O that divides ZAOB into two equal angles.

How can it be done?

Fold the paper such that OB overlaps with OA. Observe the crease
and the two angles formed.

Lines and Angles

Justify why the two angles are equal. Is there a way to
superimpose and check? Can this superimposition be done by
folding?

Each of these equal angles formed are called right angles. So, a
straight angle contains two right angles.

Because they're
always right.

Why shouldn't you
argue with a 90 
angle?

%& If a straight angle is formed by half of a full turn, how much of a
full turn will form a right angle?

Observe that a right angle resembles the shape of an L . An angle
is a right angle only if it is exactly half of a straight angle. Two lines
that meet at right angles are called perpendicular lines.

b. Describe how you folded the paper so that any other person
who doesn t know the process can simply follow your
description to get the right angle.

Classifying Angles
Angles are classified in three groups as shown below. Right angles

are shown in the second group. What could be the common feature
of the other two groups?

In the first group, all angles are less than a right angle or in other
words, less than a quarter turn. Such angles are called acute angles.

In the third group, all angles are greater than a right angle but
less than a straight angle. The turning is more than a quarter turn
and less than a half turn. Such angles are called obtuse angles.

1. Identify acute, right, obtuse and straight angles in the previous
figures.

sharp and obtuse means blunt. Why do you think these words have
been chosen?

2.9 Measuring Angles

We have seen how to compare two angles. But can we actually
quantify how big an angle is using a number without having to
compare it to another angle?

We saw how various angles can be compared using a circle.
Perhaps a circle could be used to assign measures for angles?

Fig. 2.12

To assign precise measures to angles, mathematicians came up
with an idea. They divided the angle in the centre of the circle into

Lines and Angles

360 equal angles or parts. The angle measure of each of these unit
parts is 1 degree, which is written as 1 .

This unit part is used to assign measure to any angle: the measure
of an angle is the number of 1 unit parts it contains inside it.
For example, see this figure:

30 units

>
It contains 30 units of 1 angle and so we say that its angle measure is 30 .

Measures of different angles: What is the measure of a full turn in
degrees? As we have taken it to contain 360 degrees, its measure is 360 .

%eF What is the measure of a straight angle in degrees? A straight
angle is half of a full turn. As a full-turn is 360 , a half turn is 180 .
What is the measure of a right angle in degrees? Two right angles
together form a straight angle. As a straight angle measures 180 , a
right angle measures 90 .

A pinch of history
A full turn has been divided into 360 . Why 360? The reason why
we use 360 today is not fully known. The division of a circle into

Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

360 parts goes back to ancient times. The Rigveda, one of the very
oldest texts of humanity going back thousands of years, speaks of
a wheel with 360 spokes (Verse 1.164.48). Many ancient calendars,
also going back over 3000 years such as calendars of India, Persia,
Babylonia and Egypt were based on having 360 days in a year. In
addition, Babylonian mathematicians frequently used divisions of 60
and 360 due to their use of sexagesimal numbers and counting by 60s.
Perhaps the most important and practical answer for why
mathematicians over the years have liked and continued to use 360
degrees is that 360 is the smallest number that can be evenly divided
by all numbers up to 10, aside from 7. Thus, one can break up the
circle into 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 equal parts, and still have a whole
number of degrees in each part! Note that 360 is also evenly divisible
by 12, the number of months in a year, and by 24, the number of
hours in a day. These facts all make the number 360 very useful.

%& The circle has been divided into 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8,9 10 and 12 parts
below. What are the degree measures of the resulting angles? Write
the degree measures down near the indicated angles.

Degree measures of different angles

How can we measure other angles in degrees? It is for this purpose
that we have a tool called a protractor that is either a circle divided
into 360 equal parts as shown in Fig. 2.12 (on page 32), or a half
circle divided into 180 equal parts.

Labelled protractor

This is a protractor that you find in your geometry box. It would
appear similar to the protractor above except that there are numbers
written on it. Will these make it easier to read the angles?

There are two sets of numbers on the protractor: one increasing
from right to left and the other increasing from left to right. Why
does it include two sets of numbers?

xe Name the different angles in the figure and write their measures.

How can we measure angles directly without having to subtract?

You may have wondered how the different equally spaced markings are

made on a protractor. We will now see how we can make some of them!

1. Draw a circle of a convenient radius on a sheet of paper. Cut out
the circle (Fig. 2.13). A circle or one full turn is 360 .

2. Fold the circle to get two equal halves and cut it through the
crease to get a semicircle. Write O in the bottom right corner of
the semicircle.

Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

\Fig. 2.13

The measure of half
a circle is of a full
turn. (Fig. 2.14)
So, the measure of
half a turn = 7 of
180 f 0 }}= 180 .

the left bottom corner
of the semicircle.

3. Fold the semi-circular sheet in half as shown in Fig. 2.15 to form
a quarter circle.

The measure of a
quarter circle is j of a
full turn.

The measure of

t turn = j of 360 =

Or, the measure ofa :
turn = 7 of a half turn
= 5 of 180 =

Thus, mark 90 at the
top of the semicircle.

4. Fold the sheet again as shown in Figs. 2.16 and 2.17:

Fig. 2.16 Fig. 2.17

When folded, this is 7 of the circle, or Z of a turn, or 7 of 360 ,
or Z of 180 or Z of 90 = .

The new creases formed give us measures of 45 and
180 45 = 135 as shown. Write 45 and 135 at the correct
places on the new creases along the edge of the semicircle.

5. Continuing with another half fold as shown in Fig. 2.18, we get
an angle of measure

6. Unfold and mark the creases as OB, OC, ..., etc., as shown in
Fig.2.19 and Fig. 2.20.

In Fig. 2.19, we have ZAOB = ZBOC = ZCOD = ZDOE = ZEOF = ZFOG =
ZGOH = ZHOI= . Why?

Angle Bisector

At each step, we folded in halves. This process of getting half of a
given angle is called bisecting the angle. The line that bisects a given
angle is called the angle bisector of the angle.

Identify the angle bisectors in your handmade protractor. Try to make
different angles using the concept of angle bisector through paper folding.

2.10 Drawing Angles

Vidya wants to draw a 30 angle and name it ZTIN using a protractor.

 In ZTIN, I will be the vertex, IT and IN will be the arms of the angle.
Keeping one arm, say IN, as the reference (base), the other arm IT should :
: - take a turn of 30 .

Lines and Angles

 _>
Step 1: We begin with the base and draw IN:

ooo
I N

Step 2: We will place the centre point of the protractor on I and align
IN to the 0 line.

Step 3: Now, starting from 0, count your degrees (0, 10, 30) up to 30
on the protractor. Mark point T at the label 30 .

Step 4: Using a ruler join the point I and T.
ZTIN = 30 is the required angle.

%F Let s Play a Game #1

This is an angle guessing game! Play this game with your classmates
by making two teams, Team 1 and Team 2. Here are the instructions
and rules for the game:

Team 1 secretly choose an angle measure, for example, 49 and
makes an angle with that measure using a protractor without
Team 2 being able to see it.

Team 2 now gets to look at the angle. They have to quickly
discuss and guess the number of degrees in the angle (without
using a protractor!).

Team 1 now demonstrates the true measure of the angle with
a protractor.

Team 2 scores the number of points that is the absolute
difference in degrees between their guess and the correct
measure. For example, if Team 2 guesses 39 , then they score
10 points (49 -39 ).

Each team gets five turns. The winner is the team with the
lowest score!

%F Let s Play a Game #2

We now change the rules of the game a bit. Play this game with your
classmates by again making two teams, Team 1 and Team 2. Here
are the instructions and rules:

Lines and Angles

e Team 1 announces to all, an angle measure, e.g., 34 .

e Aplayer from Team 2 must draw that angle on the board without
using a protractor. Other members of Team 2 can help the player
by speaking words like Make it bigger! or Make it smaller! .

e A player from Team 1 measures the angle with a protractor
for all to see.

 Team 2 scores the number of points that is the absolute
difference in degrees between Team 2 s angle size and the
intended angle size. For example, if player s angle from Team 2
is measured to be 25 , then Team 2 scores 9 points (34 -25 ).

e Each team gets five turns. The winner is again the team with the
lowest score.

2.11 Types of Angles and their Measures

We have read about different types of angles in this chapter. We
have seen that a straight angle is 180 and a right angle is 90 . How
can other types of angles acute and obtuse be described in terms
of their degree measures?

Acute Angle: Angles that are smaller than the right angle, ie., less
than 90 and are greater than 0 , are called acute angles.

than the whole angle, Le., greater than 180 and less than 360 , are
called reflex angles.

measure, you get an acute angle. If you triple my measure, you
will get an acute angle again. If you quadruple (four times) my
measure, you will get an acute angle yet again! But if you multiply
my measure by 5, you will get an obtuse angle measure. What are
the possibilities for my measure?

= A point determines a location. It is denoted by a capital letter.

= A line segment corresponds to the shortest distance between two
points. The line segment joining points S and T is denoted by ST.

= A line is obtained when a line segment like ST is extended on both
sides indefinitely; it is denoted by ST or sometimes by a single small
letter like m.

= Arayisa portion ofa line starting at a point D and going in one direction
indefinitely. It is denoted by DP where P is another point on the ray.

= Anangle canbe visualised a as two rays starting from a common starting
point. Two rays OP and OM form the angle 7POM (also ci called MOP);
here, O is called the vertex of the angle, and the rays OP and OM are

called the arms of the angle.

= The size of an angle is the amount of rotation or turn needed about the
vertex to rotate one ray of the angle onto the other ray of the angle.

= The sizes of angles can be measured in degrees. One full rotation or
turn is considered as 360 degrees and denoted as 360 .

= Degree measures of angles can be measured using a protractor.

= Angles can be straight (180 ), right (90 ), acute (more than 0 and less
than 90 ), obtuse (more than 90 and less than 180 ), and reflex (more
than 180 and less than 360 ).
