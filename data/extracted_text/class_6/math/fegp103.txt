Numbers are used in different contexts and in many different ways
to organise our lives. We have used numbers to count, and have
applied the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication
and division on them, to solve problems related to our daily lives.

In this chapter, we will continue this journey, by playing with
numbers, seeing numbers around us, noticing patterns, and learning
to use numbers and operations in new ways.

List five different situations in which numbers are used. See what
your classmates have listed, share, and discuss.

3.1 Numbers can Tell us Things

What are these numbers telling us?

Some children ina park are @ @ ina line. Each one says a number.

4 What do you think these numbers mean?

The children now rearrange themselves, and again each one
says a number based on the arrangement.

Hint: Could their heights be playing a role?

A child says 1 if there is only one taller child standing next to them.
A child says 2 if both the children standing next to them are taller.
A child says 0 , if neither of the children standing next to them are taller.
That is each person says the number of taller neighbours they have.

 Os Try answering the questions below and share your reasoning. : a 
1. Can the children rearrange themselves so that the children
standing at the ends say 2 ?
2. Can we arrange the children in a line so that all would say
only 0s?
. Can two children standing next to each other say the same
number?

4. There are 5 children in a group, all of different heights. Can
they stand such that four of them say 1 and the last one says
 0 ? Why or why not?

3.2 Supercells

Observe the numbers written in the table below. Why are some
numbers coloured? Discuss.

A cell is coloured if the number in it is larger than its adjacent
cells. The number 626 is coloured as it is larger than 577 and 345,
whereas 200 is not coloured as it is smaller than 577. The number
198 is coloured as it has only one adjacent cell with 109 in it, and 198
is larger than 109.

3.6 The Magic Number of Kaprekar

D.R. Kaprekar was a mathematics teacher in a
government school in Devlali, Maharashtra. He liked
playing with numbers very much and found many
beautiful patterns in numbers that were previously
unknown.

In 1949, he discovered a fascinating and magical Ba
phenomenon when playing with 4-digit numbers.

*The answer is yes! For 3-digit numbers the answer is unknown. It is suspected that
starting with 196 never yields a palindrome!

Numbers in the middle column are added in different ways to get
the numbers on the sides (1500 + 1500 + 400 = 3400). The numbers in
the middle can be used as many times as needed to get the desired
sum. Draw arrows from the middle to the numbers on the sides to
obtain the desired sums.

d. 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2,1
Do you see how these sequences were formed?

The rule is: one starts with any number; if the number is even,
take half of it; if the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1;
repeat.

Notice that all four sequences above eventually reached the
number 1. In 1937, the German mathematician, Lothar Collatz
conjectured that the sequence will always reach 1, regardless of
the whole number you start with. Even today despite many
mathematicians working on it it remains an unsolved problem as
to whether Collatz s conjecture is true! Collatz s conjecture is one of
the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics.

with your favourite whole numbers. Do you always reach 1?

will eventually reach 1? Why or why not?

3.11 Simple Estimation
Oe

At times, we may not know or need an exact count of things and
an estimate is sufficient for the purpose at hand. For example,
your school headmaster might know the exact number of students
enrolled in your school, but you may only know an estimated
count. How many students are in your school? About 150? 400? A
thousand?

Paromita s class section has 32 children. The other 2 sections of
her class have 29 and 35 children. So, she estimated the number of
children in her class to be about 100. Along with Class 6, her school
also has Classes 7-10 and each class has 3 sections each. She assumed
a similar number in each class and estimated the number of students
in her school to be around 500.

We shall do some simple estimates. It is a fun exercise, and you may
find it amusing to know the various numbers around us. Remember,

Q3. Fill the table below such that we get as many supercells as possible. Use numbers
between 100 and 1000 without repetitions.

Ans.

Q4. Out of the 9 numbers, how many supercells are there in the table above?
Ans. 5
Q5 Find out how many supercells are possible for different numbers of cells.

Do you notice any pattern? What is the method to fill a given table to get the
maximum number of supercells? Explore and share your strategy.

Ans. For even number of cells say,2,4,6,... the number of supercells would be respectively,
2/2 =1,4/2 =2,6/2=3,...
For odd number of cells , say 1,3,5,7,... the number of supercells would be respectively
(1+1)/2= 1, (3+1)/2 = 2, (5+1)/2= 3,(7+1)/2 = 4...
To get the maximum number ofsupercells, we have to start by filling the first cell as
super cell & then fill alternately.

Q6. Can you fill a supercell table without repeating numbers such that there are no
supercells? Why or why not?

Ans. No; the cell which is filled by the greatest number among the given numbers chosen, will
become super cell irrespective of its position in the table.

Q7. Will the cell having the largest number in a table always be a supercell? Can the cell
having the smallest number in a table be a supercell? Why or why not?

Ans. Yes, the largest number in a table will always be a supercell.

No, the smallest number in a table can never be a supercell as the number in all the
adjacent cells will be greater than it.

Q8. Fill a table such that the cell having the second largest number is not a supercell.
Ans. One of the ways could be1)/2/3)4)5/6)/7|91|8

15,000 and 16,000? Yes, it is possible. Explore how. What thousands cannot be made?
Ans. No; the only number which is smaller than 1000 is 400 and 1000 is not a multiple of 400.
14000 = 1500 x 8 + 400 x 5
= 12000 + 2000
= 14000
15000 = 13000 + 400 x 5
= 13000 + 2000
= 15000
16000 = 1500 x 8 + 400 x 10
= 12000 + 4000
= 16000
Only one thousand (1000) cannot be made.

Q.1. Write an example for each of the below scenarios whenever possible.
Could you find examples for all the cases? If not, think and discuss what could be
the reason. Make other such questions and challenge your classmates.
Ans.
e 5 digit +5 digit > 90,250
45,000 + 45,400 = 90,400 > 90,250
e 5 digit + 3 digit = 6 digit sum
99,999 + 999 = 100,998
e 4 digit + 4 digit = 6 digit sum
Not possible as even the sum of the greatest 4 digit numbers will not give a six
digit sum. (9999 + 9999 = 19,998)

[9]

e 5 digit+5 digit = 6 digit sum
60,000 + 40,000 = 1,00,000
e 5 digit + 5 digit = 18,500
Not possible as smallest 5-digit number is 10,000.
If both the numbers are 10,000 then the sum is 20,000, which is more than
18,500.
e 5 digit 5 digit < 56,503
80,000 50,000 < 56,503
< 56,503
e 5 digit 3 digit =4 digit difference
10,000 999 = 9001
e 5 digit 4 digit =4 digit difference
12,000 2,500 = 9,500
e 5 digit 5 digit =3 digit difference
50,999 50,000 = 999
e 5 digit 5 digit = 91,500
Not possible as the difference of the greatest and the smallest 5 digit numbers,
the maximum difference, can be 99,999 10,000 = 89,999
Some examples of other such questions are1. 5 digit +5 digit = 7 digit sum
2. 4 digit + 4 digit = 2900
More such examples can be made.

Q.2. Always, Sometimes, Never?

Below are some statements. Think, explore and find out if each of the statement is
 Always true , Only sometimes true or Never true . Why do you think so? Write
your reasoning; discuss this with the class.

a. 5-digit number + 5-digit number gives a 5-digit number

b. 4-digit number + 2-digit number gives a 4-digit number

c. 4-digit number + 2-digit number gives a 6-digit number

d. 5-digit number 5-digit number gives a 5-digit number

e. 5-digit number 2-digit number gives a 3-digit number

Ans. a. Only sometimes true.
20,000 + 80,000 = 1,00,000 not a 5 digit number
b. Only sometimes true
9,999 + 99 = 10,098 not a 4 digit number
c. Never true
9,999 + 99 = 10,098
On adding the greatest 4 digit and the greatest 2 digit numbers, we can reach only 5
digit number 10,098. So there is no possibility of getting a 6 digit number.
d. Only sometimes true
Ex. 12,000 10,000 = 2,000
5 digit 5 digit = 4 digit
e. Never true
Ex. 10,000 99 = 9901

Yes we always reach 1.
The even numbers are halved and when we have an odd number we convert it into
an even number by multiplying by 3 and adding | so that eventually it can be halved
again. The smallest even number is 2 so we will reach 1 for sure.
