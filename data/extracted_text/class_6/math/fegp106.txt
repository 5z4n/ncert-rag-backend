6.1 Perimeter

Do you remember what the perimeter of a closed plane figure is?
Let us refresh our understanding!

The perimeter of any closed plane figure is the distance covered
along its boundary when you go around it once. For a polygon, i.e.,
a closed plane figure made up of line segments, the perimeter is
simply the sum of the lengths of its all sides, i.e., the total distance
along its outer boundary.

The perimeter of a polygon = the sum of the lengths of its all sides.

Let us revise the formulas for the perimeter of rectangles, squares,
and triangles.

Perimeter of a rectangle

Consider a rectangle ABCD whose length and breadth are 12 cm and

8 cm, respectively. What is its perimeter?

Perimeter of the rectangle = Sum of the lengths of its four sides
=AB+BC+CD+DA

A 12 cm B

8cm

=AB+BC+AB+BC

Opposite sides of a

= 2x AB +2 * BC rectangle are always
= 2 x (AB + BC) equal. So, AB = CD and
= 2x (12 cm +8 cm) AD = BC

= 2 x (20 cm)

= 40 cm.

From this example, we see that 

Perimeter of a rectangle = length + breadth + length + breadth.
Perimeter of a rectangle = 2 x (length + breadth).

The perimeter of a rectangle is twice the sum of its length and breadth.

Perimeter of a square

Debojeet wants to put coloured tape all around
a square photo frame of side 1m as shown.
What will be the length of the coloured tape
he requires? Since Debojeet wants to put the
coloured tape all around the square photo
frame, he needs to find the perimeter of the
photo frame.

Thus, the length of the tape required =
perimeter of the square

= sum of the lengths of all four sides of the square
=1m+1m+1im+im=4m.

Now, we know that all four sides of a square are equal in length.
Therefore, in place of adding the lengths of each side, we can simply
multiply the length of one side by 4.

Thus, the length of the tape required = 4x 1m=4m.

From this example, we see that

Perimeter of a square = 4 x length of a side.
The perimeter of a square is quadruple the length of its side.

Perimeter of a triangle

Consider a triangle having three given sides of ot ,
lengths 4 cm, 5 cm and 7 cm. Find its perimeter. Ka
Perimeter of the triangle = 4cm+5cm+7cm

= 16cm. 7em

Perimeter of a triangle = sum of the lengths of its three sides.

Example: Akshi wants to put lace all around a
rectangular tablecloth that is 3 m long and 2 m
wide. Find the length of the lace required.

Solution

Length of the rectangular table cover = 3 m.
Breadth of the rectangular table cover = 2 m.

Akshi wants to put lace all around the

tablecloth.

Therefore, the length of the lace required will be the perimeter of the

rectangular tablecloth.

Now, the perimeter of the rectangular tablecloth = 2 x (length + breadth)
=2x(3m+2m)
=2x5m=10m.

Hence, the length of the lace required is 10 m.

Example: Find the distance travelled by Usha if she takes three rounds of
a square park of side 75 m.

Solution
Perimeter of the square park = 4 x length
of a side = 4 75 m = 300 m.
Distance covered by Usha in one
round = 300 m.
Therefore, the total distance travelled by
Usha in three rounds = 3 x 300 m = 900 m.

Perimeter of a regular polygon

Like squares, closed figures that have all sides and all angles equal
are called regular polygons. We studied the sequence of regular
polygons as Shape Sequence #1 in Chapter 1. Examples of regular
polygons are the equilateral triangle (where all three sides and all
three angles are equal), regular pentagon (where all five sides and
all five angles are equal), etc.

Perimeter of an equilateral triangle
We know that for any triangle its perimeter A
is sum of all three sides.

Using this understanding, we can find the
perimeter of an equilateral triangle.
Perimeter of an equilateral triangle

Let s see some real-life problems related to these ideas.

Example: A floor is 5 m long and 4 m wide. A square carpet of sides 3 m
is laid on the floor. Find the area of the floor that is not carpeted.
Solution

Length of the floor = 5 m.

Width of the floor = 4m.

Area of the floor = length x width = 5 mx 4m=20 sqm.

Length of the square carpet = 3 m.

Area of the carpet = length x length = 3m x 3 m=9sqm.

Hence, the area of the floor laid with carpet is 9 sq m.

Therefore, the area of the floor that is not carpeted is: area of the floor
minus the area of the floor laid with carpet = 20 sg m-9sqm=11sqm.

Example: Four square flower beds each of side 4 m are in four corners

Solution
Length of the land (J) = 12 m.
Width of land (w) = 10 m.

Area of the whole land = 1x w=12 mx 10m=120 sqm.

The sidelength of each of the four square flower beds is (s) = 4m.

Area of one flower bed =sxs=4mx4m=16sqm.

Hence, the area of the four flower beds = 4 x 16 sq m = 64 sq m.

Therefore, the area ofthe remaining part of the land is: area of the complete
land minus the area of all four flower beds = 120 sq m - 64 sq m = 56 sq m.

Q. Using 9 unit squares, solve the following.
1. What is the smallest perimeter possible?
2. What is the largest perimeter possible?
3. Make a figure with a perimeter of 18 units.

4. Can you make other shaped figures for each of the above three perimeters, or is
there only one shape with that perimeter?

What is your reasoning?
Ans. 1. The smallest possible perimeter is 12 cm obtained from a square of side 3 cm

2. The largest possible perimeter is 20 cm. obtained from a rectangle of length 9 cm and
breadth 1 cm.

Q. Below is the house plan of Charan. It is in a rectangular plot. Look at the plan. What
do you notice?

Some of the measurements are given.

a. Find the missing measurements.
b. Find out the area of his house.
Ans. a.

i. Small bedroom 15ft x 12ft
Area = 180 sq ft

ii. Utility 15ft x 3ft
Area = 45 sq ft

iii. Hall 20ft x 12ft
Area = 240 sq ft

iv. Parking 15ft 3ft
Area = 45 sq ft

v. Garden 20ft x 3ft
Area = 60 sq ft

b. Area of his house = 35ft x 30ft
=1050 sq ft

Q. Now, find out the missing dimensions and area of Sharan s home. Below is the plan:
Some of the measurements are given.
a. Find the missing measurements.
b. Find out the area of his house.

What are the dimensions of all the different rooms in Sharan s house? Compare the
areas and perimeters of Sharan s house and Charan s house.

Ans. a. Dimensions of Sharan s house.
i. Utility 7ft x 10 ft
Area = 70 sq ft

ii. Hall 23ft x 15 ft
Area = 345 sq ft

iii. Entrance 7 ft x 15ft
Area = 105 sq ft

iv. Small bedroom 12ft x 10ft
Area = 120 sq ft

Vv. Toilet 5ft x 10 ft
[5]

Area = 50 sq ft

b. Area of his house = 42 ft x 25 ft
= 1050 sq ft

Area of Charan s house = 35ft x 30 ft = 1050 sq ft
Area of Sharan s house = 42 ft x 25ft = 1050 sq ft
Area of both the houses are equal.

Now, Perimeter of Charan s house = 130 ft
Perimeter of Sharan s house = 134 ft

Perimeter of Sharan s house is greater than the Perimeter of Charan s house.

Q.4. Four flower beds having sides 2 m long and 1 m wide are dug at the four corners of
a garden that is 15 m long and 12 m wide. How much area is now available for laying
down a lawn?

Ans. Available area for lawn = 172 sq. m.

Q.5. Shape A has an area of 18 square units and Shape B has an area of 20 square units.
Shape A has a longer perimeter than Shape B. Draw two such shapes satisfying the
given conditions.

Ans. Possible dimensions of shape A are 6m and 3m; 2m and 9m; 18m and 1m
Corresponding Perimeters =18 m, 22m, 38m respectively
Possible dimensions of shape B are 5m and 4m; 10m and 2m; 20m and Im
Corresponding Perimeters =18m, 24m, 42m respectively
Given P(A) > P(B)
We may take P(A) = 22m or 38m and P(B) = 18 m and draw the figures accordingly.
