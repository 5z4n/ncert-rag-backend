Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

Now, arm yourself with a ruler and a compass. Let us explore if
we can draw these figures with these tools and get familiar with a
compass.

Observe the way a compass is made. What can one draw with the
compass? Explore!

Do you know what curves are? They are any shapes that can be
drawn on paper with a pencil, and include straight lines, circles and
other figures as shown below:

OY

Mark a point P in your notebook. Then, mark as many points as
possible, in different directions, that are 4 cm away from P.

% Think: Imagine marking all the points of 4 cm distance from the
point P. How would they look?

Try to draw it and verify if it is correct by taking some points on
the curve and checking if their distances from P are indeed 4 cm.
Explore, if you have not already done so,

and see if a compass can be used for this a
purpose. SS ao
You can start by marking a few points a
of distance 4 cm from P using the compass. a
How can this be done? pt---- qo 0

Playing with Constructions

You will have to open up the compass against a ruler (see Fig. 8.2)
such that the distance between the tip of the compass and the pencil
is 4cm.

% Now, try to get the full curve.

Hint: Keep the point of the compass fixed moving only the pencil.

What is the shape of the curve? It is a circle!

Take a point on the circle. What will be its distance from P equal
to 4cm, less than 4 cm or greater than 4 cm? Similarly, what will be
the distance between P and another point on the circle?

As shown in the figure, the point P is called the centre of the circle
and the distance between the centre and any point on the circle is
called the radius of the circle.

This figure has two components.

You might have figured out a way of drawing the first part. For
drawing the second part, see this.

The challenge here is to find out where to place the tip of the
compass and the radius to be taken for drawing this curve. You

getting the curve. Use your estimate where to keep the tip.

2. Wavy Wave

As the length of the central line is not specified, we can take it to
be of any length.

Let us take AB to be the central line such that the length of AB is
8 cm. We write this as AB = 8 cm.

8.2 Squares and Rectangles

Now, let us look at some basic figures having straight lines in their

boundary.

iY ||

Fig. 8.3

What shapes are these? Yes, these are our familiar squares and
rectangles. But what makes them squares and rectangles?

Consider this rectangle ABCD.

The points A, B, Cand D are the corners
of the rectangle. Lines AB, BC, CD and DA
are its sides. Its angles are ZA, ZB, ZC
and ZD.

The blue sides AB and CD are called
opposite sides, as they lie opposite to Fig. 8.4
each other. Likewise, AD and BC is the
other pair of opposite sides.

A B

Playing with Constructions

Recall that, in a rectangle:

Ri) The opposite sides are equal in length, and

R2) All the angles are 90 .

As in the case of rectangles, the corners and sides are defined for
a square in the same manner.

A square satisfies the following two properties:

S1) All the sides are equal, and

S2) All the angles are 90 .

See the rectangle in Fig. 8.4 and the name given to it: ABCD. This
rectangle can also be named in other ways BCDA, CDAB, DABC,
ADCB, DCBA, CBAD and BADC. So, can a rectangle be named using
any combination of the labels around its corners? No! For example,
it cannot be named ABDC or ACBD. Can you see what names are
allowed and what names are not?

In a valid name, the corners occur in an order of travel around
the rectangle, starting from any corner.

% Which of the following is not a name for this square?

1. PQSR S y
2. SPOR
3. RSPQ
4. QRSP , 0

Rotated Squares and Rectangles

Here is a square piece of paper
having all its sides equal in length
and all angles equal to 90 . It is
rotated as shown in the figure. Is it
still a square?

Let us check if the rotated paper
still satisfies the properties of a square.

e Are all the sides still equal? Yes.
e Are all the angles still 90 ? Yes.

Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

Rotating a square does not change its
lengths and angles.

Therefore, this rotated figure satisfies both
the properties of a square and so, it is a square.

By the same reasoning, a rotated rectangle
is still a rectangle.

wo Figure it Out

1. Draw the rectangle and four squares configuration (shown in
Fig. 8.3) on a dot paper.
What did you do to recreate this figure so that the four squares
are placed symmetrically around the rectangle? Discuss with
your classmates.

2. Identify if there are any squares in this collection.
Use measurements if needed.

A B C D

%e& Think: Is it possible to reason out if the sides are equal or
not, and if the angles are right or not without using any
measuring instruments in the above figure? Can we do this
by only looking at the position of corners in the dot grid?

3. Draw at least 3 rotated squares and rectangles on a dot grid. Draw
them such that their corners are on the dots. Verify if the squares
and rectangles that you have drawn satisfy their respective
properties.

Imagine X to be a point that can be moved anywhere along
the side AD. Similarly, imagine Y to be a point that can be moved
anywhere along the side BC. Note that X can also be placed
on the end point A or D. Similarly, Y can also be placed on the
end point B or C.

intuition say? Discuss with your classmates.

Now, verify your guesses by placing the points X and Y on the
sides and measure how near or far they are.

The distance between X and Y can be obtained by measuring the
length of the line XY.

How does the minimum distance between the points X and Y
compare to the length of AB?

Change the positions of X and Y to check if there are other
positions where they are at their nearest or farthest. You could
construct multiple copies of the rectangle and try out various
positions of X and Y.

How will you keep track of the lengths XY for different positions
of X and Y?

Here is one way of doing it. Suppose here are some of the positions
of X and Y that you have considered:

e When X is 5 mm away from A and Y is 3 cm away from B,

XY=__ cm__mm
e When X is 1 cm away from A and Y is 1 cm away from B,
XY=_ _ cm__mm
e When X is 2 cm away from A and Y is 4 cm away from B,
XY =___ cm __ mmandso on.
% Is there a shorthand way of writing it down? In all the sentences,
only the position of X, Y and the length XY changes. So we could
write this as:

Playing with Constructions

%ef Have you checked what happens to the length XY when X and Y
are placed at the same distance away from A and B, respectively?
For example, as in the cases like these:

5mm 5mm
1cm 1cm
1cm5 mm 1cm5 mm
and so on.

% In each of these cases, observe
1. how the length XY compares to that of AB and
2. the shape of the 4-sided figure ABYX.

the length of AC? BD?

Breaking Rectangles

in the figure.

Solution
If this seem difficult, let us simplify the problem.

we Explore
What about constructing a rectangle that can be divided into
two identical squares? Can you try it?

It is wise to first plan and then construct. But how do we plan?
Can you think of a way?

One way is to visualise the final figure by drawing a rough
diagram of it.

A B C

What can we infer from this figure?

Can you identify the equal sides?

Since, the two squares are identical,

AB = BC and FE = ED

Since ABEF and BCDE are squares, all the sides in each of the
squares are equal. This is written as 

AF = AB = BE = FE

BE = BC = CD = ED

So, all the shorter lines are equal!

A convention is followed to represent equal sides. It is done by
putting a | on the line. Refer to the rough figure.

Using this analysis, can you try constructing it? Remember, all
that was asked for is a rectangle that can be divided into two
identical squares and with no measurements imposed.

To draw the rectangle ACDF, one could assign any length to AF. For
example, if we assign AF = 4cm, then what must the length of AC be?

% Explore: Can the rectangle now be completed?

In fact, one could proceed by drawing AF without even
measuring its length using a ruler. We could then construct a
line perpendicular to AF that is long enough to contain the other
side. As, AB = AF, we need to somehow transfer the length of AF

Playing with Constructions

to get the point B. How do we do it without a ruler? Can it be
done using a compass?
Observe, how the length of AF is measured using a compass.

Use it to mark out the points B and C, and complete the rectangle.

into three identical squares.

rectangle marking the points as shown and measure the diagonals.
In rectangle PQRS, the right angles at P and R are referred to as
opposite angles. The other pair of opposite angles are the right
angles at Q and S.

Observe that a diagonal divides each of the pair of opposite
angles into two smaller angles. In the figure, the diagonal PR divides
angle R into two smaller angles which we simply call g and h. The
diagonal also divides angle P into c and d. Are g and h equal? Are
c and d equal?

First predict the answers, and then measure the angles. What do
you observe? Identify pairs of angles that are equal.

How should the rectangle be constructed so that the diagonal divides
the opposite angles into equal parts?

How will you record your observations? First, identify the
parameters that need to be tracked. They are the sides of the rectangle

measurements that you would want to keep track of?

STEP 2
Draw a perpendicular to line DC at the point C. Let us call this line LL

D 5 cm Cc

This is easy as we know that this line is perpendicular to the
base. The point B should be somewhere on this line I.

%e& How do we spot it? What else do we know about the position of B?

We know that it is at a distance of 7 cm from the point D.

Playing with Constructions

One of the ways of marking B is by taking a ruler and trying
to move it around to get a point on line / that is 7 cm from point D.
However, this requires trial and error. There is another efficient
method which doesn t involve trial and error.

Forthis,insteadoftryingtogetthatonerequiredpointofdistance
7 cm from D, let us explore a way of getting all the points of
distance 7 cm from D.

We know what this shape is!

STEP 3
Method 1

Construct a circle of radius 7 cm with point D as the centre.

Can you spot the point B here? Remember that it is 7 cm
away from point D and on the line l.

Consider the point at which the circle and the line intersect.
What is its distance from point D? If needed, check your figure.
What do you observe?

The point where the circle intersects the line / is the required
point B.

Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

Method 2

To locate the point B, was it necessary to draw the

entire circle? We can see that only the arc near the line lis needed.
So, the third step can also be done as shown in the figure below.

~

Having marked the three points of the rectangle, we only need
to complete it. Recall that we were in a similar situation in the
previous problem also. We saw two methods of completing the
rectangle from here. We could follow any one of those methods.

STEP 4

Construct perpendiculars to DC and BC passing through D and B,
respectively. The point where these lines intersect is the fourth
point A.

We need to locate the point A that is of distance 5 cm from

construction can be further simplified. How?

If you have guessed that this can be done by the use of
compass, you are right! Go ahead and explore how the point A

The point A can be located by finding the correct point on the
circle that is of distance 5 cm from the point C. Again, this can be
done using a ruler. But can we use a compass for this?

Thus, this is the point A!

Think

Was it necessary to draw two full circles to get the point A? We
only needed part of both the circles.

Method 2
So the point A could have been obtained just by drawing arcs of
radius 5 cm from points B and C.

Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

Join A to B and A to C by straight lines.

Having obtained point A, what remains is the construction
of the remaining arc. How do we do it?

Take 5 cm radius in the compass and from A, draw the arc
