Arvin: If one roti is shared among 5 children, each one gets a

share of roti. If one roti is shared among 9 children,
each one gets a share of roti?

Fractions have been used and named in India since ancient times.
In the Rig Veda, the fraction : is referred to as tri-pada. This has the
same meaning as the words for : in many Indian languages today,
e.g., teen paav in colloquial Hindi and mukkaal in Tamil. Indeed,
words for fractions used today in many Indian languages go back to

ancient times.

languages spoken in your home, city, or state. Ask your grandparents,

Expressing a fraction in lowest terms (or in its simplest
form)

In any fraction, if its numerator and denominator have no common
factor except 1, then the fraction is said to be in lowest terms or in
its simplest form. In other words, a fraction is said to be in lowest
terms if its numerator and denominator are as small as possible.

Any fraction can be expressed in lowest terms by finding an
equivalent fraction whose numerator and denominator are as small
as possible.

Let s see how to express fractions in lowest terms.

Example: Is the fraction is in lowest terms? No, 4is acommon factor
of 16 and 20. Let us reduce os to lowest terms.

We know that both 16 (numerator) and 20 (denominator) are
divisible by 4.
So, 16:4 _4

them.

Expressing a fraction in lowest terms can also be done in steps.

Suppose we want to express = in lowest terms. First, we notice
that both the numerator and denominator are even. So, we divide
36 _ 18
both by 2, and see that <4 = 35.
Both the numerator and denominator are even again, SO we can
divide them each by 2 again; we get 3 = 3.

We now notice that 9 and 15 are both multiples of 3, so we divide
both by 3 to get 3 = 3.

Now, 3 and 5 have no common factor other than 1, so, 26 in lowest

> 60
terms is 3.

Alternatively, we could have noticed thatin ae , both the numerator

and denominator are multiples of 12 : we see that 36 = 3 x 12 and
60 = 5 x 12. Therefore, we could have concluded that 36 = 3 straight away.

Meena s father made some chikki. Meena ate ,
of it and her younger brother ate 5 of it. How

much of the total chikki did Meena and her
brother eat together?

We can arrive at the answer by visualising it. Let us take a piece
of chikki and divide it into two halves first like this.

Meena ate , of it as

shown in the picture.

Let us now divide the

remaining half into two further halves as shown. Each of these

pieces is } of the whole chikki.

Adding fractions with the same fractional unit or

Let us represent both using the rectangular strips. In both fractions,

Adding the two given fractions is the same as finding out the total

This method of addition, which works for adding any number of
fractions, was first explicitly described in general by Brahmagupta
in the year 628 CE! We will describe the history of the development
of fractions in more detail later in the chapter. For now, we simply
summarise the steps in Brahmagupta s method for addition of
fractions.

Brahmagupta s method for adding fractions

1. Find equivalent fractions so that the fractional unit is common
for all fractions. This can be done by finding a common multiple
of the denominators (e.g., the product of the denominators, or the
smallest common multiple of the denominators).

2. Add these equivalent fractions with the same fractional units.
This can be done by adding the numerators and keeping the same
denominator.

3. Express the result in lowest terms if needed.

Let us carry out another example of Brahmagupta s method.
Example: Find the sum of and $.

The denominators of the given fractions are 3 and 5. The lowest
common multiple of 3 and 5 is 15. Then we see that

7.9 A Pinch of History

Do you know what a fraction was called in ancient India? It was
called bhinna in Sanskrit, which means broken . It was also called
bhaga or ansha meaning part or piece .

The way we write fractions today, globally, originated in India. In
ancient Indian mathematical texts, such as the Bakshali manuscript
(from around the year 300 CE), when they wanted to write 5 they
wrote it as 6 which is indeed very similar to the way we write it

today! This method of writing and working with fractions continued
to be used in India for the next several centuries, including by
Aryabhata (499 CE), Brahmagupta (628 CE), Sridharacharya
(c. 750 CE), and Mahaviracharya (c. 850 CE), among others. The line

Fractions

fractions was later introduced by the Moroccan mathematician
Al-Hassar (in the 12th century). Over the next few centuries the
notation then spread to Europe and around the world.

Fractions had also been used in other cultures such as the ancient
Egyptian and Babylonian civilisations, but they primarily used only
fractional units, that is, fractions with a 1 in the numerator. More
general fractions were expressed as sums of fractional units, now
called Egyptian fractions . Writing numbers as the sum of fractional
units, e.g., 52 = 5 + % + @ can be quite an art and leads to beautiful
puzzles. We will consider one such puzzle below.

General fractions (where the numerator is not necessarily 1)
were first introduced in India, along with their rules of arithmetic
operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and even
division of fractions. The ancient Indian treatises called the Sulbasutras shows that even during Vedic times, Indians had discovered
the rules for operations with fractions. General rules and procedures
for working with and computing with fractions were first codified
formally and in a modern form by Brahmagupta.

Brahmagupta s methods for working with and computing with
fractions are still what we use today. For example, Brahmagupta
described how to add and subtract fractions as follows:

 By the multiplication of the numerator and the denominator
of each of the fractions by the other denominators, the fractions
are reduced to a common denominator. Then, in case of addition,
the numerators (obtained after the above reduction) are added.
In case of subtraction, their difference is taken. (Brahmagupta,
Brahmasphutasiddhanta, Verse 12.2, 628 CE)

The Indian concepts and methods involving fractions were
transmitted to Europe via the Arabs over the next few centuries and
they came into general use in Europe in around the 17th century
and then spread worldwide.

However, can you think of a way to add fractional units that
are all different to get 1?
It is not possible to add two different fractional units to get 1.

The reason is that 5 is the largest fractional unit, and 5 + 5 =1.

To get different fractional units, we would have to replace at
least one of the 58 with some smaller fractional unit - but then
the sum would be less than 1! Therefore, it is not possible for
two different fractional units to add up to 1.

We can try to look instead for a way to write 1 as the sum of
three different fractional units. ,

up to 1?

It turns out there is only one solution to this problem
(up to changing the order of the 3 fractions)! Can you
find it? Try to find it before reading further.

Here is a systematic way to find the solution. We know that
;+4+4=1.To get the fractional units to be different, we will have
to increase at least one of the #8; and decrease at least one of the
other zs to compensate for that increase. The only way to increase
; to another fractional unit is to replace it by 5. So 5 must be one of
the fractional units.

Now 5 + 4 + 4 = 1. To get the fractional units to be different, we
will have to increase one of the rs and decrease the other 5 to

compensate for that increase. Now the only way to increase to

another fractional unit, that is different from $, is to replace it by 3.
So two of the fractions must be } and 3! What must be third fraction
then, so that the three fractions add up to 1?

This explains why there is only one solution to the above problem.

What if we look for four different fractional units that add up to 1?

2. Can you find four different fractional units that add_ ,;
up to 1?

It turns out that this problem has six solutions! Can

of two and three fractional units or find your own
method!
