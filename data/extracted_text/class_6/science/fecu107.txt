Lambok and his elder sister
Phiban live in Shillong. One day
they came home from school.
Their parents were away at
work and Lambok complained
that he was feeling feverish.
Phiban touched his forehead
and felt that he might be having
a fever. To confirm this, she
took out the thermometer kept
in the almirah. She washed
its tip with soap and water,
and measured Lambok s
temperature. To her relief, she
found that his temperature
was normal. She washed the
thermometer tip again, dried

it and put it back. She then asked
Lambok to change his school
uniform, eat his lunch, and rest for

some time.

We know from experience that some bodies are hotter than
others. For example, during summers, the tap water may be
hotter than the cold water from a matka (earthen pot) or a

predictions. Did your right hand feel that the water in
container B is cool, while your left hand felt that
the same water is warm? What do you infer
from these observations?

We cannot always rely upon our sense of
touch to decide correctly whether a body is
hot or cold.

Then how do we
find out how hot
or cold a body
is?

7.2. Temperature

A reliable measure of hotness (or coldness) of a body is
its temperature. A hotter body has a higher temperature
than a colder body. The difference in temperature between
the two bodies tells us how hot a body is in comparison to
another body. A device that measures temperature is called
a thermometer.

There are two kinds of thermometers that you are
likely to come _ across clinical thermometers and
laboratory thermometers. Clinical thermometers are used
to measure human body temperatures whereas laboratory
thermometers are used for many other purposes. Let us
now learn more about thermometers and how to use them
to measure temperature.

7.3 Measuring Temperature
7.3.1 Clinical thermometer

You might be familiar with a thermometer, like that shown in
Fig. 7.2, which is used for measuring our body temperature.
It is called a clinical thermometer. Such thermometers show
temperatures digitally. These are also known as digital
clinical thermometers and run on batteries. These measure

temperature when the thermometer is placed in contact
with a person s body.

For measuring temperature, the clinical thermometers
generally use a scale called the Celsius scale. On this
scale, the unit of temperature is degree Celsius and is
denoted by C.

They are non-contact thermometers,
also called infrared
thermometers. Such
thermometers can
measure temperature
without touching a
person s body and
thus reduce the risk of
spreading disease.

The normal temperature ofa healthy human body is taken
to be 37.0 C. But in this activity, did you find that the normal
temperature of every person was 37.0 C? Or did you find the
temperature slightly higher or lower for some people?

The temperature of every person may not
be 37.0 C. What we call normal temperature
is the average body temperature of a large

e healthy person may, therefore, have a
normal temperature slightly different from
37.0 C. The body temperature is influenced
by several factors, such as age, time of the
day and activity level.

analyse your temperature record and see if
there are any variations. If yes, try to think
what might be the reasons for that.

The temperature of human beings does
not normally go below 35 C or above 42 C.

For measuring the body temperature
of small children or old people, the digital
thermometer can also be placed in the
armpit. The temperature measured this way
is about 0.5 C to 1 C lower than the actual
body temperature.

There is another scale of temperature
known as Fahrenheit scale. On this scale, the
unit oftemperature is degree Fahrenheit and
is denoted by F. A temperature measured as
37.0 C on Celsius scale is equivalent to 98.6 F
on Fahrenheit scale. The Fahrenheit scale is
not used in most scientific studies anymore.
In scientific work, there is another scale of
temperature known as Kelvin scale. On this
scale, the unit for temperature is kelvin and
is denoted by K. The SI unit of temperature

7.3.2 Laboratory thermometer

There are many types of laboratory thermometers but the
one that might be available in your school laboratory may
look like the one shown in Fig. 7.3a. It consists of a long,
narrow, uniform glass tube which is sealed. At one end of
the tube is a bulb which contains a liquid. Outside the bulb,
in the tube, a narrow column of liquid can be seen. There
is a Celsius scale marked along the tube. The liquid column
rises or falls with change in temperature. The mark of the
Celsius scale with which the top level of the liquid column

coincides is the temperature reading.

this thermometer can read?

For the thermometer shown in Fig. 7.3b, the
temperature difference indicated between 0 C and
10 C or between 10 C and 20 C is 10 C. And the
number of divisions between these marks are 10
divisions. So, one small division can read 10/10 = 1 C.

That is, the smallest value that this thermometer
can read is 1 C.

Your school laboratory may have thermometers
for which the range and the value of the smallest
division may be different. It is, therefore, always
necessary to look carefully at the thermometer you

Does the maximum and minimum temperature stay at
the same level during these days?

Because weather depends on several factors, these
temperatures usually vary every day. Generally, as we
approach the summer season, the temperature rises and
during the winter season it falls.

The temperature of a body tells us how hot or cold it is.

The three most-used scales of temperature are: (a) the Celsius
scale, (b) the Fahrenheit scale, and (c) the Kelvin scale. The units
of temperature in these scales are (a) degree Celsius, denoted by C,
(b) degree Fahrenheit, denoted by F, and (c) kelvin, denoted by K.

The SI unit for temperature is kelvin.
A clinical thermometer is used for measuring body temperature.
