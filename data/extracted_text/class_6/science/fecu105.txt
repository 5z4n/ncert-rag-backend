Measurement of Length

and Motion

Deepa, a curious eleven-year old girl, livesina
town in the state of Haryana. The new school
year has started. Deepa needs a new uniform
since she has grown taller. Her mother takes
her to acloth shop. She asks for a two-metre
cloth piece. The shopkeeper measures the ee 
cloth using a metal measuring rod.
Sere. Then, the tailor takes her measurements
| | using a flexible measuring tape. Her mother

instructs the tailor to increase the length of her
 /\./ uniform by char angula (four fingers width).
/ @

Are
the tape and rod
similar to the scale that the
elder sister has in her geometry
box? What did mother mean
by char angula?

Deepa shares her experience with her school friends
Anish, Hardeep, Padma, Tasneem and this leads to a
discussion amongst them.

Hardeep says, I have seen my grandmother measuring
cloth by the length of her arm. 

 Have you ever seen how a farmer measures length to
divide his field into beds? He walks and counts the number
of his strides, says Padma.

 Oh, not just the length of the strides sometimes they
also use the length of their feet to measure, adds Anish.

Deepa says excitedly, Measuring length using body parts
must be so much fun! Let us also measure something using
a body part. 

 What should we measure? Okay, let us
measure the length ofthe table in our classroom, 
says Tasneem.

Padma adds, And which body part should
we use to measure it? 

Deepa says, Let us use our handspan. I will
show you how to use it. I have seen my mother
using it. She calls it balisht. 

Hardeep adds, Okay. Let us also note down

Name of the Student Number of Handspans
Anish Slightly more than 13
Padma 13
Tasneem Slightly less than 13
Deepa Between 13 and 14
Hardeep 14

Padma says, Oh, the number of handspans is different for
all of us. So, what can we say about the length of the table? 

 But why should the number be different? Hardeep
asked thoughtfully.

Tasneem says, I can guess. Our handspans are of
different sizes. 

Anish gives an idea, Let us check this. 

So, all five of them put their handspans along each
other and arrive at the conclusion that the lengths of their
handspans are different.

Deepa says thoughtfully, No wonder people use scales
and measuring tapes. 

Deepa and her friends compare the length of the table
with the length of their handspans. The length of the table is
expressed in terms of their handspans. Here, the handspan
used for measurement is an example ofa unit. And the length
is expressed in two parts, anumber and a unit. For example,
if the length of the table is found to be 13 handspans, then
13 is the number and handspar is the unit selected for the
measurement.

However, handspans and other similar units, such as
length of hand, foot, fist or fingers, differ from person to
person. Thus, there is a need for such a unit for which
measurements of the same length made by different people
do not differ.

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6

Chapter 5.indd 82

Several systems of units evolved with time in
different parts of the world. However, when
people started travelling from one place to
another, it created a lot of confusion. This led
to the different countries coming together
and adopting a set of standard units of
measurement. The system of units now used is
known as the International System of Units or
SI units.

The SI unit of length is metre. Its symbol
is m. A metre scale is shown in Fig. 5.2. One
metre (m) is divided into 100 equal divisions.
Each division is called a centimetre (cm). You
may be familiar with a smaller part of the
metre scale, typically 15 cm long, shown in
Fig. 5.3.

Look carefully at the 15-cm scale. It has
markings (in cm) from 0 to 15. The length
of any section between two consecutive big
marks, such as between 1 and 2 or between
5 and 6, is 1 cm. Observe that these sections

of 1 cm length are further divided
into 10 equal parts. The length of
one of these smaller parts is called
a millimetre (mm). 1 mm is the
smallest value of length that you
can measure using this scale. 1 mm
is equal to one-tenth of a centimeter
(1 mm = 0.1 cm).

For measuring larger lengths, we
use a larger unit called a kilometre
(km) which is equal to 1000 metres.
And for measuring smaller lengths,
we use units such as centimetre or
millimetre.

Would it be convenient to use

the unit metre to measure
larger lengths, such as the
length of a railway track
between two cities, or to
measure smaller lengths,
such as the thickness of a
page of a book?

es 5.3 Correct Way of Measuring Length

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6

Chapter 5.indd 84

For measuring any length, we need an appropriate scale.
For example, if you want to measure the length of your
pencil, you may use a 15-cm scale. Similarly, if the height of
a room is to be measured, you may need a metre scale or a
measuring tape. You cannot directly measure the girth of a
tree or the size of your chest using a metre scale. For such
measurements, flexible measuring tape, such as a tailor s
tape is more suitable.

While measuring lengths, we need to take care of some
points.

What is the correct way to place the scale?

Place the scale in contact with the object along its length as
shown in Fig. 5.4.

(a) Correct (b) Incorrect

Fig. 5.4: Method of placing the scale

What is the correct position of the eye while reading
the scale?

For example, if you are trying to measure the length of a
pencil by aligning it with a scale, the position of your eye
should be directly above the tip of the pencil (Fig. 5.5).

How to measure the length if the ends of the scale
are broken?

If the ends of the scale are broken or the zero marking
is not clear, it can still be used for measurement. With
such a scale, use any other full mark of the scale, say, 1.0
cm (Fig. 5.6). Then you must subtract the reading of this
mark from the reading at the other end. For example, in
Fig. 5.6, the reading at one end is 1.0 cm and at the other
end, it is 10.4 cm. Therefore, the length of the object is
10.4 cm-1.0 cm = 9.4 cm.

Who do you think is correct? All of them are correct
(Fig. 5.9). Then, why are their observations different? They
are locating the distances of the school and garden from their
houses. If, instead, each of them had thought of distances
from a same object or point, say, the bus stand, then their
observations would have been the same.

When distance is stated with respect to a fixed object or
point, then this point is called a reference point.

A few days later, Hardeep tells his friends excitedly,

Deepa looked around her in the bus and noticed that all

the passengers were seated. She looked around again after

a minute and found them still occupying their seats. She
wondered, Are they moving? She concluded that the position
of the passengers was not changing with time. Therefore, they
were certainly at rest. However, when she looked outside, she
felt they were in motion as their positions were changing with
respect to things outside.

The reference point is important in deciding whether an object

is at rest or in motion. If Deepa considered herself (or

the bus) as the reference point, then the passengers

were at rest. However, if she considered any object J

outside the bus (say a building) as the reference point,
