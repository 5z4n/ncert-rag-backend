Amber returned from :
school and sat down in
the shade of the neem
tree in her courtyard.
She felt that the tree
was whispering to her.
She looked at the tree
and spoke to the tree.

Amber : Namaste! I am Amber. I would like to talk to you.
May I?

Neem Baba : Sure, dear Amber. I know you. You played in my
shade in your childhood. You may call me Neem
Baba .

Amber : Ihave seen you almost everywhere. Please tell me
something more about yourself.

Neem Baba :I am very old. I was born millions of years ago
somewhere in North India or Myanmar. Soon, my
family spread outside India.

Amber : Outside India? Where else can neem be found?

Neem Baha : My family can be found in many Asian and African
countries and even in some parts of America.

The story of my name is very
thought-provoking. I was born
in India and given Sanskrit
names such as Arishta (the one
who cures diseases), Nimba and
Nimbaca. The name Neem is
given by the Iranians.

: Really?

Yes, in Hindi, my name is Nimb. In
India, I have other names Nim,
Leemba, Nimori, Nimbamond,
Nimbe and Nimo.

: You are so well known! That is

wonderful.

Dear Amber, we become well
known for what we do. People
find us useful and that is why
they know us. Scientists call us
 bitter grace of God , nature s gift
to man , and cleanliness-parting

Amber :I know that people clean their
teeth with your twigs and
protect clothes with your leaves.
Sometime back, when my brother
had measles, the doctor told us to
put neem leaves on his bed and
make him lie down on them. Can
you explain why?

Neem Baba: The doctors know that neem

leaves have chemical properties

that destroy germs. Measles
cause itching all over the body.

Neem leaves give comfort and do

not allow germs to breed. Neem

leaves, bark, flowers, fruits and
even roots can be used to make
medicines to cure many diseases.

grandmother cured me with a
medicine made from neem bark.
And when my father had itching
in the eyes, she prepared a kajal

him.

: Oh, little Amber, you know so

much. Remember, these remedies
are to be used only by people who
are well trained and have a lot of
experience.

: Yes, I will. Tell me Neem Baba,

is there any use of neem for the
farmers?

: Yes. If the powder of neem seeds

is mixed in water and sprayed
on plants and trees, then locusts
don t eat them. If it is used in
rice fields, where water remains
standing, it stops mosquito
breeding and helps to increase
crop yield. It also saves the crop
from termites, which eat roots
of the crop, and it also stops
breeding of other insects that eat
crops.

: That means, if we put the powder

of neem seeds in stagnant water

Neem Baha : Ofcourse. People save their stored
grains from insects by adding
neem seed powder to them. Neem
oil is also used to make soaps
and toothpaste. Furniture made
from neem wood is not eaten
by termites. Neem also purifies
the air. There are many qualities

Namaste! I just got your message that you are better now.

I am happy that the natural cures that I had shared, helped you. You should
try to remember these cures and may share them with your friends. When
I was a child, I learnt them from my grandmother. She used to find home
remedies for most of the weather-related common illnesses. Let me share

our energy level and digestion. It helps in reducing body pain too.

Next, let us take methi, which is called fenugreek in English. You will be
surprised to know that it helps me in keeping my sugar level and my body
weight in control. [need to soak the methi seeds overnight and drink the water
in the morning.

* Jeera (cumin) seeds soaked in water overnight can also improve digestion and
help cure sleeplessness.

 You know, when you were babies and had gas in your tummy, I used to put
heeng (asafoetida) water on your tummy to give you some relief. Heeng
can also help in controlling cough and cold.

e Dalchini (cinnamon) and laung (clove) give relief when we have toothache
till we can consult a dentist.

e Adrak (ginger) is another herb that can help us when we have cough and
cold. It also gives relief from pain. Do you know, ginger has been used in
cooking for more than 4000 years? Even today, it is extensively used in
cooking Indian food.

 Kali mirch (black pepper) is also helpful in digestion and can give us relief
from body pain.

 You may have seen that at the end of a meal, saunf (fennel seeds) and
ajwain (carom seeds) are served. It is because they help in the digestion of
food.

 Elaichi (cardamom) also helps us with digestion and respiratory troubles
in addition to curing bad breath.
